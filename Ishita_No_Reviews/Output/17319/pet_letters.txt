From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

Hey there, it's me, your little secret agent of fluff and mischief‚Äîalso known as Pet. I thought it was time I shared some thoughts about our life together, mainly because I've been storing them up in my whiskers and, well, they tickle quite a bit.

First off, thank you for understanding my fascination with covert operations. You know when I suddenly vanish into my Kaytee Sleep-E-Tent? It's not just a hideout; it's my fortress of introspection. I know you sometimes peek in, and I pretend not to notice, but I do. It's one of my favorite pastimes‚Äîwatching you search for me with that mix of concern and amusement.

These daily disappearing acts are a testament to how much I love being curious. Every nook and cranny of our shared space is a new adventure. I appreciate how you've made this world safe for my small self. You rearrange those towering books and gadgets, ensuring I never tumble into trouble. It's a kindness not lost on this tiny explorer.

You might find it funny, but the world seems enormous from my perspective. Yet, you've made it feel cozy and navigable. Your gentle hands and soft voice guide me through the unknown, and for that, I'm perpetually grateful. You truly are my favorite giant.

Let's not forget those moments we share when I'm not in stealth mode. You know how to make a game out of anything, and I love that about you. Whether it's chasing after a crumpled paper ball or playing peek-a-boo from behind my tent, you fill my life with joy and laughter.

So, thank you, dear human, for being my partner in this whimsical dance of life. I may be small, and I may weigh less than your morning coffee, but my heart is full of love for you. Here‚Äôs to many more playful days and curious nights.

With all the love my tiny heart can muster,

Pet üêæ
