From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

Hey there! It's me, your large and lovable furball, Pet! I thought I'd take a break from chasing my tail and write you a little something from the heart. I know, I know, you're probably wondering how a curious canine like me manages to type, but I have my ways. I'm resourceful like that!

First off, thank you for always keeping my PetRageous Designs Batik Bones Pet Bowl filled with all the good stuff. It's the little things, like when you scratch my favorite spot behind the ears, or when you laugh at my goofy antics, that make my tail wag like crazy. 

Remember that time I stole your sock and you chased me around the house? Ah, what fun! I love how playful we can be together. Your laugh is the best sound in the world, and I can't help but bounce around with joy whenever I hear it. 

Hey, I know I can sometimes be a little too curious (like the time I stuck my head in the laundry basket and got stuck—oops!), but I promise I'm always trying to be the best buddy I can be. You're my whole world, and I love exploring it with you by my side.

I also want to mention how much I appreciate you for looking out for my safety. You always make sure I'm well-trained and keep an eye on me, even when I'm off chasing butterflies or when I get a little too brave and try to climb trees (don’t worry, I’ve finally figured out they’re not as easy as they look!). 

And hey, I noticed you got me those Soft Claws Nail Caps for Cats. I wasn’t sure if you were aware I’m more of a “woof” than a “meow,” but I appreciate the thought! They make my paws look quite fashionable, don't you think? 

Lastly, just know that in my heart, you're my favorite human ever. Let’s keep making paw-some memories together, okay?

With a wagging tail and lots of love,

Pet 🐾
