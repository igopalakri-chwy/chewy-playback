The vet said she'd have to wear an Ecollar for 10 days and I knew she would not be happy in the one that vet was going to provide her as she dislikes being restricted in general.

The vet had low hopes for this soft Ecollar but it worked very well for us. While I can't say she was happy about wearing it she acclimated fairly easily. I did start taking it off for her to eat because I'd only purchased one and didn't want food stains on it (buy 2 - this way you can wash one while the other is being worn). 

I liked that you could push it either towards the face, or towards the body so the cat can see better while walking. This was important as mine was wearing a ""cast"" and having enough trouble as it was getting around. 

I did prevent her from being able to reach the healing foot and lick on it, which was exactly what we'd hoped for. And she was able to sleep well with it since it cradled her head and neck nicely.

However, towards the end of the 10 days when she was moving around much better she managed to pull it loose enough to put her foot through - so she was walking with one foot out of the collar in the front. Not a huge deal but perhaps this is better for those instances where you only need to use it for a week or less. Hence my 4 star review, not 5 on this.

Overall though very pleased and the vet thought she looked adorable wearing it too!",true,APPROVED,4,sivyaleah,"{

I literally spend two hours at the end of each week, reconstructing her toys. These squeakers were purchased for that task. Right now we have a headless eagle (the wings still crinkle invitingly), a decapatated raccoon, and a hedgehog which are the favorites. Unfortunately, even with being wrapped in a special canvas pack, she punched holes through each of these squeakers immediately.

  ""ReviewText"": ""Ok, so my girl, Cleo, is a shredding/chewing/munching monstrosity- that makes me feel lucky because she drops rather than swallows each piece of toy she dismantles. I literally spend two hours at the end of each week, reconstructing her toys. These squeakers were purchased for that task. Right now we have a headless eagle (the wings still crinkle invitingly), a decapatated raccoon, and a hedgehog which are the favorites. Unfortunately, even with being wrapped in a special canvas pack, she punched holes through each of these squeakers immediately. \n\nNow, if your dog isn’t a tough a$s chewer like mine- and loves replacement squeaks, then get these!"",

I tried to give him an easy transition by allowing both old and new box, but he wouldn't use new box until old one was removed. But no issues once he switched. The ramp catches some of the litter that sticks to his feet, but I'd say overall tracking is same or a little worse than the top-entry box. But, what are you gonna do? Old cats need extra care.

This bone is large enough for him to hold between his paws and gnaw for as long as he wants. The nubs are great for scraping his teeth. The only thing is that you need to make sure to occasionally peel off any tiny loose bits which may appear so they don't ingest or choke on them. But when it gets too ratty looking we purchase a new one. One lasts us anywhere from 3-5 months, depending on how much time he spends chewing on it.

  ""ReviewText"": ""Our three year old, 60 pound English Shepherd is an avid chewer. Our vet recommended the Nylabone brand of products and we've been SO happy with them! Our dog's favorite flavor is peanut butter and he adores the flavor. This bone is large enough for him to hold between his paws and gnaw for as long as he wants. The nubs are great for scraping his teeth. The only thing is that you need to make sure to occasionally peel off any tiny loose bits which may appear so they don't ingest or choke on them. But when it gets too ratty looking we purchase a new one. One lasts us anywhere from 3-5 months, depending on how much time he spends chewing on it. We really like the variety of shapes, flavors and textures so we can change it up for our dog."",

As per my vet's recommendation, I'm trying to focus on 'crunchy' treats because one of our dogs is getting a problem with tartar on her teeth. I think these Milk-Bone biscuits will help her."",

Before she got the supplements she was taking another brand but was even happier with these and they seem to be helping. Thank you PetHonesty and Chewy!"",

  ""ReviewText"": ""Our cat was clearly not brought up being comfortable with teeth brushing (we rescued her when she was 7 years old) so getting inside of her mouth for teeth maintenance is not a viable option for everyday care. Luckily we came across DentaLife (we have had zero luck with Greenies, they have upset our kitty's stomach pretty aggressively) and not only does she love them, but they have reduced her tartar immensely, and given her much better breath! She is drawn to how good they taste, and we can feel good knowing that our furbaby is getting her teeth cleaned each time she chomps down on one of these."",

They last forever as long as you don’t lose them and they have been his constant favorite since day 1. I ordered a medium for my 8week old puppy and it’s the exact size of a tennis ball and perfect size for his little puppy mouth! My 7 year old dog has been playing with the large size his entire life! They are super bouncy so maybe not the best for inside play if your dog gets rowdy."",

This happened the day I took it out and it really wasn’t played with. My dogs definitely weren’t excited about it but I do purchase balls to bring to the park for my dogs “friends” I keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t get destroyed or over played with and it was the first day it was out. I purchase so many balls/toys and I bring them out a little bit at a time. Since we can’t park inside the park yet, I’m just bringing certain toys in, since I can’t carry everything my car can, while walking two larger dogs at the same time.

I gave her 2 vitamin bites per day for 90 days and then just 1 there after. My boxer is like a new dog. She is able to get up the stairs much better, walk longer, run around, and get in the truck by herself again. Honestly, I can’t believe it! She is playful most days which I didn’t want expect. I’m overall very happy with this joint vitamin. She likes the taste of the vitamin which is helpful. I recommend this vitamin if your dog is battling arthritis as an alternative to pain medication from the vet. This vitamin does work!"",
