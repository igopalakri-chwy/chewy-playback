Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5025337
============================================================

Human,

Hey there! It's us‚ÄîHarley (James) Davidson, The Princess Monaco, Venison, and Turkey, wagging our tails in excitement as we write this together. We just wanted to remind you how much brighter you make our lives each day. We know we can be a handful, especially when we're all competing for the squeakiest toy or the last piece of our favorite Natural Balance sweet potato & venison meal.

Harley here! I'm the food lover of the pack, and I promise to keep the wee-wee pads in place. You know I'll always be waiting by the pantry when you open the door, ready for a new treat adventure!

Princess Monaco chiming in! I may be small, but my love for you is as grand as my title. Thanks for understanding my sensitive tummy and always providing the best grain-free goodies. And yes, I admit it, those rope toys are the best for my chewing delight.

Venison popping by! Variety is the spice of life, and you've mastered the art of keeping my meals exciting. I adore our walks on that trusty Mendota leash. Each step is a new journey with you.

Turkey signing on! I'm the quiet observer, always ready with a nuzzle or a wag when you need it most. Our family, including our other furry friends, stands together, tail-wags in sync, because of your love and care.

Thank you for seeing us as individuals and as a family. We cherish every moment with you.

With all our tiny hearts,

Harley, The Princess Monaco, Venison, & Turkey üêæ
