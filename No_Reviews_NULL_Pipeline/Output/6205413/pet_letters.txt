From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

I hope you can read my paw-writing because I’ve got something important to say! First off, you rock my world, and not just because you let me keep my wardrobe trendier than Paris Fashion Week. Honestly, who would've thought a mixed-breed cutie like me would have the chance to strut around in a penn + pooch Classic Babe Dog T-Shirt? The rose color really complements my coat, don’t you think? It’s like I’m the fashion icon this neighborhood never knew it needed.

But beyond the glam and the glitz, it’s those little moments that matter most to me—the way you giggle every time I nuzzle up wearing my Dapper Dog costume (I mean, I have to admit, I look like a canine James Bond). I love how I can make you laugh with my curious antics, like when I find the most bizarre hiding spots for my toys. Who knew under the couch was such prime real estate?

You’ve made my world a magical place, and for that, I’m eternally grateful. Whether we’re playing in the park, or just lounging around and enjoying some Whole Earth Farms beef and turkey pate—yes, I know it’s technically cat food, but my taste buds beg to differ—you make every day feel like a grand adventure.

Of course, none of this would be possible if you weren’t so wonderfully you. You’ve taught me that life is best lived with a wagging tail and a wardrobe to match. Your love is as warm as the sunbeam I nap in every afternoon, and I promise, I’ll always be here to share it with you.

Thank you for choosing a playful, curious soul like me to be your furry companion. Here’s to more adventures, more costumes, and more laughter. And don’t worry, I’ll keep bringing the charm and the mischief!

Love with all my paws,
Pet
