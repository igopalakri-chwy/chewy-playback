# Chewy Playback Pipeline - Project Memory

## Project Overview
AI-powered pet intelligence pipeline that analyzes customer data to create personalized pet profiles and recommendations. Uses Snowflake database integration with LLM analysis for comprehensive pet insights.

## Architecture Overview

### Main Pipeline (`chewy_playback_pipeline.py`)
- **Entry Point**: Orchestrates entire pipeline execution
- **Database**: Connects to Snowflake for customer data retrieval
- **Caching System**: Single cache entry per customer with 10 optimized queries
- **Dual Agent Architecture**:
  - `ReviewOrderIntelligenceAgent`: For customers WITH reviews (enhanced pet detection)
  - `OrderIntelligenceAgent`: For customers WITHOUT reviews (order-only analysis)
- **Output**: Generates enriched pet profiles, letters, portraits, and metadata

## Enhanced Pet Detection System (MAJOR RECENT UPDATE)

### Core Innovation: LLM + Hashmap Approach
Replaced hard-coded regex patterns with intelligent LLM analysis that detects three types of additional pets:

#### 1. Count-Based Detection
- **Scenario**: Customer has 2 cats in Snowflake, review says "my 3 cats"
- **Action**: Creates `Additional_Cat_1` 
- **Method**: `count_based_detection`

#### 2. Named Pet Detection  
- **Scenario**: Review mentions "Charlie loves this toy" but Charlie not in profiles
- **Action**: Creates pet profile named `Charlie` with detected species
- **Method**: `named_pet_detection`

#### 3. Unnamed Species Detection
- **Scenario**: Review says "my dog" but no dogs exist in profiles  
- **Action**: Creates `UNK_DOG` profile
- **Method**: `unnamed_species_detection`

### Key Methods (ReviewOrderIntelligenceAgent)
- `_detect_additional_pets_with_llm()`: Main detection orchestrator with order context
- `_analyze_pet_ownership_with_llm()`: GPT-4 analysis returning structured data with species inference
- `_infer_species_from_orders()`: NEW - Infers pet species from purchase history patterns
- `analyze_customer_with_cached_data()`: Pipeline integration point with enhanced detection

## Coding Conventions

### General Rules
- **NO COMMENTS**: Never add code comments unless explicitly requested by user
- **Concise Responses**: Keep explanations under 4 lines unless asked for detail
- **Existing Patterns**: Always check existing code patterns before implementing
- **Library Usage**: Never assume libraries are available - check imports/package.json first

### Error Handling Patterns
```python
try:
    # Main logic
    result = some_operation()
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Operation failed, using fallback: {e}")
    result = fallback_value
```

### LLM Integration Patterns
```python
# Standard LLM call structure
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=self.openai_api_key)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[...],
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=2000
)
```

### Data Structure Conventions
```python
# Pet profile structure with detection metadata
pet_profile = {
    "PetName": "string",
    "PetType": "string", 
    "DetectionSource": "review_analysis",      # For detected pets
    "DetectionMethod": "count_based_detection", # Specific detection type
    "DetectionType": "count_based"             # Category of detection
}
```

## Pipeline-Specific Terminology

### Detection Methods
- **count_based_detection**: Detected from quantity mentions ("my 3 cats")
- **named_pet_detection**: Detected from specific names ("Charlie loves this")  
- **unnamed_species_detection**: Detected from species mentions ("my dog")

### Pet Types & Naming
- **Additional_[Species]_[Number]**: Count-based additional pets (e.g., `Additional_Cat_1`)
- **UNK_[SPECIES]**: Unnamed species pets (e.g., `UNK_DOG`)
- **[Name]**: Named pets detected from reviews (e.g., `Charlie`)

### Data Flow Terms
- **Snowflake Cache**: Single optimized data fetch per customer (10 queries)
- **Known Pet Profiles**: Pets from Snowflake database
- **Additional Pets**: Pets detected from review analysis
- **Enhanced Pet Detection**: The complete LLM + hashmap system
- **Generic Playback**: Content for customers without pet profiles but with sufficient orders
- **Confidence Thresholds**: 0.3+ (generic), 0.6+ (personalized)

### Agent Types
- **ReviewOrderIntelligenceAgent**: For customers with reviews (enhanced detection)
- **OrderIntelligenceAgent**: For customers without reviews (order-only + generic playback)

## Recent Major Changes Completed

### 1. Enhanced Pet Detection Implementation ✅
- Completely rewrote `detect_additional_pets_from_reviews` method
- Replaced regex patterns with GPT-4 LLM analysis
- Added hashmap comparison of known vs detected pet counts
- Implemented three distinct detection scenarios with proper metadata

### 2. Code Cleanup & Organization ✅
- Removed dead code (`_select_priority_reviews` method)
- Added comprehensive documentation and section headers
- Extracted constants (`PRIORITY_REVIEW_KEYWORDS`)
- Improved error handling consistency across all methods
- Streamlined method organization and data flow

### 3. Pipeline Integration ✅
- Enhanced `analyze_customer_with_cached_data()` method
- Added detection metadata to output profiles
- Implemented proper review filtering for different pet types
- Added comprehensive logging for detection results

### 4. Species Inference Enhancement ✅
- **Problem Solved**: Handle pet names mentioned in reviews without explicit species
- **New Method**: `_infer_species_from_orders()` - analyzes order history for species clues
- **Enhanced LLM Prompt**: Now accepts "unknown" species and tries context inference
- **Smart Confidence Scoring**:
  - Named pet with known/inferred species: `0.8` confidence
  - Named pet with unknown species: `0.5` confidence (adjusted for uncertainty)
- **Order-Based Inference**: Uses cat litter, dog treats, bird seed patterns to infer species
- **Updated Validation**: Added "unknown" as valid species type in processing logic
- **Enhanced Data Flow**: All detection methods now pass order context for better species inference

### 5. Enhanced OrderIntelligenceAgent (NEW - LATEST UPDATE) ✅
- **Problem Solved**: Customers without pet profiles were excluded from playback despite having order history
- **Generic Playback System**: Customers with ≥5 orders but no pet profiles now receive generic playback
- **Implementation**: Added `_generic_playback_eligible` marker with confidence score 0.4
- **Confidence Thresholds**: 
  - Generic playback: confidence ≥ 0.3
  - Personalized playback: confidence ≥ 0.6
- **User Experience**: Encourages profile completion with message "Complete your pet profiles for personalized insights!"
- **Validation**: Tested with customer 151327624 (8 orders, no profiles) - successfully receives generic content

### 6. Critical Bug Fixes ✅
- **Variable Scope Error**: Fixed `customer_id` parameter missing in `_parse_llm_response()` method
- **Cat-Gets-Dog-Products Bug**: Fixed product contamination in `_fix_product_categorization()` method
- **Cuddliest Month Extraction**: Fixed data access bug in `save_outputs()` method that caused null values
  - **Root Cause**: Method accessed processed pet profiles instead of raw Snowflake cache data
  - **Solution**: Updated to use `self._get_cached_customer_data()` for accurate data retrieval
  - **Also Fixed**: Donation data and total months extraction using same pattern

### 7. Performance Optimization ✅
- **Snowflake Caching**: Implemented single bulk data fetch per customer (10 queries → 1 call)
- **Cache Hits**: Multiple pipeline stages now reuse cached data instead of re-querying
- **Performance Gain**: Dramatically faster execution with "Using cached ALL data" pattern
- **Note**: Keyring warning only affects authentication pop-ups, not data caching performance

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ **Enhanced pet detection system**: Fully implemented and production-ready
- ✅ **Species inference system**: Complete with order-based inference and confidence scoring  
- ✅ **Generic playback system**: Active customers without profiles receive generic content
- ✅ **Critical bug fixes**: All data extraction and processing issues resolved
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: Single-call Snowflake caching implemented
- ✅ **Code cleanup**: All test/debug files removed, production-ready

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Project
1. **Check existing patterns** before implementing new features
2. **Use the enhanced pet detection system** for any review analysis
3. **Follow the dual agent architecture** - don't mix review and order-only logic
4. **Maintain Snowflake caching** - use `_get_all_customer_data()` method
5. **Include detection metadata** for any additional pets created
6. **Test with real customer data** from the Output directory examples

### Testing & Verification
- Check Output directory for real customer examples (e.g., 151327624 for generic playback)
- Verify Snowflake queries work with existing cache structure
- Ensure LLM analysis handles edge cases gracefully
- Test generic playback with customers having ≥5 orders but no pet profiles
- Validate cuddliest month, donation, and other cached data extractions

## Environment Requirements
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for LLM analysis (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **Snowflake Connection**: Database credentials for customer data
- **Python Dependencies**: pandas, openai, snowflake-connector-python

This pipeline represents a significant evolution from simple pattern matching to intelligent AI-powered pet detection that dramatically improves data quality and customer profile completeness.
