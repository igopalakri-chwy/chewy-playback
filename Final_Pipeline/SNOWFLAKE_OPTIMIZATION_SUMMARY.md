# Snowflake Query Optimization Summary

## Problem Identified

The original pipeline was running the same Snowflake queries multiple times unnecessarily:

1. **In `run_intelligence_agent()`**: Called `get_customer_data()` which runs ALL 4 queries
2. **In `_run_review_agent_for_customer()`**: Called individual dataframe methods that ran the same queries again
3. **In `_run_order_agent_for_customer()`**: Called individual dataframe methods that ran the same queries again  
4. **In `run_narrative_generation_agent()`**: Called `_get_customer_reviews()` and `_get_customer_orders_for_narrative()` which ran the same queries again
5. **In `run_breed_predictor_agent()`**: Potentially more queries

**Result**: For each customer, the same 4 Snowflake queries were being executed 3-4 times, leading to:
- Unnecessary database load
- Slower pipeline execution
- Higher costs
- Potential rate limiting issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Caching Mechanism

Added a customer data cache to the `ChewyPlaybackPipeline` class:

```python
# Data caching to avoid running the same Snowflake queries multiple times
self._customer_data_cache = {}
```

### 2. Cached Data Access Methods

Created new methods that check the cache first before making Snowflake queries:

```python
def _get_cached_customer_data(self, customer_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get customer data from cache or fetch from Snowflake if not cached."""
    if customer_id not in self._customer_data_cache:
        print(f"    🔍 Fetching data from Snowflake for customer {customer_id}...")
        customer_data = self.snowflake_connector.get_customer_data(customer_id)
        self._customer_data_cache[customer_id] = customer_data
        print(f"    ✅ Cached data for customer {customer_id}")
    else:
        print(f"    📋 Using cached data for customer {customer_id}")
    
    return self._customer_data_cache[customer_id]
```

### 3. Updated All Data Access Methods

Replaced all direct Snowflake calls with cached versions:

- `_get_cached_customer_orders_dataframe()`
- `_get_cached_customer_reviews_dataframe()`
- `_get_cached_customer_pets_dataframe()`
- `_get_cached_customer_address()`

### 4. Cache Management Features

Added cache management capabilities:

```python
def clear_cache(self):
    """Clear the customer data cache."""
    self._customer_data_cache.clear()
    print("✅ Customer data cache cleared")

def get_cache_stats(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Get cache statistics."""
    return {
        'cached_customers': len(self._customer_data_cache),
        'total_queries_saved': len(self._customer_data_cache) * 4  # 4 queries per customer
    }
```

## Results

### Before Optimization
- **Queries per customer**: 12-16 queries (4 queries × 3-4 calls)
- **Total queries for 1 customer**: ~15 queries
- **Performance**: Slower due to repeated database calls

### After Optimization
- **Queries per customer**: 4 queries (executed once, cached)
- **Total queries for 1 customer**: 4 queries
- **Performance**: 75% reduction in database queries
- **Cache hit rate**: 100% for subsequent data access

### Example Output
```
📊 Cache Statistics:
   Customers cached: 1
   Queries saved: 4
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: 75% reduction in Snowflake queries
2. **Cost**: Significantly reduced database compute costs
3. **Reliability**: Reduced risk of rate limiting or connection issues
4. **Scalability**: Better performance when processing multiple customers
5. **Monitoring**: Clear visibility into cache efficiency

## Implementation Details

### Cache Structure
```python
self._customer_data_cache = {
    'customer_id': {
        'query_1': [...],  # Order data
        'query_2': [...],  # Review data  
        'query_3': [...],  # Pet data
        'query_4': [...]   # Address data
    }
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **First access**: Fetch from Snowflake, cache results
2. **Subsequent access**: Return cached data
3. **Pipeline completion**: Show cache statistics

### Error Handling
- Cache misses fall back to Snowflake queries
- Graceful handling of connection issues
- Clear logging of cache hits/misses

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Cache**: Save cache to disk for cross-session persistence
2. **Cache Expiration**: Implement TTL for cached data
3. **Memory Management**: Limit cache size for large customer sets
4. **Cache Warming**: Pre-load data for known customer lists
5. **Metrics**: Track cache hit rates and performance improvements

## Files Modified

- `Final_Pipeline/chewy_playback_pipeline.py`: Added caching mechanism
- `Final_Pipeline/snowflake_data_connector.py`: Added helper method for dataframe conversion

This optimization significantly improves the pipeline's efficiency while maintaining all existing functionality.
