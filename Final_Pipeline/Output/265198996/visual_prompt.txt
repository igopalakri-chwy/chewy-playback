Picture three joyful dogs: a Labrador Retriever and two mixed breed dogs. They're of varying sizes, with weights ranging from 27 to 83 pounds and they are all adults. The Labrador Retriever is the heaviest and oldest of the pack, radiating a calm and mature energy. They are in a modern Southwestern-style setting, with earthy tones and rough textures that reflect the Desert Modern aesthetic. The background subtly features a desert landscape with a mountainous horizon, evoking the natural beauty of Queen Creek, AZ. The dogs are the focus of the scene, happily playing with a large, tough rubber ball. Nearby, a Chewy-branded bowl filled with the delicious bone broth topper awaits them. The scene is well-lit, brimming with vibrant, cheerful energy, and the feeling of authentic warmth and sophistication.
