Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 265198996
============================================================

Dear Human,

Woofs and tail wags from Momo, Coco, and Laddoo! We've been thoroughly enjoying our chewy treats lately, especially those chicken flavored dental sticks. Yum! We also love the bone broth topper that gets mixed into our food; it makes our tails wag so much, you'd think we were helicopters. And donâ€™t even get us started on the peanut butter lickable treats! We can't resist its nutty goodness. There's nothing like a good day of play, followed by a satisfying meal and a snuggle on our soft beds. We're pretty sure we're living the doggie dream!

With sloppy kisses and wagging tails,
Momo, Coco and Laddoo
