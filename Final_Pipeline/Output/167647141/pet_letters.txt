Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 167647141
============================================================

Dear Human,

You've probably noticed how much we wag our tails when you bring out the delicious, grain-free chicken dry food, or how we do zoomies around the living room once you open a bag of those grilled steak flavored kibbles. Just thinking about them makes us do the happy dance! We're also super grateful for the cozy crate end table you've provided - it's the perfect spot for us to curl up and dream about all the wonderful treats you spoil us with. The soft toys you've given us are also so much fun to play with. They squeak just right and are perfect for a game of fetch or tug-of-war. And let's not forget about our horse friend, Lightning. He loves the refreshing showers he gets from the hose, and he surely appreciates the spacious and comfy barn you've set up.

With all our love and zoomies, Diego, Dexter, Emma, Layla, and Lightning
