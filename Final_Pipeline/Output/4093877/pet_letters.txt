Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4093877
============================================================

Hello Hooman,

We, Shaomaomi and Tuxedo, have decided to hijack your device to express our joy. We are head over paws for the new soft and appetizing pate you got us. Believe it or not, even we, the notorious finicky eaters, clean our bowls each time! And that special dry food you sprinkle on top? Delish! It's like a garnish to our gourmet meal.

We also appreciate you stepping up our dental game with that finger toothbrush. It's a fun chase when you try to brush our teeth, but we're too smart for you, aren't we? Can't wait for our next game of hide and seek!

Love,
Shaomaomi and Tuxedo
