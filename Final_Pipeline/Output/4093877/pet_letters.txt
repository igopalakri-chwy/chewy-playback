Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4093877
============================================================

Purr-fect greetings!  We're Shaomaomi and Tuxedo, your lovable and smart felines, writing to you from our cozy cat tree. We simply wanted to express how much we adore the savory and soft pâté meals you’ve been giving us lately. The beef and liver concoction, oh, it gives us the zoomies of joy! We've been licking our bowls clean, even though we are known to be finicky eaters. The chicken variety packs and the trout and catfish pâté meals are purr-fectly delightful too. We've been having a grand time trying to outwit you with the finger toothbrush as well. But remember, we are too smart and quick for you! Wishing you a sophisticated and metropolitan day, filled with sleek textures and high contrasts, just like the city we adore.  Soft purrs and gentle headbutts, Shaomaomi and Tuxedo.
