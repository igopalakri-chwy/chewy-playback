Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4093877
============================================================

Hello, Human! It's us, Tuxedo and Shaomaomi. We've had a pawsome time trying all these new foods you've been getting us. That beef and liver dish was purr-fect and those tiny chicken and turkey pates are a hit! We also loved the soft and appetizing chicken pate. The grain-free trout and catfish pate makes us clean our plates every time! As for that finger toothbrush, nice try, but we are way too smart for that. We hope you keep surprising us with these delicious meals. Purrs and head bumps, Tuxedo and Shaomaomi
