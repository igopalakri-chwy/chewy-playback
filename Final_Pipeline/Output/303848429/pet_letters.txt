Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 303848429
============================================================

Dear Human,

Hope you're doing well. We're having a ball of a time here. The vegetarian dry food you've been getting us is simply delicious. We can't help but wag our tail in joy every time we see you with it. And those tablets, they're quite the lifesaver. They make us feel so much better and we're back to our playful selves in no time. Oh, and how can we forget the toys! The floppy knots are our favorite. We could play with them all day. The dog bandana is quite the fashion statement. We've been strutting around flaunting it to everyone.

With all our wagging tails and playful barks,
Hooper
