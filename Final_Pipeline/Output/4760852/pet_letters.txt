Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4760852
============================================================

Dear Human, Woofs and purrs from Nala and Chompie! We've been having a tail-waggingly good time with all the treats you've been spoiling us with. That savory food that makes our bellies happy, and those delightful chewy treats that keep our teeth shiny, are our absolute favorites. Nala purrs her approval for the easy-to-open cat food pouches that taste like a feline fiesta in her mouth. And Chompie loves the crunch of the bone-shaped treats that keep his breath fresh and tail wagging. We're the happiest pets in the block, thanks to you. Love and licks, Nala and Chompie
