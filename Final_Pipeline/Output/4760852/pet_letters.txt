Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4760852
============================================================

Hello Human! This is Chompie and Nala, your loyal and playful pets. Just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how much we appreciate the tasty meals you've been serving up. Chompie here, I've been having zoomies of happiness after my meals. That deliciously moist and meaty food, oh it makes my tail wag! And Nala, well she's been purring like never before after her meals. The tender chunks of meat in her food, it's just perfectly delectable. We've also been enjoying the dental treats that freshen our breath and the joint supplements that keep us nimble. Thank you for keeping us healthy and happy. With love and wagging tails, Chompie and Nala.
