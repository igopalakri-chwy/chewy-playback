Imagine a cozy living room with a joyous Cockapoo named Chompie and a mysterious cat named Nala. Chompie, with his wagging tail, is enjoying his scrumptious meal from a Chewy-branded bowl filled with small chunks of dog food in gravy. Nala, gracefully seated by a Chewy-branded food pouch, is happily devouring her chicken and turkey pate. In the corner, a Chewy-branded cat litter box filled with fresh-smelling cat litter is neatly placed. The room is filled with warmth, love, and the subtle branding of Chewy.
