Picture a warm, cozy living room bathed in the soft glow of afternoon sunlight. Nala, the unknown breed cat, is lounging on a plush cat tower, licking her paws after a satisfying meal of chicken slices in gravy. Nearby, the small Cockapoo, Chompie, is gnawing happily on a dental chew treat, tail wagging energetically. In the corner is a Chewy-branded toy bin filled with colorful toys, and a food bowl with the Chewy logo is placed next to a fresh-scented litter box.
