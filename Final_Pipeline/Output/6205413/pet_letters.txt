Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6205413
============================================================

Dear Human,

Thank you for all the goodies! We just can't resist the exotic taste of our freeze-dried rabbit nuggets. It makes meal times an adventure. And oh, those salmon and quail pates, they are simply purrfect, especially for our toothless warriors who prefer their food smooth and full of flavor. The dangling egg toy is a blast too. We love how the stringy legs dance in the air. It's so much fun! Just a friendly meow-out, remember we're not too fond of restrictions - free spirits, you know! So, keep the soft recovery collars coming - they're so much more comfortable.

With purrs and paw-taps,
Primal, Cocoabean, Fancy, Savory, Luna, Beyond, and Purrfect
