Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6205413
============================================================

Hello hooman! This is Cocoabean, Luna, Beyond, Primal, Purrfect, Savory, and Fancy, the feisty feline squad of your home. We want to share our joy with you. We're doing the happy dance, and Luna is even swishing her tail in delight! We absolutely love the soft and tasty natural treats. They have made our medicine time a delightful event. We are also thrilled about the comb that gently frees us of loose fur. It's purr-fect! And, the creamy chicken food? Yum! It's so easy for us to eat, and we always lick our plates clean. Lastly, we're having so much fun with the dangly egg buddy toy. It's our new favorite thing to bat around and chase. So, thank you for making our days filled with joy, comfort, and deliciousness! Purrs and headbutts, Cocoabean, Luna, Beyond, Primal, Purrfect, Savory, and Fancy.
