Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6084516
============================================================

Dear Human, Paws in the air, it's Buddy and Sam, your feline friends! We've been having a purr-fectly good time enjoying our favorite treats and toys. That tasty chicken and rice food is definitely our jam. We feel healthier and more energetic than ever! And those catnip-filled paper bags, oh, they're the best thing since sliced bread. We love the fun and games, and even though we're a bit picky, we appreciate all the choices. Our ears are doing better too, thanks to that fast-acting ear mite medication. Keep up the good work! Love and purrs, Buddy and Sam
