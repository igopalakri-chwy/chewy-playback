Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6084516
============================================================

Dear hooman, we're your fur-balls, Sam and Buddy! We're writing to express our sheer delight at the delicious meals and treats you've been serving us. We're absolutely in love with that scrumptious chicken and rice recipe and the grain-free turkey and chicken feast. They've added a spring to our step and the energy to chase our own tails! We also can't get enough of that irresistible catnip blend, it sends us straight to kitty heaven! The ear mite medication was a real lifesaver, no more scratching for us. We also adore those crinkly paper bags, the best cheap thrills ever! As picky eaters, not all treats are to our taste, but those jumbo chicken flavored crunchy treats are a hit! Just remember, Sam doesn't care much for those salmon treats. Purr-haps it's just a cat thing. Anyway, we're off to nap now! Your kitties, Sam and Buddy
