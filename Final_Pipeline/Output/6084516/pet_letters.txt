Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6084516
============================================================

Hello there! It's your favorite duo, Sam and Buddy, writing to you from our comfy cat tower. We've been having so much fun with our interactive catnip blend, it really gets our whiskers twitching! Not to mention the tasty chicken and brown rice food that keeps our bellies full and our tails high. Oh, and those medicine for ear mites - they've been a real game-changer. No more itchy ears - it's just purr-fect. And don't even get us started on the grain-free turkey and chicken food - it's been making us feel so energetic and lively. And those paper bags infused with catnip, oh they're just the best cheap entertainment we could ask for! Although, we have to admit, we're a bit of a picky eater when it comes to salmon treats, Buddy loves them but Sam, not so much. It's a cat thing, you know. Well, that's all for now, it's time for our afternoon nap. Paw-five from us!
