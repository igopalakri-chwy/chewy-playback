Picture this: A cozy living room, bathed in the warm glow of a lamp. In the center, Buddy and Sam, a pair of American Shorthair cats, are playfully tussling over a Chewy-branded, catnip-filled paper bag. Beside them, a bag of chicken and rice cat food and a box of ear mite medication, both with a subtle Chewy logo. Buddy, mid-leap, is in the air above Sam, who's peeking out of the paper bag, eyes glistening with mischief. They are the epitome of health and energy, their coats sleek and shiny, a testament to their well-chosen diet.
