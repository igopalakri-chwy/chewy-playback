Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5812
============================================================

Hello Human, it's your fur-buddies, Denali and Gunner! Tail wags galore from our end. We can't stop bouncing around with joy because of our new chewy flying toys and squeaky pig plushie. They are the absolute best! We've been having the zoomies all day. The soft puppy starter kit is snug as a bug, perfect for our after-play snoozes. And oh, the Star Wars tanks? Pawsome! We look forward to more of these. Snuggle squad, signing off with a woof and a wag. Love, Denali and Gunner.
