Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5812
============================================================

Woof Woof! This is Denali and Gunner, your playful and curious Boxer duo reporting in! Boy, do we love playtime. Our tails wag at the sight of those chewy little bug toys - zipping, zooming and play-bowing around them is the highlight of our day. Gunner can't resist getting his paws on the squeaky plush pig toy - it's squeals of joy all around! We've also had the chance to prance around in some super cool Star Wars tanks - talk about style and comfort! And guess what, we've been getting some extra cuddles thanks to the cozy puppy starter kit. We love the playtime, the snuggles, and all the fun we have together. From: Denali and Gunner
