Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5812
============================================================

Hello Human! This is your favorite tail wagging duo, Denali and Gunner, reporting in! We've been having a blast recently, especially with that squeaky purple bug toy you got us. We can't get enough of it! And those Star Wars-themed tanks? They make us feel like we're part of the galactic bark side. Thanks for always thinking of us and making our days full of zoomies and tail wags. Wags and licks, Denali and Gunner!
