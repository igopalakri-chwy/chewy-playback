Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5812
============================================================

Hey hooman, it's your favorite pups Denali and Gunner! We've been having a blast with the purple bug-like toys and soft pig plushie you've got us from Chewy. We can't resist a good squeak and chase around the house! We've also been enjoying the Yoda and Darth Vader tanks. We feel like intergalactic heroes! That puppy starter kit you got for us when we were younger, we still remember it fondly. It made us feel so loved and comfortable. And oh, the shampoo! It leaves our fur looking shiny and feeling super soft. Love and tail wags, Denali and Gunner
