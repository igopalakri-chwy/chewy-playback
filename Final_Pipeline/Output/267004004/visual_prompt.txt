Imagine a scene with two curious cats of unspecified breed, one weighing 11 pounds and the other 10. They're both around 3 years old and have an air of playfulness and affection. The cats are enjoying a sunny day in a modern suburban room, filled with vibrant greens, sky blues, brick reds, and concrete grays. In this contemporary art scene, one cat is playfully batting at a red and purple feather wand while the other is stretching and scratching on a tall, dark charcoal cat tree. Beside them is a stainless steel cat fountain and a bin labeled 'Chewy' filled with an array of colorful spring toys. In the background, a subtle hint of Bellevue skyline, Lake Washington, Mount Rainier, and evergreen trees can be seen through a large window, adding a touch of nature to the scene.
