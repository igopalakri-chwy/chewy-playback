Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 267004004
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you in the midst of a cozy catnap or chasing a laser pointer. We've been having such a ball lately with our new feather wand toy, it's like a bird in the house but without the mess! And let's not forget our new scratching post, it's purr-fect for our playful and curious nature. But it's not all play, we do enjoy our downtime too. Nothing beats curling up together after a hearty meal of our favorite chicken pate and roasted chicken & rice medley. It's like a tiny tiger's feast in a can! And we can't forget to mention the joy of a fresh litter box, thanks to our clumping clay cat litter. It's the little things, you know?

With purrs and headbutts,
Eugene and Alice
