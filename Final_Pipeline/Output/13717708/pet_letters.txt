Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 13717708
============================================================

Dear Human,

We, your faithful companions, felt the need to express our gratitude for the love and care you shower upon us. We can't help but wag our tails with excitement every time we see that bag of bison, lentil, and carrot recipe dry food. It's truly lip-smacking! The peanut butter and oats training treats are a real delight to our taste buds and motivate us to learn new tricks. We also appreciate the pumpkin digestive aid supplement. It helps keep our tummies happy and healthy. And oh, those yogurt, strawberry, blueberry, banana, and peanut butter dental treats are not just good for our teeth, but they taste heavenly too. We also love the calming soft chews you give us. They help us stay calm and composed. We hope you continue to treat us with these delightful goodies.

With all our love and zoomies,
Mimi, Benny, and Louis
