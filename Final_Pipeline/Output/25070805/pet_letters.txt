Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 25070805
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you well. We've been enjoying our days, filled with fun and frolic. We've discovered a newfound love for these twisty chewy sticks, they keep us entertained for hours! The different flavors are a bonus - chicken, beef, and salmon, oh my! They're so yummy, we can't resist them. We also love our meals topped with the delicious food shreds you've been getting us. They've turned mealtime into a culinary adventure! And when we're ready for a snooze, there's nothing like curling up in our pineapple-shaped bed. It's the perfect blend of cozy and stylish, just like us!

With wagging tails and bright eyes,
Milo and Guinness
