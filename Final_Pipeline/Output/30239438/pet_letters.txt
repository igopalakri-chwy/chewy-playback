============================================================

Dear Human,

Oh, what a delight it is being a Yorkshire Terrier pup like me, Fitz! Every day is a new adventure filled with play and exploration. My favorite part of the day? Definitely when I get to nibble on those yummy soft-moist training treats. The beef, chicken, salmon variations, oh they're all so scrumptious! I also enjoy the challenge of getting treats out of those interactive puzzle toys - they keep me entertained for hours. Speaking of hours, I love spending time in my cozy donut cuddler bed after a long day of play. It's so soft and snuggly, the perfect spot for some well-deserved snoozing. And who could forget bath time? The vanilla almond shampoo and conditioner make my fur soft and shiny, and I smell so good afterwards!

With wagging tails and playful paws,
Fitz
