Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Zoomie greetings, human! This is Francis and Moe, your adventure-loving fur babies! We've had tail wagging fun and purr-worthy moments with some really cool stuff you got us. We absolutely love our artfully patterned bowls - they're just paw-fect for our meal times. And those small, red nail caps are a treat - they make us feel so stylish while keeping our nails in check. Oh, and that dual charger for our training collars is quite useful, it keeps us on our best behavior. Here's to more playtimes and snuggles! Yours in paws and tail wags, Francis and Moe
