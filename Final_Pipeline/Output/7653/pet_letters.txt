Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hey there human! It's your furry friends, Francis and Moe, writing to you. We just wanted to say thank you for all those stylish sand-colored bowls you've been getting us. They're paw-some! We love the way our food tastes in them, and we've been having a blast playing with the soft claw caps. We feel so stylish! And oh, that training collar is really helping Moe become a good boy. We think we're the luckiest pets in the world to have you. Tail wags and purrs, Francis and Moe.
