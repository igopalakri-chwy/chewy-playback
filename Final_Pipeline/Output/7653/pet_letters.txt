Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hello hooman, this is Francis and Moe! We just wanted to let you know how much we enjoy the bone-patterned bowls you got for us from Chewy. We feel like royalty every time we eat or drink from them! Moe, being an adventurous little pup, loves his bright yellow life jacket. He says it makes him feel like a superhero. As for me, Francis, I can't get enough of the red nail caps. Who knew safety could be so stylish? Okay, time for us to go chase our tails. Love and purrs, Francis and Moe.
