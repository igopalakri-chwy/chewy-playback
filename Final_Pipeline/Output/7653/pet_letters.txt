Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hello there human! It's us, Francis and Moe, your playful and affectionate pets! We've been having the time of our lives playing with our new colorful toys. We've been sipping water from the artistic bone-patterned bowls you got us. They're just the right size for us to dip our whiskers and noses in. And let us tell you, nothing beats the comfort of our snuggly bed after a day full of zoomies and exploring. We're sending you purrs and wagging tails of appreciation for making our lives so pawsome!
