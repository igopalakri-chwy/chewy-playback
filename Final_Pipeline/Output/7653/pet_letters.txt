Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hello hooman! We, Francis and Moe are here to tell you about our favorite things! Our playful and curious nature keeps us busy. We love to have our meals from our patterned earthenware bowls. They're just the right size for us and have a fun bone design that we find amusing! We've also noticed those vibrant nail caps you got for us. They make us feel so stylish! Lastly, the comfy urn you got has become our favorite spot to hang out and daydream about chasing squirrels and birds. Woofs and purrs, Francis and Moe
