Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hey there hooman! It's Francis and Moe, your best fur buddies. We wanted to tell you that we absolutely love the new colorful food bowls you got us. Those bowls make dinner time so much more fun! And oh, the nail caps for Francis, they're just purrfect! We also enjoy the snugly urn. It's like our secret hideout. We love you more than treats! Lots of tail wags and purrs, Francis and Moe!
