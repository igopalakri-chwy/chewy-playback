Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Dear Human, 

What an adventure life is with you! We, Francis and Moe, are having the zoomies of joy, just thinking about the sandy bone patterned bowls you always fill with delicious food for us. We can't help but wag our tails and purr in delight every time we see them. Oh, and the heart-shaped urns - they're a curious sight for us. And don't even get us started on the vibrant red nail caps and the training collar! They've surely made our days more interesting. 

With warm wagging tails and purring hearts, 
Francis and Moe
