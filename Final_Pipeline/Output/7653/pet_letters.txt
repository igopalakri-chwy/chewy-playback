Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hello Human, 

It's us, Francis and Moe! We have been having the zoomies of joy with the fun stuff you get us from Chewy. Oh boy, do we love the sandy-colored bowls with funky bone designs. They are perfect for our favorite meals and the occasional water play. We've also noticed the red nail caps you got for us. They're quite stylish, and we feel like superheroes with them on! Also, we've been eyeing that bright yellow life jacket. We're ready for any adventure that comes our way! 

We hope you are as excited as we are for more playtimes and cuddles. With lots of tail wags and purrs, 

Francis and Moe
