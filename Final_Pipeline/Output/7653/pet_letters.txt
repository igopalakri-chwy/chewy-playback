Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Hey there, human! It's Francis and Moe, your favorite feline and canine duo. We're having a blast with the scent of the long-lasting, freshness-scented clumping clay litter. It's like a breath of fresh air! We also can't get enough of the soft and crunchy chicken flavor treats. It really sends our taste buds on an adventure! And we mustn't forget the stylish breakaway collars. They're the perfect accessory for us, don't you think? We're just two playful, curious, and affectionate friends living our best lives. Thanks for making it all possible! Yours in purrs and woofs, Francis and Moe
