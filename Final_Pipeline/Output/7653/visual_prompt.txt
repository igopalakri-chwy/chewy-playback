The artwork features two pets: one cat and one dog. The cat is an 11-year-old, 10-pound breed unknown, with a playful and curious expression. The dog, an 8-year-old mix, weighing 11 pounds, displays an affectionate and playful demeanor. They are both in a rustic setting, reflecting earthy tones with rough textures, inspired by folk and indigenous art. The pets are surrounded by lush green fields, with bits of historic architecture peeping from the back. They are both seen playfully engaging with a pile of soft & crunchy treats, their eyes gleaming with delight. The Chewy logo is subtly incorporated on the treat bag.
