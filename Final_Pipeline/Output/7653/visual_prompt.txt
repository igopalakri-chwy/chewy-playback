Imagine a cozy living room bathed in warm light. Francis, an active and curious cat, and Moe, an equally energetic and curious dog, are in the centre, playing around artfully patterned bowls from Chewy. Red nail caps, clearly a favorite of the pets, lie scattered around. In the corner, a dual charger for dog training collars sits plugged in. The scene is one of happiness, activity, and togetherness, subtly showcasing the Chewy branding on the items.
