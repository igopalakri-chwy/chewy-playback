Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 935301369
============================================================

Dear Favorite Human,

We hope this letter finds you with a wagging tail and a purring heart! We've been having a lot of fun with some of our favorite things recently. Sirius loves the poultry-flavored dry food; the moment the bag crinkles, he spins in the happiest tail-wagging dance! And speaking of dances, how can we forget our new favorite pastime? Yin and Yang absolutely adore their seafood feast, and the sight of the can sends them into a feline ballet of joy. We've also been keeping our teeth sparkling clean with our dental kits. Yin and Yang especially enjoy the malt-flavored one. And we can't forget the joy of playtime. You should see Sirius with his floppy elephant toy; it's a sight to behold! With love and zoomies,

From: Sirius, Yin, and Yang
