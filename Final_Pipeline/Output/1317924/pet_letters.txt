Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hello hooman! It's your fur family Sindel, Beatrix Kiddo, German, Wet, Bff, and Gsd here. We just wanted to say how much we appreciate the delicious and chunky wet food you've been getting us lately. Sindel can't get enough of the apple and ginger flavor treats! They give her the zoomies every time. And don't even get us started on the meaty bones, it's playtime and snack time all in one, purrfect! We love how they keep Sindel occupied when you're away. Meanwhile, us cats are loving the variety packs, they make meal times so exciting, although we could do with a few more chunks of meat. Beatrix Kiddo particularly enjoys the pick and mix approach. The clumping clay cat litter is also top-notch, it keeps our bathroom area fresh and clean. Thank you for taking such good care of us, we feel very loved. Until next time, lots of purrs and wagging tails, Sindel, Beatrix Kiddo, German, Wet, Bff, and Gsd.
