Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Woof, Meow! It's Sindel and Beatrix Kiddo writing in. We just wanted to tell you how much we enjoy the simple things in life. Sindel loves her necessary supplements that keep her as spry as a young pup, while Beatrix can't get enough of her delicious dry cat food. And don't even get us started on the joy we feel when we see a fresh bag of unscented bags. You should see our tails wag and hear our purrs of delight! We're just two old pals, savoring our golden years with some of our favorite things. Stay pawsome!
