Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you in the best of spirits. We've been having quite the time here, full of zoomies and play! The tasty dry food you got last time, it's the best! Sindel, with her senior charm, has been enjoying her meals more than ever. And Beatrix Kiddo, our feline queen, can't get enough of it either. We've also noticed the supplement you've been adding to Sindel's meals. It's been great and she's been more active than ever, still a healthy pup at heart!

The unscented bags you've been getting are a relief for our sensitive noses. We appreciate that you've been keeping our space clean and odor-free. We're both looking forward to the next package of tasty food and treats.

With all our love and zoomies,

Sindel and Beatrix Kiddo
