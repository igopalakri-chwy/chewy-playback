Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hello there hooman, this is your furry family reporting in with purrs and wagging tails! We've been having a feast with the tasty wet food and the chunky meat pieces you've been getting us. It's like having a gourmet meal every day! And those chewy treats? They're the highlight of our day! Beatrix still prefers her food in a certain way (you know how picky she can be), but even she can't resist these treats. And Sindel, oh she loves playing with her treats before gobbling them up. Our litter box is always fresh thanks to the clumping clay you got us. It makes our personal space smell nice and clean. We are all about that Pacific Northwest Modern vibe you've brought into our home and it's making our days more adventurous and energetic. With love, German, Gsd, Sindel, Wet, Beatrix Kiddo and Bff.
