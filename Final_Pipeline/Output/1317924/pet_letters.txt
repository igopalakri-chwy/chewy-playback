Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Woof and Meow there, beloved hooman! We, your furry companions Sindel and Beatrix Kiddo, are wagging our tails with joy! The unscented bags you get for us are just right, they help keep our space clean and fresh. Oh, and the dry food? We absolutely love it! Sindel's been feeling like a puppy again with the food that has actual ingredients. It's perfect for her senior needs. And Beatrix, the diva that she is, appreciates the trusted brand you choose for her meals. We're both purring and howling with happiness over here. Stay pawsome! Love, Sindel and Beatrix Kiddo
