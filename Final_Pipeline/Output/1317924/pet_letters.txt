Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Dear Human, meow and woof! We're having a pawsome time here at home. Sindel, Bff, Gsd, Wet, German, and Beatrix Kiddo are all sending you purrs and waggy tails. We've been feasting on chunky, meaty wet food that makes our tummies purr. Sindel also loves her crunchy apple and ginger treats, and she gets so excited over her jerky bone - it's the best game before a tasty chew! Our litter box is fresh, and we appreciate the low dust. We've been behaving our best, just like you've taught us. We're looking forward to more days filled with yummy meals and playtime. Purrhaps, more of those variety packs could find their way home? From: Sindel, Bff, Gsd, Wet, German, and Beatrix Kiddo.
