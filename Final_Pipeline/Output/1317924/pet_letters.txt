Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hey there hooman! Your fur-family here, Sindel, Beatrix Kiddo, Wet, German, Gsd, and Bff. We're having quite the party here! We're all about those chunky and delicious wet food that you've been getting us. Sindel especially loves that food that comes with chunks of meat and veggies, even though it's not her absolute favorite. It's a party every time we get a taste of that apple and ginger flavored treat! And guess what? Those jerky bone treats you leave us when you're away? We play with them before we actually start chewing - it's like a fun game! And of course, we love our litter box - it's neat, dust-free, and does a great job masking our business. So, thank you! We're looking forward to more yummy food and fun treats. Love and purrs, Sindel, Beatrix Kiddo, Wet, German, Gsd, and Bff.
