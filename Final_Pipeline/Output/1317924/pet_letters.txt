Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Human,

We’ve been paws-deep in family meetings and have a few things to share with you. Beatrix Kiddo here, the team leader (naturally). As the discerning connoisseur of our group, I’ve organized our favorites around the house—like that special TuffRider shirt and GloFish plant that adds a vibrant touch to our little kingdom.

Bff, Wet, and German are our wet food aficionados. They ensure not a morsel is left behind, and our Frisco cat tree has become their favorite meeting spot. Let’s just say they keep our shared living space odor-free, thanks to that Stink Free jar you wisely provided.

Sindel, our canine sister, adds rhythm to our lives, turning treat time into a playful dance. Her taste in Wet Noses treats is impeccable, and she’s a master of solo dining—yet always a loving presence.

Gsd, the youngest of our troop, has made that TuffRider shirt a family favorite, too. Her knack for finding joy in the simplest things reminds us all to savor every moment (and snack).

The rest of the gang help us keep things lively and love-filled. Together, we all agree that life with you is a delightful adventure filled with love, belly rubs, and a plentiful supply of grain-free delicacies.

Thank you for being our world. We adore you.

With love,  
Beatrix Kiddo, Bff, Wet, Sindel, German, Gsd, and the rest of the family 💖🐾
