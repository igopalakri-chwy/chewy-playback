Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hello hooman, it's your furry family reporting in! We've been having a blast with all the goodies you've been bringing home. That meaty wet food you got? Purrfect. It's not too liquid-y and the chunks of meat are simply de-lish. And oh boy, those apple and ginger flavored treats are like a mini feast for us. We are wagging our tails and purring with delight! And the unscented clay litter? It's safe, comfy, and clumps well (not that we mind, but you seem to appreciate it!). We're loving the variety of food packs too. It's like a surprise box each day. We've noticed you've been bringing home more modern and minimal stuff lately. We approve, it matches our fur! Keep up the good work, hooman. Love, Sindel, German, Gsd, Wet, Beatrix Kiddo, and Bff.
