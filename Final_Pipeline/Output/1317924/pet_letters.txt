Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hello there, human! It's your furry friends, German, Beatrix Kiddo, Sindel, Bff, Wet, and Gsd here. We've been up to our usual shenanigans - exploring, playing, and, of course, eating! We absolutely love that chunky seafood delight you've been giving us. It's purr-fectly delicious and not too liquid-y, just the way we like it! And oh, those grain-free treats with apple and ginger flavor? They're the cat's whiskers! Sindel can't get enough of them. She's even known to play with them before gobbling them up. Those jerky bone rawhide treats are quite the distraction too, especially when you're away. Sindel loves to play with them before chewing. We've also noticed that the litter in our boxes clumps much better now, making our 'business' time much more pleasant. Thanks for taking care of us and keeping our tummies happy. We promise to repay you with lots of snuggles and purrs! Love, German, Beatrix Kiddo, Sindel, Bff, Wet, and Gsd.
