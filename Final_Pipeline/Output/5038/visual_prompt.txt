Picture this: a cozy living room with Chewy's branded turquoise and orange colors subtly woven into the scene. From a plush rug to a trendy throw blanket on the couch, the branding is tastefully done. In the middle of the room, Mike, a playful Domestic cat, is swatting at a lint roller, his green eyes sparkling with curiosity. His fur is immaculately groomed, hinting at a recent trim. Nearby, Myles, an energetic medium-sized Australian Shepherd, is gleefully gnawing on a hippo-shaped treat dispenser, his tail wagging wildly. Empty bags of turkey jerky and peanut butter treats are scattered around, signs of a joyful feast.
