Imagine a warm, sunlit living room, with Mike, the playful Domestic cat with a mysterious age, and Myles, the curious Australian Shepherd pup, both engrossed in their Chewy goodies. Mike is batting around a lint roller refill, his green eyes gleaming with excitement. Myles, on the other hand, is happily gnawing on a durable hippo-shaped treat dispenser. The Chewy logo is subtly present on their food bowls filled with grain-free turkey jerky and peanut butter flavored treats.
