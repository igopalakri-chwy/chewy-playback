============================================================

Imagine a playful scene unfolding in a warm, homely setting. At the center, a Domestic cat, Mike, and an Australian Shepherd dog, Myles, are engaged in a playful banter. Mike is swatting playfully at a treat dispenser shaped like a hippo, the Chewy logo subtly visible on its side. Myles is nearby, tail wagging in anticipation, ready to pounce. Discarded around them are empty packets of turkey jerky bites and peanut butter flavor treats, clear favorites. A Chewy-branded lint roller sits on a side table, evidence of their recent shenanigans. The scene is cozy, fun, and full of life, a testament to the joyful personalities of Mike and Myles.
