Imagine a playful scene with Mike, a Domestic cat, and Myles, an Australian Shepherd. They are frolicking around a room filled with Chewy-branded items. Myles is energetically bouncing around with a hippo-shaped treat dispenser in his mouth, while Mike is contentedly nibbling on turkey jerky treats. A Chewy-branded blue trimmer sits on a nearby table, waiting for its next grooming session. Scattered around are empty packets of peanut butter flavored pill pouches, a testament to the pets' love for these treats.
