Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Dear Human, Woofs and meows from us, Mike and Myles! We've been having a tail-wagging good time here, especially when we're munching on those juicy turkey jerky bites and peanut butter flavor treats you keep getting us. Yum, they make our whiskers twitch and tails wag faster than a squirrel on a tree! Oh, and that treat dispenser shaped like a hippo? We've been having the zoomies all day trying to get it to spill out more goodies. It's paw-sitively the best! And when we're done, we love to help you clean up by rolling around in the lint roller refills. We can't quite figure out why you laugh so much when we do that, but hey, anything for a giggle, right? So, that's our update! Keep the treats coming! Woofs, purrs, and belly rubs please! From: Mike and Myles
