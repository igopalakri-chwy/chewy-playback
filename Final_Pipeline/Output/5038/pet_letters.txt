Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello Hooman! It's Mike and Myles here, your furry best friends. We must say, we really enjoy the yummy turkey jerky bites and peanut butter pouches you keep ordering. They make our tails wag with joy and our taste buds do a happy dance! Oh, and the fun hippo dispenser toy is just pawsome. We spend hours playing with it, it's the best game of chase and fetch. We often find ourselves dozing off on it after a good play session. Oh, and thanks for caring about our health with those skin care treatments and de-wormers. We might not show it, but we appreciate it. Love, Mike and Myles.
