Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this message finds you in high spirits. We've been having a blast with our new toys. Monty can't stop playing with his soft plush toy and I've been enjoying my crunchy treats. We can't wait for our next surprise!

With all our love and purrs,
Mike and Monty
