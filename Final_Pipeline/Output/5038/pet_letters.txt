Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello Human! It's us, Mike and Myles, your playful and curious crew. We have been having a blast with the chewy treats and the funky hippo toy you got us. These peanut butter treat pouches? Pawsome! And the jerky bites are worth doing zoomies for. Oh, and we love that lint roller - keeps our fur looking neat and shiny. We're so lucky to live in this warm, friendly home with you. We love you even more than we love chasing our tails! Love, Mike and Myles
