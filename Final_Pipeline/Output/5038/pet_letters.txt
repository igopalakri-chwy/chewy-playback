Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello hooman, it's your fur babies, Mike and Myles here! We're having a tail-wagging good time. Myles has been zooming around with that hippo-shaped treat dispenser. He loves it so much he sometimes forgets to let me play! I've been enjoying those delicious turkey jerky treats and the peanut butter flavored pill pouches. They are so tasty, we can't get enough. Also, Myles insists on being groomed with the blue trimmer. He feels like a superstar afterwards. Can't wait for more fun times! Love, Mike and Myles
