Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello Human! We are Mike, the playful Domestic cat, and Myles, the affectionate Australian Shepherd. We want to tell you how much joy your choices bring to us. We absolutely love the peanut butter flavored treats. They're scrumptious! And the turkey jerky treats? They send us into zoomies of joy! The toy hippo is so much fun to play with, it's our favorite game! Also, the big soft brush you use on us, it feels so good. We love our play and pamper time with you. So, keep those treats and toys coming! With love and purrs, Mike and Myles.
