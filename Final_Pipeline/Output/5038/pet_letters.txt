Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you well. We've been enjoying our time at home, especially when we get to savor our favorite turkey, rice, and venison recipe, which is so delectable! Speaking of delectable, those chicken flavor treats are simply irresistible. We've been having a blast with the squeaky toys too, they're so much fun to play with! The self-warming bed is perfect for our snuggle sessions and we absolutely love the soft, cozy feel of it. We also appreciate the health monitoring litter, it's comforting to know you're looking out for us.

With purrs and wagging tails,
Mike and Monty
