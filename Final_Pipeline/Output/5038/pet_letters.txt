Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello Human! It's Mike and Myles, your favorite furballs! We've been having a tail-wagging time with all the goodies you've been getting us! Myles can't get enough of those savory turkey jerky bites, he's always sniffing around for more. And those peanut butter treats? Purr-fection! I (Mike) have been trying to steal some. Don't tell Myles! We've also noticed the new toys - those hippo-shaped treat dispensers are so much fun to play with! We do enjoy our playtime, don't we? Anyway, thanks for all the love and fun times. Sending you a million purrs and wagging tails! Love, Mike and Myles
