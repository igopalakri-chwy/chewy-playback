Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello there, your favorite duo Mike and Myles reporting in! We've been having a blast with the peanut butter-flavored treat pouches you got for us. They're as fun to play with as they are to eat, plus they make our tails wag every single time! And don't even get us started on the turkey jerky bites. They're the bee's knees! Also, we've been taking turns playing with the hippo-shaped treat dispenser. It's our new favorite pastime. We're feeling so loved and pampered in our bustling, modern home. Thanks for being the best pet parent ever! Much love and wagging tails, Mike and Myles
