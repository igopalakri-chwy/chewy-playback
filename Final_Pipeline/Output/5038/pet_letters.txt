Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you in good spirits! We've been meaning to tell you how much joy your thoughtful selections bring to our lives. We both go bonkers over the crunchy dry food (surf and turf for Mike, salmon and sweet potato for Monty), and the health-monitoring litter is a hit with Mike. Monty can't get enough of his squeaky alligator toy, and Mike simply adores his cactus scratching post. The tuna treats? Superb! Oh, and we can't forget that charming unicorn tent - it's just the best for napping after a long day of play and exploration.

The world is our playground, and we are ever so curious. We just can't help it! With belly rubs and wagging tails, we remain,

Your loving pets,
Monty and Mike
