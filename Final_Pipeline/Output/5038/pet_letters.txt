Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello there, hooman! It's your playful pals, Mike and Myles, reporting from the land of zoomies and snuggles! We've been having the time of our nine lives (and dog lives) with the yummy peanut butter flavor treats and tasty turkey jerky bites you've been getting us. Oh, and that fun hippo treat dispenser toy? It's an absolute riot! We're absolutely loving this rustic, earthy vibe in our home, it feels so authentic and cozy. Sending you purrs, wagging tails, and lots of love, Mike and Myles.
