Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello there! It's your playful pals - Mike and Myles here, having the time of our lives! We are all about the fun and games, and boy do we love our chewy toys! The peanut butter flavored treats make our tails wag with delight and we can't get enough of those delicious turkey jerky bites. They're the paw-fect reward for our zoomy play sessions. Mike loves to keep things neat with the lint roller refills - he's quite the dapper kitty! And Myles, well, he's quite the fan of the treat dispenser toy. It's like a game and a treat all in one! We love the rustic vibes of our home, it makes our playtime feel so authentic and real. And guess what, it's time for another round of chase! Catch you later, human!
