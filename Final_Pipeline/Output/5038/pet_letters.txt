Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hello there, zoomies of joy! It's Monty and Mike, your playful, curious, and affectionately silly pets! We're writing to let you know how much we love the crunchy dry food and health-monitoring litter you provide us. Monty is all wags and wiggles when he gets his grain-free salmon & sweet potato recipe, and Mike purrs like a motor when he digs into his surfin' & turfin' favorites. The health-monitoring litter is also a hit - Mike thinks it's the best spot to do his business! We're pawsitively thrilled with everything you provide - from our fun toys to our yummy treats. Thanks for making our tails wag and our hearts full. Love, Monty and Mike
