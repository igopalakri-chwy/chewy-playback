Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5038
============================================================

Hey there human! This is Mike and Myles, your playful and food-motivated duo, zooming in with wagging tails and purrs of joy. You know how much we adore that crunchy jerky you get us from Chewy? It really makes our tails wag with excitement! And those peanut butter pill pouches - yum! We can't get enough of them. Oh, and the funny hippo that dispenses treats? Best. Toy. Ever. We just wanted to say thanks for making our days filled with fun, food, and frolic. Love, Mike and Myles
