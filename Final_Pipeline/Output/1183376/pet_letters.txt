Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Hello Hooman! We, the three of us, just wanted to tell you how much we love the goodies. The festive light-up sweaters and cozy scarves are purrfect for our fashion show. We also adore the twisty toy and robot mouse, they keep us on our paws all day long. And of course, the scrumptious food you serve us, especially the grain-free wet food and the toothsome beef & carrots entree, are simply the cat's whiskers! Not to forget, our pill time is now treat time, thanks to those yummy salmon flavor treats. We're feline fine and furry thankful! From: The 3 pets
