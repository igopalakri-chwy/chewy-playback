Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Hello hooman! Fur-squad reporting in! Turbo and Elwood here, and our anonymous friend! We've been having a blast with our new toys and clothes. Elwood and I have been loving our festive light-up sweaters and the twisty toy is a big hit, even with our shy friend. And oh, the food! We've been feasting on some delicious meals that taste just like human food! We've also been trying out this new food to keep our teeth strong and shiny. We're feeling the warm, friendly vibes here and we're loving it! Thanks for making our lives so joyous. From: Turbo, Elwood, and the anonymous one.
