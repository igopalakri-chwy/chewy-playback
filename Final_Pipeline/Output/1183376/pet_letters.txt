Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Dear Human, 

Zoomies of joy from us kitties! We're loving the cozy and festive light-up sweaters and the scarf sweaters you gifted us. They are purrfect for us, warm and snuggly! We also can't resist the twisted toy, it's our favorite playtime buddy. The food? Absolutely fur-licious! We're especially fond of the grain-free variety and the one that's supposed to be good for our teeth. Oh, and the robotic mouse? Best.game.ever. It's like chasing a real mouse, only better. And the scratcher toy? It's the catnip! Thank you for these wonderful treats. 

Stay pawsome! 

Signed, 
Elwood, Turbo, and the mysterious third kitty
