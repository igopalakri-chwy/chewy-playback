Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Hello Human! Turbo, Elwood, and our mysterious feline friend here. We've been having a blast in our soft and shiny holiday sweaters, perfect for these chilly days. Oh, and don't get us started on the twisty toy, it's been a riot! We've also been enjoying some yummy food - it's so good, we'd swear it was made for humans! The pill treats have been a hit too, we gobble them down, pill and all. And the mouse toy? Purr-fection. It's just like chasing a real mouse, without all the hassle. We've also been keeping our claws in prime condition on our sturdy scratcher, and keeping our teeth clean with some new kibble. Life's good over here, hope it's the same for you. Love, Turbo, Elwood, and Cat #3!
