Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Dear Human,

We've been having quite the feast with the variety of wet food you've been getting us. Our favorite has to be the one with chunks of real turkey â€” it makes our whiskers twitch in delight! We've also been enjoying the crunchy treats that help keep our teeth clean. Thanks for always taking care of us.

With purrs and headbutts,
Elwood and Roscoe
