Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Hello there, human! This is your feline snuggle squad reporting in. We are having a purr-fect day here. Turbo, Elwood and our mysterious third musketeer, whom you haven't named yet, are all enjoying our new comfy holiday sweaters. They're a perfect fit, and we don't mind wearing them at all. The one with the light-up nose is our favorite - it gives us the zoomies of joy! Oh, and don't even get us started on the twisted kicker toy. It's like catnip for us, and we can't get enough of it. We also love our new mouse toy - it's like having a real mouse to chase around, but without all the mess. The scrumptious food you've been getting us has been a real treat. It's so good, we can't believe it's not human food! And those salmon-flavored treats - they're the cat's meow! We hope you're having just as much fun watching us as we are playing. Love, Turbo, Elwood, and the unnamed one.
