Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Dear Human,

Being the curious Birman cats that we are, we've had a paw-some time exploring the variety of delightful items you've brought into our world. We absolutely adore the oven roasted chicken flavored treats that fill us with joy at every crunch. Not to mention the freeze-dried lamb and chicken bites that make our whiskers twitch with excitement. We can't resist the delicious aroma of turkey entrees in gravy, it's purr-fectly irresistible! We must say, the oral care food you provide is great too, it keeps us feeling healthy and our teeth sparkling clean. We hope to continue this fun-filled journey of culinary exploration with you.

With all our love and purrs,
Elwood and Roscoe
