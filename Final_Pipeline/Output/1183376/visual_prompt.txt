Imagine a warm, homely scene with a Birman cat named Elwood, a Himalayan cat named Turbo and a generic domestic cat. All are delightfully engaged in their activities. Elwood and Turbo are wearing festive light-up sweaters, while the unnamed kitty is having a blast with a twisty toy. A robotic mouse scurries around, evoking playful pounces. A double-wide scratcher toy with catnip rests nearby. The food bowls, filled with grain-free variety and dental care food, bear the subtle branding of Chewy. It's a scene filled with joy, comfort, and the essence of pet companionship.
