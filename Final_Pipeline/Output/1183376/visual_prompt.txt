Two Birman cats are featured in this artistic Chewy-branded scene. The older cat, a 12-year-old, is lounging comfortably, while the younger, 3-year-old cat is playfully batting at a freeze-dried treat. Both cats are medium-sized, weighing around 10 pounds. The setting is rustic chic with warm and natural colors, giving an authentic and homely feel. A picturesque lake and forest provide a serene backdrop. The cats' food and treats are subtly incorporated into the scene, placed in beautifully crafted bowls and containers bearing the Chewy logo.
