Imagine a cozy, festive scene in a warm living room. Turbo, the Himalayan cat, and Elwood, the Birman cat, are proudly wearing their holiday sweaters with LED noses. They are playing with a durable twisted toy and a robotic mouse that scurries around just like a real one. A nearby food bowl, with a subtle Chewy logo, is filled with grain-free cat food. A double-wide cat scratcher, also Chewy-branded, is placed strategically in the corner. A generic domestic cat, our unknown friend, is curiously watching the fun. The room is filled with joy and playfulness as the cats enjoy their Chewy treasures.
