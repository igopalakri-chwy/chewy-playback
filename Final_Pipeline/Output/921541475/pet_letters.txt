Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 921541475
============================================================

Dear Human,

The whole farm gang is here to make your day a little brighter! We've been loving the goodies you've been getting for us. Diggs and Rye can't get enough of the high-protein food, it keeps them bouncing around the yard all day. The goats, Thelma and Louise, have been munching happily on the grain feed. And that birthday cake toy was the star of the recent birthday bash you threw for Pretend Cat; she's been batting it around nonstop. Even the bird and chicken have been joining in the fun. The collar with the hibiscus design is so stylish, we've been taking turns wearing it, even though it's a little big for some of us. Thanks for making our lives a whirlwind of joy and tail-wagging fun.

With all our love and zoomies,
Diggs, Testing Bird, Donkey, Pretend Cat, Testing Chicken, Thelma and Louise, and Rye
