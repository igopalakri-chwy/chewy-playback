The art features seven pets: two dogs, one bird, one horse, one cat, and two farm animals. The dogs, one a generic mixed breed and the other a Labrador Retriever, are playfully chasing a high-protein kibble. A bird, a horse, and a cat, an American Shorthair, are playfully interacting with a birthday cake toy. Two farm animals, both goats, are contently munching on grain feed. The background, inspired by the natural hues of concrete grays and earthy browns, incorporates subtle elements of Pacific Northwest Native American Art. Amidst the greenery, lakes, and mountains, the Chewy branding is subtly incorporated on a toy bin in the scene. The scene is bright and well-lit, emphasizing the joyous energy of the pets.
