Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 282123181
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope you're having a tail-waggingly fantastic day! We are having a blast here, especially when we play with our favorite new toy, a squeaky little ducky. Oh, and the tunnel with a scratching post shaped like a sloth? Pure genius! It's like a secret hideout for us. We also love the glow ball that you got us. It's like a tiny sun that we can chase around the house! Our meal times are a feast, thanks to the delicious freeze-dried dog food. It's like a gourmet meal every day! And let's not forget the lamb dinner patties. They're so scrumptious, we do a little happy dance every time we see the bag. We're also super excited about the eGift Card. Can't wait to see what fun things you'll get us next!

With pawfuls of love and zoomies,
Wanzy
