Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 282123181
============================================================

Dear Human,

We hope this letter finds you well! We've been having so much fun with the new toys you've got for us. The glow ball has been a highlight for me! I love it when it's thrown, and it gives me so much joy to chase after it. It's the perfect size for me, and the glow makes it stand out in any background, making it easy for me to spot. And the plush toys with the squeaky sound? Oh, they're our absolute favorite. They're so soft, and the squeaky sound they make when we bite into them is the best thing ever. The food you've been getting us has been a delight as well. The mackerel and lamb flavor is our favorite. It's so tasty, and we love meal times now more than ever. So, thank you for making our lives so much fun and tasty!

With all our love and zoomies,
Wanzy
