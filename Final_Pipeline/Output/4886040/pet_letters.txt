Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4886040
============================================================

Hello hooman! We just wanted to let you know how much fun we're having with all the delightful goodies you've been getting us. Those bouncy squeaker balls are just the best. Our tails wag uncontrollably when we see them. And the soft and chewy treats? Pawsitively scrumptious! We've also been enjoying the high-grade salmon snacks, they make us feel so spoiled, not to mention the teething stick that keeps us entertained for hours. Just wanted to say a big woof and meow of thanks! Paws and purrs, Sophie, Two, Dewbert, and Acd.
