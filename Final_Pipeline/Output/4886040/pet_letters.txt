Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4886040
============================================================

Human,

We have been meaning to paw-sitively thank you for quite some time. So, here it is ‚Äì a tail-wagging, purr-fect thank you from the four of us.

Firstly, Two here. I want to express my gratitude for those delightful shoe laces you leave around. They are my favorite playground. And thanks for understanding my teething needs and spoiling me with my favorite beef & liver stew. Your kindness makes every treat even more special.

It's Acd's turn now! I can't resist a good play session, those toys you pick out are just the best. Together, we make each moment full of fun and laughter. The snacks you provide show how well you know me, and I feel so loved every day.

Let's not forget Sophie, your ever-energetic German Shepherd. I am still learning the ropes, quite literally, on the lead, but with your patience, I feel like I'm getting better. Those beef liver treats are my favorite; they keep my tail wagging joyously!

And finally, Dewbert here! I simply adore our playtimes, and those snug little corners with my cotton snuggle ring toy. Thank you for indulging my playful spirit and, like my sisters, my teething habits too.

With all the love from me, Two, Acd, Sophie, and Dewbert, and the rest of our furry family, thank you for making our lives pawsome.

With purrs and woofs,
Two, Acd, Sophie, and Dewbert üêæ
