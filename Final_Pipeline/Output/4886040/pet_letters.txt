Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4886040
============================================================

Hello Human, this is your furry gang, Acd, Sophie, Two, and Dewbert, reporting in! We're having a blast in our modern suburban home. Sophie loves the super soft squeaker ball you got us, and Dewbert can't get enough of the delicious salmon snacks. Two and I, Acd, we're quite the spoiled pair, enjoying our quality treats and entertaining toys. We've even been learning some new tricks with those yummy beef liver treats, not to mention the fun we have with the indoor ball. Can't wait for more playtimes and quality snack sessions! Tail wags and purrs, from Acd, Sophie, Two, and Dewbert.
