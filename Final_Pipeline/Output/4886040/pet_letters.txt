Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4886040
============================================================

Hello Hooman! It's your favorite furry friends - Sophie, Acd, Dewbert, and Two. We've been having a pawsome time with the squeaky ball you got us. We can't help but wag our tails and get our zoomies out whenever we see it. Oh, and the stick toy you added a shoelace to? Pure genius! It's the perfect distraction for our teething needs. We can't forget about that salmon-flavored food - it's better than any treat! We feel so spoiled. And that short leash? Great for teaching us not to pull. Not to mention, those beef liver and apple treats... they're the best! We've been doing our best tricks to earn them. We've been feeling so loved and entertained. Lots of purrs and tail wags! From: Sophie, Acd, Dewbert, and Two
