Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 881767131
============================================================

Dear Human,

We're just paw-sing to write you a letter! We've been having a ball with the bacon-flavored treats and the squeaky rabbit toy. You should see us when it's treat time - we get zoomies of excitement! And the rabbit toy, oh boy, it brings out the playful hunters in us. Copper especially enjoys the beef and bison flavored high-protein food - he gobbles it up in no time! And Potato, well, she prefers the chicken recipe dry food. We don't know what we'd do without these paw-some meals. Thank you for filling our days with joy, fun, and yumminess!

With all our love and zoomies,
Potato and Copper
