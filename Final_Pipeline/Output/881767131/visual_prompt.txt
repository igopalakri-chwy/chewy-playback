The artwork features two pets: a curious cat and an active dog. The cat, a medium-sized 15-pound domestic breed, is portrayed playfully batting at a squeaky rabbit toy. The dog, a 59-pound adult Vizsla, is happily munching on a large beef and bison flavored bone. Earthy green and blue tones dominate the scene, reflecting the urban cityscape seen through a window behind them, subtly featuring the Space Needle and Puget Sound. The sleek metallic texture gives the scene a contemporary vibe, with the Chewy logo subtly visible on a food bowl and toy bin. The atmosphere is bright, sunny, and uplifting, highlighting the active and affectionate nature of the pets.
