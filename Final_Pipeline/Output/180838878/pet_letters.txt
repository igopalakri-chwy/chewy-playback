Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 180838878
============================================================

Dear Human,

We have been meaning to write you a letter to express our gratitude for the mouth-watering meals and fun-filled playtimes! As a trio of health-conscious pets, we absolutely adore the variety of delicious and nutritious foods you serve us. The chicken in gravy cat food is a feast fit for a king, Atticus purrs in agreement. Luna and Wallace give a wag of approval for the different flavored dental bone dog treats, their favorite being the one with natural bacon. They keep our teeth clean and our tails wagging! The rubber ball toy is the hero of our playtimes, we have countless zoomies chasing it around. We may not understand what this Chewy+ Membership means, but if it brings more of these joys to our lives, we are all for it!

With all our love,
Atticus, Luna, and Wallace
