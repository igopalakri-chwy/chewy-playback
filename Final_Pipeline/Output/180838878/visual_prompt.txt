============================================================

In an atmosphere of Pacific Northwest Contemporary style, there are three pets: a cat and two dogs. The cat is an adult of unknown size, weighing 14 pounds. It's an older cat, 17 years of age, with an appearance common to many domestic breeds. The two dogs have an unknown mix of breeds, each weighing 45 pounds. One of the dogs is a 5-year-old Siberian Husky, while the other dog is 6 years old. The setting is minimalistic, with earthy tones and textures of wood and stone. The pets are in a playful mood, chasing a medium-sized rubber ball. In the background, there's a subtle hint of Native American influences. A forest, lake, and mountain view forms the backdrop, reminiscent of Redmond, WA. The pets' Chewy+ Membership card is subtly placed on a wooden coffee table, and their favorite treats are scattered around.
