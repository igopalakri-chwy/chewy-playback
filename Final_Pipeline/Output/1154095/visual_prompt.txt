============================================================

A modern, clean setting with a smooth neutral color palette. In the center, two cats, Sue Ling, an older American Shorthair, and Sugar, a senior cat of an unknown breed, are happily exploring their new playpens. They both have a raised food bowl beside them, one in sakura and the other in nordic blue. Nearby, a heated pad is placed invitingly, the perfect spot for a nap. Not far off, two dog houses serve as the cats' new hideouts, with baby blankets visible inside, adding a touch of warmth to the scene. Chewy branding is subtly present on the side of the food bowls and the heated pad.
