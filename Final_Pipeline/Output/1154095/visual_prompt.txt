Imagine a cozy scene with two adult cats, Sue Ling, an American Shorthair, and Sugar, a cat of unknown breed. They're lounging in a spacious, sturdy playpen with raised platforms for them to perch on. Nearby, there's a wall-mounted scratcher - it's clearly a favorite, given the scratch marks. A couple of steps away, there are raised food bowls with beautiful designs, one of them is filled with chicken-flavored food. In a warmer corner of the room, there's a soft heated pad, big enough for both cats to snuggle on. Outside, you can see a couple of stylish cat houses, just the perfect size for a cat to curl up in. Subtle Chewy branding can be spotted on the food bowls and the cat houses.
