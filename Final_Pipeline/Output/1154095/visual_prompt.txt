Picture a cozy, Chewy-branded living room scene. There are two adorable cats, an American Shorthair named Sue Ling and an older cat named Sugar, each with their distinctive raised food bowls. They're enjoying a meal of their favorite chicken dry food. Nearby, there's a sturdy wall scratcher with subtle Chewy branding and two comfortable plastic playpens where the cats often nap. A warm heated pad is set aside for when they want a cozy snuggle. Outside the window, you can see two cute dog houses, each with a tastefully embossed Chewy logo.
