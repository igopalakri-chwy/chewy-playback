Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1154095
============================================================

Hello there! This is Sue Ling and Sugar penning a note to you. We just wanted to say thank you for all the wonderful things you've gotten for us! We absolutely adore the sturdy playpen where we love to lounge and the curved sides make it so cozy. We've also been enjoying our raised food bowls â€“ they are pretty and make meal times so much easier. Did we mention the wall scratcher? It's purrfect for our daily claw workouts! And oh, the heated pad has been a blessing for our older selves. Plus, the outdoor houses have been a great addition for our naps in the sun. We might be picky eaters, but the chicken flavored food you got us has been a hit - we gobble it up every time! So, in a nutshell, we are two happy kitties! Love and purrs, Sue Ling and Sugar
