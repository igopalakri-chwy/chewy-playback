Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1154095
============================================================

Hello hooman! It's your favorite feline duo, Sue Ling and Sugar. We're having a purr-fect time with all these wonderful products. We absolutely adore our comfortable plastic playpens and the sturdy wall scratcher. It's pure joy scratching and stretching on it! The raised food bowls you got us have made meal times much more enjoyable. They're just the right height for us older cats and the color is simply fabulous. And oh, the tasty turkey wet food and chicken dry food you've been feeding us, yum! We've also been loving the warm heated pads. They're so snuggly and cozy, we can nap on them all day long. And we've noticed the cute dog houses in the yard, they're quite spacious and comfy. From your loving, Sue Ling and Sugar!
