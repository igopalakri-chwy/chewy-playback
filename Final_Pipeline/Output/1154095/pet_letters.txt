Dear Human,

We're so excited to tell you how much we love everything you've brought into our lives! Every day with you is filled with joy and adventure, and we can't help but wag our tails (and purr) with gratitude for all the wonderful things you do for us. Thank you for being the best human ever and for making our lives so full of love and happiness!

With all our love and zoomies,
