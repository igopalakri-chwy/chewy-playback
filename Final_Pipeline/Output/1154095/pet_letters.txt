Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1154095
============================================================

Dear human, we, Sue Ling and Sugar, love to hear the sound of the Chewy box being opened. The excitement of finding out what's inside is always the highlight of our day. We especially love the sturdy playpens you got us. They are purr-fectly comfortable, and we can't resist the urge to jump right in! We also appreciate the raised food bowls. They are so stylish and they make meal times much easier. We're older cats, and we appreciate a little luxury. Plus, the food you give us, oh, how tasty it is! We always look forward to meal times. We also love the wall scratcher. It's like a little gym for us to stretch and keep our claws healthy. The heated pads you got us are so warm and cozy. We love curling up on them and taking our afternoon naps. Lastly, the dog houses you bought for us are surprisingly spacious and comfy, we feel like we're on a grand adventure every time we hop in. We can't wait for the next Chewy box! Love, Sue Ling and Sugar.
