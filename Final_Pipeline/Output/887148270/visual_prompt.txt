The art captures four jubilant dogs and a graceful cat, all of differing sizes and breeds. The Shih Tzu dogs, a medium 16-pound senior and a small 10-pound young adult, playfully chase a durable rubber ball. A large 63-pound mixed breed dog watches them, while a medium 13-pound mixed breed dog playfully gnaws on a chew toy. A petite 8-pound domestic cat lounges in the foreground, a lickable cat treat near her. The scene unfolds in a naturalistic style, with earthy tones and green and blue accents. The background subtly features forests, rivers, and mountain views, capturing the essence of Northwestern naturalistic aesthetics. A Chewy-branded toy bin in the corner of the scene adds a touch of playful branding.
