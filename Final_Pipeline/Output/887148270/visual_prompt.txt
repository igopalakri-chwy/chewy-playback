The scene features three dogs and one cat: Maxine, Theo, Gigi, and Anyanka. Maxine and Theo, the Shih Tzus, are small and fluffy, with their fur styled in typical fashion. Gigi is a larger, more robust dog with a coat of mixed colors, while Anyanka is a sleek, elegant cat. They're all in a naturalistic setting that's imbued with earthy tones and rough textures. The rubber ball, a favorite amongst the pets, is prominently featured in the scene. It's a bright spot in the earth-toned setting. Chewy branding is subtly incorporated in the ball design. The light is bright and warm, casting a cheerful glow on our pets and making their fur shine. The style of the artwork is contemporary with a touch of Native American influence, seen in the patterned blanket draped over a log where Daniel, a mixed breed dog, rests.
