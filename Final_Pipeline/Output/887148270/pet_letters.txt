Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Woof, meow, and hello! We are Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel, the four-legged members of the family. We noticed you were considering some new items for us and we have a few thoughts. We hear a soft rubber ball is all the rage among us pets. It's durable and fun, perfect for a game of fetch or just to chew on. It's got our tail wags and purrs of approval. We wouldn't mind if one of those found its way into our toy bin. We've been behaving, promise! Well, most of us. (We're looking at you, Gigi.) With love and wagging tails, Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel.
