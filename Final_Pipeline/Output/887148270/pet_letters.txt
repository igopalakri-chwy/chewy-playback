Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Dear Human,

We've been having so much fun with the new toys you got us! Theo and I (Maxine) can't get enough of the bouncy rubber ball. It's so fun to chase around the living room and it never seems to break, no matter how hard we chew on it. Even Daniel and Gigi join in on the fun sometimes, though Daniel, being the oldest among us dogs, prefers to watch us play with a smile on his face. Gigi, on the other hand, loves to pounce on the ball when it comes rolling her way. Anyanka, our feline sister, usually watches us from her perch with a bemused expression.

We can't wait for more fun times and toys! We promise to behave (mostly) and give you all the snuggles and puppy-dog eyes you could ever want.

With all our love and zoomies,
Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel
