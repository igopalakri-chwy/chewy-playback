Woof, meow, and waggy tails! It's us, Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel! We've been having a paw-some time with our new rubber ball. It's so bouncy and fun, perfect for a game of fetch! And the best part? It's fuzz-free, so no mess for us (or our humans) to clean up. It's been a hit with us dogs, and even Anyanka sometimes bats it around with her paw when she thinks no one is watching. We love our peaceful, modern home, it's the perfect place for a good romp or a cozy nap. So, here's a wag from our tails and a purr from our hearts, because we're living our absolute best lives. From: Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel
