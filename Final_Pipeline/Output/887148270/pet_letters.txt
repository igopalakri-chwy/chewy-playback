Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Dear Human,

Woofs and purrs from your faithful companions. We're all wagging tails and purring motors over here! We can't get enough of that brilliant rubber ball you got us, it's the bee's knees. It's perfect for a game of fetch and even better for a good chew. And Theo, our youngest pup, is especially fond of it. He's always running around the house with it, his little tail wagging at turbo speed. The rest of us prefer to lounge about, but we all enjoy a good play session now and then. We're a happy bunch, always ready for a cuddle or a fun time. We hope you're as happy as we are!

With all our love and wagging tails,
Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel
