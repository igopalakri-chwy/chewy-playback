Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Dear Human,

Oh, the zoomies of joy we get when we see the rubber balls you got for us! They are so much fun to play with and none of us can tear them up, not even Gigi with her strong jaws. They are perfect for our playtime, and having two of them just doubles the fun! We all love them, even Anyanka, who usually prefers to watch us from her favorite spot. She's been giving the balls an interested glance or two lately.

Maxine and Theo, our adorable Shih Tzus, are having the most fun with them. Maxine, despite her age, is as playful as a pup when she sees the balls. Theo, being young and energetic, can play for hours. Gigi and Daniel, our mixed breed pals, are not far behind. They bring so much joy and laughter into our lives. Anyanka, our feline sister, usually prefers to observe us from a distance, but even she seems interested in the balls.

We just wanted to say thank you for making us so happy. We hope you are as happy to see us play as we are when we see those rubber balls.

With all our love and zoomies,
Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka and Daniel
