Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Hello from your furry family! We're wagging our tails and purring with delight over here. That rubber ball you got us? It's the best thing since treats! We can't stop playing with it, and it's so durable even our big dog sibling can't tear it up. We may not be able to talk your language, but our happy dances and zoomies should tell you how much we love it. Lots of licks and purrs, Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel
