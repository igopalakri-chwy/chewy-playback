Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 887148270
============================================================

Hello Human! It's us, your delightful fur family - Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel. We've been noticing the new items you've been getting us and we absolutely love them! That bouncy rubber ball you got recently has been a blast. We've been doing zoomies all day with it. The best part is, it doesn't tear up like those pesky tennis balls. We promise to keep being good if you keep the fun stuff coming. Being a part of this family is the best thing ever, and every day feels like a new adventure. Love, Maxine, Theo, Gigi, Anyanka, and Daniel
