Two small Biewer Terrier dogs are the stars of this vibrant, beach-influenced portrait. The senior, 12-year-old dog is petite, weighing only 6 pounds, while the 10-year-old, slightly larger at 11 pounds, stands proudly beside her. Both dogs are engaged in a playful romp, their faces full of joy and their tails wagging energetically. The backdrop is a warm, sandy beach with softly swaying palm trees and a breathtaking ocean view. Integrated subtly into the scene are chew treats, a testament to their love for this particular pastime. The Chewy brand is subtly incorporated, visible on the label of a treat bag lying nearby. The overall scene is bright, the lighting warm and inviting, highlighting the dogs' joyful energy against the tropical coastal aesthetics.
