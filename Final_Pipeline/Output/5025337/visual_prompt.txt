Imagine two Biewer Terriers, Harley (James) Davidson and The Princess Monaco, set against a beachfront modern backdrop. Harley, a medium-sized 10-year-old, is energetically playing with a freeze-dried meal shaped toy while The Princess Monaco, a smaller 12-year-old, is contentedly gnawing on a chewy treat. Their coats glisten in the well-lit setting, reflecting hues of cool blues and whites. Sandy textures add a tactile depth to their fur. The scene is influenced by nautical and tropical aesthetics, with a sophisticated tone. Chewy branding can be subtly seen on their toy bin and food bowl.
