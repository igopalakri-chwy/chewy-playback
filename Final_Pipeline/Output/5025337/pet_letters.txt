Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5025337
============================================================

Dear Human,

We've been having a tail-wagging good time enjoying our yummy treats! They give us so much joy that we can't help but do zoomies of joy around the house. Even our senior sis, The Princess Monaco, gets in on the fun with her own little piece. Can't wait for more treat times!

With pawfuls of love, Harley and The Princess Monaco
