Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5025337
============================================================

Hello Hooman! Your snuggle squad of Biewer Terriers is reporting in: Harley, Princess, Venison, and Turkey. We're having the zoomies of joy over here because of all the yummy food you've been spoiling us with! We can't get enough of the grain-free nuggets, especially the ones with rabbit, venison, and duck. Oh, and the turkey and sardine flavored ones? Pawsitively delightful! We also love the freeze-dried duck treats and crunchy chicken shreds. Let's not forget the training pads too, they've been so useful. We're all wagging our tails in anticipation of the next mealtime. Love and licks, Harley, Princess, Venison, and Turkey
