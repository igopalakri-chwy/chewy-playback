Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5025337
============================================================

Hello Human! We, the Snuggle Squad, are writing to you with tails wagging and tongues out! We really love our meal times, especially when we get to enjoy those grain-free nuggets full of organic veggies and fruits. They come in so many exciting flavors! We get zoomies just thinking about the venison, rabbit, and turkey & sardine ones. They are paw-sitively delicious! And oh, those freeze-dried duck treats? They are the perfect size and so soft, perfect for our little mouths. We also love the crunchy Primal Chicken Shredders that give us a good chew time. We can't wait for our next meal. It's all tail wags and belly rubs over here! From: The Princess Monaco, Turkey, Venison, and Harley (James) Davidson
