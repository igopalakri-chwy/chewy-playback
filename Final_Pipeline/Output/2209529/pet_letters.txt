Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 2209529
============================================================

Dear Human, We, the four feline residents of your abode, pen this letter with our soft paws to express our affectionate purrs of satisfaction. Our collective whiskers have been twitching in excitement over the delicious and crunchy turkey flavored dry food you've been serving us. It's a delight to our discerning taste buds, making us purr in harmony. The beef and turkey pate canned food too, is a winner in our books! It's so good for our tummies and we absolutely love it. We appreciate the thoughtfulness you've put into selecting these sophisticated and refined meals for us. We are a finicky bunch, as you well know, but these meals pass the test. We look forward to more of these gastronomic adventures. Yours playfully, Oat, Bella, Marco, and The Fourth One
