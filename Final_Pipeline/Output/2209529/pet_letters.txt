Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 2209529
============================================================

Hello Human,

It's your loving, finicky and somewhat selective feline squad reporting in. We just wanted to say that we're purringly grateful for the delicious meals you've been providing us. Our tummies are doing somersaults of joy after every meal. The turkey and beef pate recipe, oh, that's simply the cat's meow! It's like a festival of flavors in our mouths - and no more upset tummies or hairballs. Yay! We also love the crunchy kibbles, the larger the better, as they add to our fun mealtime adventures.

We're a little picky, we admit, but who can blame us? We're cats, after all! We appreciate you taking the time to find the food that suits us best. We're really hoping that our favorite formulas don't change because, trust us, we've got the purrfect thing going on here!

With love and purrs,

The 4 Pets - Unknown, Marco, Bella, and Oat
