Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 2209529
============================================================

Dear Human,

We're writing this letter from our comfy spots on the couch. We've been enjoying the food you've been giving us, especially the beef and chicken flavors. No more fish, please! Bella's tummy appreciates it. Also, we've noticed that the kibble size is just purrfect for us. Keep up the good work!

With all our love and purrs,
Bella and Marco
