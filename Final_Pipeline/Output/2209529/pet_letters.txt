Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 2209529
============================================================

Hello hooman! It's your favorite feline squad - Bella, Oat, Marco, and our mysterious friend, reporting in! We hope you're as excited about mealtime as we are. We've been having a blast with the grain-free turkey pate and the beef and turkey pate - so delicious, we can't get enough! The turkey formula dry food is also a hit, we all love the crunch. We've also been digging the white meat chicken and whole oat meal recipe. Keep these coming, and watch us do the purr-fect happy dance! Love and purrs, Bella, Oat, Marco, and our unnamed friend.
