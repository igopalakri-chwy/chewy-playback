# Enhanced Pet Detection System

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the enhanced pet detection system that combines **LLM analysis** with a **hashmap approach** to intelligently detect additional pets mentioned in customer reviews.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The `detect_additional_pets_from_reviews` method used hard-coded pattern matching (e.g., "three cats", "3 cats") which was:
- ❌ Limited to specific phrases
- ❌ Created generic "UNK" pets without tracking counts
- ❌ Missed many valid pet mentions
- ❌ Prone to false positives

**Solution**: LLM-powered pet count detection with intelligent comparison against known pet profiles from Snowflake.

## How It Works

### 1. **Enhanced Hashmap Approach** 
The system now handles **three types of pet detection**:

#### **Count-Based Detection**
```python
# Known pets from Snowflake profiles
known_counts = {"cat": 2}  # 2 cats in profiles

# LLM detects from reviews: "my 3 cats love this"
detected_counts = {"cat": 3}  # 3 cats mentioned

# System creates additional pet: 3 - 2 = 1 additional cat
additional_pets = [{"name": "Additional_Cat_1", "type": "cat", "detection_method": "count_based_detection"}]
```

#### **Named Pet Detection**
```python
# Known pets: ["Fluffy", "Whiskers"]  
# Review mentions: "Charlie loves this toy!"

# System detects new named pet
additional_pets = [{"name": "Charlie", "type": "dog", "detection_method": "named_pet_detection"}]
```

#### **Unnamed Species Detection**
```python
# Known pets: {"cat": 2}  # No dogs in profiles
# Review mentions: "my dog loves this"

# System creates unnamed pet for new species
additional_pets = [{"name": "UNK_DOG", "type": "dog", "detection_method": "unnamed_species_detection"}]
```

### 2. **Enhanced LLM Analysis**
The system uses GPT-4 to analyze review text and extract **both counts and names**:

```python
def _analyze_pet_ownership_with_llm(self, review_text: str, known_counts: Dict[str, int]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Returns structured data:
    return {
        "pet_counts": {"dog": 2, "cat": 3},          # Count-based detection
        "named_pets": [                               # Named pet detection
            {"name": "Charlie", "species": "dog"},
            {"name": "Bella", "species": "cat"}
        ]
    }
```

**LLM Prompting Strategy:**
- ✅ **Ownership indicators**: "my 3 cats", "both of my dogs", "all 4 of them"
- ✅ **Named pet extraction**: "Charlie loves this", "Max and Bella enjoy"
- ✅ **Species association**: Links names to species when mentioned
- ❌ **Filters out**: Product descriptions, other people's pets, hypotheticals

### 3. **Smart Pet Creation**
When discrepancies are found, the system creates meaningful additional pets:
- ✅ **Specific names**: `Additional_Cat_1`, `Additional_Dog_2`
- ✅ **Known types**: Extracted from review analysis
- ✅ **Metadata tracking**: Source, confidence, detection method
- ✅ **Proper integration**: Works with all pipeline stages

## Implementation Details

### Core Methods

#### `_detect_additional_pets_with_llm()`
- **Input**: Customer reviews + known pet profiles from Snowflake
- **Process**: Extract current counts → LLM analysis → Compare → Create additional pets
- **Output**: Complete pet count analysis with additional pet definitions

#### `_analyze_pet_ownership_with_llm()`
- **Input**: Review text + known pet counts
- **Process**: GPT-4 analysis with sophisticated prompting
- **Output**: Validated pet counts by type

#### `analyze_customer_with_cached_data()` (Enhanced)
- **Integration**: Now uses enhanced pet detection
- **Features**: Handles both registered pets and additional pets
- **Metadata**: Tracks detection source and confidence

### Pipeline Integration

#### Review & Order Intelligence Agent
```python
# Enhanced method signature
def _get_customer_pets_from_reviews(self, customer_reviews: pd.DataFrame, known_pet_profiles: List[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        'pet_names': ['Fluffy', 'Whiskers', 'Additional_Cat_1'],
        'pet_count_analysis': {
            'original_counts': {'cat': 2},
            'detected_counts': {'cat': 3}, 
            'updated_counts': {'cat': 3},
            'additional_pets': [...]
        }
    }
```

#### Main Pipeline
```python
# Enhanced save_outputs method
profile_data = {
    **pets_data,
    'pet_count_analysis': {
        'original_counts': {'cat': 2},
        'detected_counts': {'cat': 3},
        'updated_counts': {'cat': 3},
        'additional_pets_detected': 1
    }
}
```

## Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Count-Based Detection**
**Input Data:**
- **Snowflake Pet Profiles**: 2 cats (Fluffy, Whiskers)
- **Customer Review**: *"My 3 cats absolutely love this food! All three of them finish their bowls quickly."*

**Process**: `{"cat": 2}` → LLM detects `{"cat": 3}` → Creates `Additional_Cat_1`

### **Scenario 2: Named Pet Detection**
**Input Data:**
- **Snowflake Pet Profiles**: 2 cats (Fluffy, Whiskers)
- **Customer Review**: *"Charlie loves this new toy! He plays with it every day."*

**Process**: Known pets don't include "Charlie" → LLM detects `{"name": "Charlie", "species": "dog"}` → Creates `Charlie`

### **Scenario 3: Unnamed Species Detection**
**Input Data:**
- **Snowflake Pet Profiles**: 2 cats (Fluffy, Whiskers)
- **Customer Review**: *"My dog really enjoys these treats. Great quality!"*

**Process**: No dogs in profiles → LLM detects `{"dog": 1}` → Creates `UNK_DOG`

### **Combined Output Example:**
```json
{
  "Fluffy": { /* existing cat profile */ },
  "Whiskers": { /* existing cat profile */ },
  "Additional_Cat_1": {
    "PetName": "Additional_Cat_1",
    "PetType": "Cat",
    "DetectionSource": "review_analysis",
    "DetectionMethod": "count_based_detection",
    "DetectionType": "count_based"
  },
  "Charlie": {
    "PetName": "Charlie", 
    "PetType": "Dog",
    "DetectionSource": "review_analysis",
    "DetectionMethod": "named_pet_detection",
    "DetectionType": "named_pet"
  },
  "UNK_DOG": {
    "PetName": "UNK_DOG",
    "PetType": "Dog", 
    "DetectionSource": "review_analysis",
    "DetectionMethod": "unnamed_species_detection",
    "DetectionType": "unnamed_species"
  },
  "pet_count_analysis": {
    "original_counts": {"cat": 2},
    "detected_counts": {"cat": 3, "dog": 2},
    "updated_counts": {"cat": 3, "dog": 2},
    "additional_pets_detected": 3
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits

- Avoids false positives from product descriptions

### ✅ **Proper Count Tracking** 
- Maintains hashmap of pet counts by type
- Compares structured vs unstructured data
- Updates customer profiles accurately

### ✅ **Meaningful Pet Creation**
- Creates specific additional pets instead of generic "UNK"
- Includes metadata about detection source and confidence
- Integrates seamlessly with existing pipeline stages

### ✅ **Pipeline Integration**
- Works with cached Snowflake data

## Configuration

### Environment Requirements
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for LLM analysis
- **Snowflake Data**: Pet profiles and review data
- **Python Dependencies**: pandas, openai, json, logging

### Performance Considerations
- **Token Management**: Review text truncated to 3000 characters

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Multi-language support** for review analysis
2. **Named Entity Recognition** for specific pet name detection
3. **Confidence scoring** based on review quality and quantity
4. **Historical trend analysis** of pet mentions over time
