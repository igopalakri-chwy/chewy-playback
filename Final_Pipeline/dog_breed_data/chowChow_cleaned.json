  "breed_intro": "Independent and sometimes aloof, Chow Chows don’t accept just anyone into their inner circle, but that’s OK.  \n\nIf you’re looking for a pup to live the A-list lifestyle with you, you’ve found them. The regal and fluffy Chow Chow looks the part of a celebrity, with their shaggy hair and eye-catching appearance. \n\nJust like you, they enjoy mornings lounging in bed. They’ll also probably want the AC permanently on high—don’t even think about touching it—but with all that fur, you can hardly blame them.",
  "appearance_description": "With a regal, lion-like appearance, these medium-sized dogs might be red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream. You might also find them in white, lilac, or merle. \n\nTheir coat can be either a smooth or rough type, and their defining feature is their Chow Chow tongue that’s a lovely gray-blue color.",
  "temperament_description": "If you’re looking for a dog who’s a big snuggler, the Chow Chow might not be your pup. They aren’t overly affectionate, and while you’ll always be their one and only, they’re usually not people pleasers either.  \n\nBut that’s actually OK because Chow Chows tend to be so well-behaved on their own: They’re clean, fairly quiet, and easy to housetrain. They’re also low maintenance when it comes to exercise, but take note: You’re going to need to spend extra on grooming.  \n\nChow Chows take time to warm up to strangers. You’ll need to socialize your Chow Chow puppy early (or as early as possible if you adopt them as an adult) so they learn that new visitors are nothing to fear—and perhaps someone to be embraced.   \n\nWhen properly socialized, these pups can make great family dogs and can even get along with canine friends at home. Unfortunately, Chow Chows probably won’t tolerate a feline in their home thanks to their history as hunting and herding dogs.  \n\nThey also will do best with older children who understand that they’re not into all that mushy love and cuddling stuff. But if you teach younger children how to interact with these unique dogs, it could work out.",
  "care_description": "Facts are facts, and Chow Chows require lots of grooming. They aren’t high-energy dogs who need a lot of exercise (a daily walk or two is great), so you can use that extra bonding time for extra brushing.  \n\nWhile Chow dogs may not be overly showy with their affection, they’re super smart and quick learners when it comes to training.",
  "grooming_description": "It’s important to get into a good grooming routine with your pup.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: Plan on bathing your dog every two to four weeks. Thoroughly rinse out the shampoo, as any remaining residue can cause dryness, flakiness, and irritation to the skin.  \nBrushing: Some breeds need an occasional brushing with just one tool, but your Chow Chow will need brushing sessions with a grooming toolkit twice a week. Remember that shaving your Chow Chow is not an option (they need their double coat to protect them from the heat and cold equally). For brushing, you’ll need the following tools:  \r\n\n\t• Course comb (to help remove the fluffy undercoat) \nHair detangler (to get out any matting)  \nPin brush (to groom the longer, coarser guard hairs) \nSlicker brush (to remove mats and tangles) \r\n\nDental care: Start brushing your dog's teeth a couple times a week to get them used to it, then work up to doing it daily. Once a year, get a pro cleaning at your vet. \nEar care: Pat your Chow Chow’s outer ears after bath time with a dry cotton ball, as excess moisture can lead to ear infections. Always check both ears for signs of irritation, debris, or a bad smell, which could signal an infection.  \nNail care: Using pet nail trimmers, keep your dog’s nails clipped. Once a month is usually enough, but you’ll know it’s time when you hear clacking on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Known for their smarts, the Chow Chow is ready and willing to learn if you make training a priority. They’ll probably ace basic cues, like sit and come, as young as 8 weeks old.  \n\nIf you adopt your dog when they’re older, chat with your vet about when to train and how to socialize your Chow Chow. Finding a certified dog trainer can help with this breed, too. \n\nA Chow Chow’s temperament makes them naturally reserved around strangers, so they might be aloof around new people. Exposing them to different people, other pets, and new places when they’re young can help them grow into confident adults.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Chow Chow, but every dog needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. You should also choose a diet for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nTreats can be an important part of training, but don’t overdo it. Dog treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories. \n\nThe Chow Chow’s size and deep chest makes them susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), a medical emergency where the stomach expands and twists, cutting off blood flow.  Pet parents can take steps during mealtimes to reduce the risk of bloat by:  \r\n\n\t• Using a slow feeder bowl \nAvoiding elevated food and water bowls \nLimiting exercise for an hour before and after your Chow Chow eats",
  "exercise_description": "Chow Chows are active, alert dogs who are going to fully enjoy their daily walks and regular playtime. But if you suggest a 10K, they might have other ideas. \n\nThere’s no need for any high-impact exercises with this calm breed. They’re not known for their speed, anyway, but they will enjoy playing with their favorite toys and leisurely strolls (a couple of 20-minute walks every day is enough to keep a Chow Chow happy).  \n\nRemember that their body isn’t built for extreme heat or humidity, so plan your outdoor activities accordingly. Indoors, be prepared to keep the AC on high if necessary.",
  "ideal_environment": "Chow Chows prefer cooler climates, but that doesn’t mean you have to move to the Arctic Circle to make this dog a member of the family.   \n\nThey don’t need a ton of space to be happy, either—as long as you stick to their very basic exercise routine of daily walks. They don’t bark a lot, so an apartment isn’t out of the question if you have a park or somewhere else nearby where your Chow Chow can take a leisurely stroll.  \n\nChow Chow dogs can do well with families with older kids who understand that these pups need their space and don’t like to be climbed on or hugged tight. Chow Chows may also need an experienced pet parent who can confidently and kindly train and socialize them.",
  "health_description": "The Chow Chow lifespan is 8–12 years, but there are a few health issues pet parents should be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Allergies: Allergies may manifest as itchy skin around your pet’s feet, stomach, skin folds, or ears. Chow Chows may have seasonal allergies or food allergies, and your vet may recommend testing with a veterinary dermatologist.  \nBloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Chow Chows may be at risk of a life-threatening condition called bloat. It occurs when the stomach gets distended with air and/or food.  \nA serious complication of bloat is GDV, when the stomach twists on itself, cutting off blood supply. Symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately.  \nCancer: Stomach cancer is rare in most dogs, but unfortunately Chow Chows have 10–20 times the risk of other pups. They may also be prone to melanoma, or skin cancer. \nElbow and hip dysplasia: With elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia, the joint doesn’t fit properly. Treatment can involve joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or, in severe cases, surgery. \nEndocrine conditions: Chow Chows can develop hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Both are diagnosed through a blood test and can be managed with lifelong daily medication.  \nAlopecia X: Alopecia X is hair loss that often affects dogs with thick undercoats. There are a variety of treatments, from melatonin to medications, depending on the severity.  \nEye issues: Chow Chows are prone to several eye problems, including: \r\n\n\t• Ectropion, which causes the lower eyelid to fold outward  \nEntropion, where the eyelid folds inward \nGlaucoma, a medical emergency that causes pain, pressure, and blindness \nCataracts that hinder vision   \r\n\nLuxating patella: Chow Chows can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. A little bunny hop or skip while walking could be a symptom. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary.",
  "history_description": "One of the world’s most ancient breeds, the Chow Chow’s origins go as far back as 206 BCE, and maybe even earlier.   \n\nIn their earliest years, these dogs were used for hunting, herding livestock, and even pulling sleds. Over time, they rose through the ranks to become faithful companions to Chinese nobility.  \n\nIn the 1800s, Queen Victoria was said to have her own Chow Chow, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1903.  \n\nThe average Chow Chow price tends to be between $1,800–$3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Chow Chow adoption, as there are many waiting for their forever homes. Reach out to a local Chow rescue organization, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

    {
      "question": "Are Chow Chows hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Chow Chows are not a hypoallergenic dog breed. If you have allergies to pet dander or fur, the Chow Chow’s propensity to shed will unfortunately mean you need to choose a different best friend."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are Chow Chows' tongues blue?",
      "answer": "Chow Chows have black-blue tongues due to the presence of pigmented cells—the same ones that give humans different skin colors. Chow Chow puppies aren’t born with blue tongues; they start to turn blue as they grow."
