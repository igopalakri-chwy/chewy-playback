  "breed_intro": "Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular dog breeds, and it's easy to see why. These high-energy, social butterflies enjoy being the center of attention and love their humans as much as they love to fetch. They're also intelligent, albeit a bit cheeky. You can always count on a Golden Retriever to be the life of the party.",
  "appearance_description": "Golden Retrievers' expressive eyes reflect their good-natured hearts. They carry themselves proudly, with plumed tails wagging merrily and their noses always sniffing out a new adventure. Their feathered coats come in different shades of gold, from light golden to dark golden. As they age, some Goldens develop a white-golden color'especially around their sweet faces.",
  "temperament_description": "The Golden Retriever personality is naturally outgoing and eager to please. Although individual personalities can vary, most Goldens love people and social outings, thriving in homes with lively environments.\r\n\r\nGenerally, Goldens are born to mingle and see everyone as a potential new best friend. Whenever they meet someone new, they seem to say, 'Hi! I am so glad we met. Do you have a ball to throw for me now that we're friends?'\r\n\r\nThat friendly demeanor, coupled with their moderate weight and height, make Golden Retrievers excellent dogs for families with young children. However, not all Goldens are without challenges. When bringing a Golden home, cautiously introduce them to household members, especially smaller ones like children and cats, and be sure to teach small children how to behave and interact with dogs as well.\r\n\r\nGoldens are also intelligent; they're quick learners and easy to train. They were and are bred to be gundogs, retrieving waterfowl with their soft mouths, a characteristic that allows them to carry delicate items without applying excessive pressure. They often serve as guide dogs, therapy dogs and search-and-rescue dogs. For optimal health, Golden Retrievers need ample mental and physical exercise.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, though, that even the best-trained Goldens can be mischievous. So be prepared for occasional capers and learn to laugh with your dog as they 'help' you unload the laundry basket.",
  "care_description": "As adaptable and easygoing as Golden Retrievers are, they're not low-maintenance. They need daily exercise, regular brushing and training.",
  "grooming_description": "Mess comes standard with Golden Retrievers, so if you dislike fur tumbleweeds, dirt and drool, look elsewhere for a canine companion.\n\nFor starters, Golden Retrievers shed'¦a lot. As long as you brush that water-repellant coat consistently (at least every one to three days), grooming is relatively easy and will keep professional haircuts few and far between. Focus on the hind legs and behind the ears, where mats can develop quickly. Grooming needs don't vary by coat color, but wavy-haired Retrievers are more prone to tangles than their straight-haired counterparts and may need more brushing.\n\nMORE: A Complete Guide to Brushing a Dog the Right Way, According to a Pro Groomer\n\nOn top of their regular shedding, Golden Retrievers have two major sheds a year'one in the spring and one in the fall'so they'll need to be raked out more frequently during those high-shed times.\n\nThey also love to swim and get muddy. Rinse off your Golden with clean, fresh water if they swim in a lake, salt water or chlorinated pool, and clean their ears to keep yeast at bay.\n\nMORE: How to Groom a Golden Retriever",
  "training_description": "The Golden Retriever dog breed is highly intelligent and eager to please, making them a joy to train. Goldens can easily master basic obedience training commands like sit and stay and even be taught to retrieve different toys by name. They respond best to positive reinforcement training, which uses treats or toys as rewards for desirable behavior.\n\nOf course, no matter how well-trained a Golden is, occasionally they'll be more interested in goofing off than learning their lessons.\n\nIf you want to train your Golden for a particular job, like working as a service dog, remember individual personalities play a big role. Not every Golden is cut out for service dog work.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Experts generally recommend Goldens eat a complete and balanced commercial dog food, but there's no one-size-fits-all feeding chart. Your dog's individual needs will vary, based on their age, weight and activity level. Talk to your vet to figure out the best diet for your dog.\r\n\r\nGolden Retrievers can develop food allergies, which may cause itchy skin and excessive licking. You can manage these reactions by working with a veterinarian and changing their diet.",
  "exercise_description": "Golden Retrievers require lots of physical and mental exercise. Goldens can thrive in small homes if you help them stay active by:\r\n\r\n \tPlaying games, like fetch, chase and those that incorporate scent, like 'find it'\r\n \tOffering interactive dog toys\r\n \tProviding unstructured off-leash time\r\n \tTaking daily walks\r\n \tTaking them swimming (if possible)\r\n\r\nOf course, a large yard doesn't give you an excuse to be lazy. Goldens want to be with you pretty much all the time (that's why we love them!). Join them outside for playtime to help them burn off their endless puppy-like energy.",
  "ideal_environment": "Golden Retrievers love to have lots of room to run around, making them an ideal fit for a home with a large yard. However, they adapt easily and can also thrive in a congested city, so long as there are plenty of opportunities for exercise and mental stimulation. Remember, they have a natural instinct to retrieve, so offer them many positive outlets for that behavior.\r\n\r\nMany Goldens, especially young ones, do well in a bustling home with lots of activity (more people to love them), but as long as they get enough positive attention, they'll adjust to most home environments.",
  "health_description": "Golden Retrievers have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years, but the Golden Retriever lifespan can vary greatly depending on many variables, such as weight, fitness level and illness. Some dogs can live to 14 without issue, while others can develop health problems well before that. The best thing you can do is follow preventative health protocols and know what those potential health problems are, so you can recognize and treat the signs quickly.\n\n \tCancer: The biggest health issue for Goldens is cancer, with up to 65% of them dying of cancer-related causes. Two of the most common types of cancer seen in Golden Retrievers are lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma. Your vet will help determine the appropriate course of treatment if your pup is diagnosed with cancer. It might include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery or palliative care/medications.\n \tSkin Infections and Allergies: The Golden Retriever breed's thick undercoat can attract skin-irritating bacteria, resulting in rashes or hot spots. This can be further complicated by underlying seasonal or food allergies. If you notice your pet itching excessively or redness/rashes on their skin, please make an appointment with your veterinarian.\n \tHip Dysplasia: Roughly 8.5% of Goldens have hip dysplasia, which is a deformity of the hip joint that occurs during puppyhood, resulting in looseness of the joint and eventually degenerative joint disease and arthritis. Treatment options may include joint supplements, medication, and in severe cases, surgery.\n \tHeart Conditions: They are also prone to certain heart conditions, like subaortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the area just below the aortic valve (the valve where blood leaves the heart and travels to the rest of the body). This can sometimes be detected as an audible murmur during a veterinary exam. If a murmur is detected, your veterinarian will likely refer your pup to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).\n \tHypothyroidism: Low thyroid hormone production is a common condition in Golden Retrievers. Symptoms can include lethargy, hair loss and weight gain. If concerned, please see your veterinarian for blood tests. Treatment is typically a daily medication.\n \tEye Conditions: Pigmentary uveitis is an inherited condition where cysts develop on the eye and can lead to cataracts and glaucoma. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is another genetic eye condition that can lead to blindness. If your pup is having any issues with their eyes such as redness, cloudiness, bulging, squinting, pain or trouble seeing, please contact your veterinarian immediately.",
  "history_description": "The Golden Retriever breed originated in the Scottish Highlands through the efforts of Dudley Marjoribanks, the first Lord Tweedmouth. Marjoribanks selectively bred different dog breeds to create an energetic pup who could retrieve objects from the water and on land.\r\n\r\nAmong the breeds that Marjoribanks used in his breeding program were the Yellow Retriever, Irish Setter, Bloodhound, and now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. He eventually developed a retriever with speed, agility and loyalty.\r\n\r\nGoldens began arriving in the United States in the early 1900s and gained recognition from the AKC in 1925. Their popularity skyrocketed when President Gerald Ford had a Golden Retriever of his own named Liberty. Now, many organizations are dedicated to the breed, such as the Golden Retriever Club of America.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Golden Retriever puppies? The American Kennel Club maintains a list of reputable Golden Retriever breeders. Expect to spend anywhere from $1,200 to $3,500 for a pup, depending on the breeder. When selecting a breeder, make sure they screen their dogs for health and temperament issues.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to Golden Retriever rescues to adopt a Golden, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can find a local shelter through Chewy's network.",

All Golden Retrievers are simply Golden Retrievers, and variations in color and body composition are results of breeding for specific traits. Dogs who are bred for field work might be redder and leaner than those bred for the show ring, but beyond that there is little difference in types."
