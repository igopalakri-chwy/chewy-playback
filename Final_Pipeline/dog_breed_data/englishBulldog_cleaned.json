  "breed_intro": "Ready for lots of sloppy kisses and a wrinkly little shadow following you everywhere you go? Affectionate, easygoing, and adorable, the English Bulldog is the definition of “best friend.”  \n\nNot only do English Bulldogs live to make you happy, but they’d also like to befriend every single person (or dog, or cat) they meet. But don’t take it too personally—after all, you’re the one they’ll be cuddled up with at the end of the day. \n\nThese cuties aren’t star athletes like some other breeds, but they’ll happily shuffle next to you on short walks and trips to the dog park. Snuggles on your lap? They’re down for that, too. Don’t tell them they’re a bit bigger than the average lap dog—just let them enjoy.",
  "appearance_description": "The English Bulldog has a stout frame and velvety skin that makes them positively squeezable. They have a prominent underbite, a short snout (they’re what’s known as a brachycephalic breed), and very cute wrinkles that are silly and dignified at the same time.  \n\nBulldogs carry most of their weight in the front half of their body, leaving their trimmer backside and tiny tail free to waggle happily.",
  "temperament_description": "English Bulldogs are known for their loyalty, affectionate nature, and outgoing personality, making them great companions and family dogs. These friendly pups long for a bestie and will bond with almost anyone who cares for them.  \n\nYour English Bulldog is likely to get lots of attention on walks, and they’ll be happy to put on a show, charming everyone from visitors, kids, delivery people, and anyone else you meet. Bulldogs are truly social creatures, but their favorite social interaction of all is curling up next to you on the couch. In fact, you’ll find that snoozing in a comfy spot is their go-to activity. \n\nWhen they’re not cuddling, Bulldogs will get your attention with their—perhaps unintentional—sense of humor. Some pet parents have experienced the “relocation” of belongings like slippers, books, and hats. They might pout and sulk if they feel rebuffed, making some hilarious faces in the process.  \n\nOnce you give them the attention they crave (and who couldn’t?), Bulldogs immediately paw at your for more and win you over with their silly nature. Essentially, if you’re looking for a bestie who also makes you laugh, this is your soul pup.  \n\nBut these smart dogs also have their own thoughts and opinions—and they might be hesitant to change their mind. When it comes to training, high-value treats will help you teach them cues like sit, stay, and come. English Bulldogs usually don’t have a problem with the last cue, though, because they simply love their human so much.",
  "care_description": "English Bulldogs are easygoing and only need moderate exercise, but they’re not necessarily low-maintenance. You’ll need to take extra care of their cute wrinkles and feed them a diet that keeps them lean.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Most English Bulldogs shouldn’t need a bath more than once a month. If they have skin issues, talk to your vet about bathing more frequently.  \nBrushing: An English Bulldog’s short coat is usually simple to maintain with a once-weekly brushing using a slicker brush. \nDental care: Brush their teeth every day with a specially formulated dog toothpaste and dog toothbrush. Get a professional cleaning at your vet’s once a year.  \nNail care: Trim your English Bulldog’s nails once a month. You’ll know it’s time when you hear them clacking as they walk across hard surfaces. \nSkin care: English Bulldogs’ characteristic wrinkles need to be wiped down every day to avoid dirt and moisture getting trapped inside the folds and causing infections. Use a medicated and drying wipe to clean underneath all that skin, especially the wrinkles around the nose and tail.  \r\n\n\t• Make sure to dry all the areas you’ve wiped, as moisture can cause infection. If you notice any redness or irritation, your vet may recommend using a medicated shampoo or mousse for a few days. Don’t forget to clean between the toes, too, as their paws are prone to infection.",
  "training_description": "The key to training an English Bulldog? Patience—and lots of positive reinforcement, of course. \n\nEnglish Bulldogs are independent thinkers, so if you’re looking for a dog who will jump through hoops on command, look elsewhere. These smart cookies know what they like and don’t like—so if they take a bit longer to learn something, it’s not for lack of intelligence. It’s just because they’re not feeling it at this exact moment. The promise of a treat, a fun toy, or praise can often help them along.  \n\nWith proper motivation, your English Bulldog will probably ace all the important cues eventually. Keep going with that positive reinforcement and don’t give up.  \n\nAs with all breeds, early socialization is key for English Bulldog puppies to grow up to be well-adjusted adults, so start introducing them to new people and places as soon as you can. If your dog’s a puppy, your vet can help you decide how soon to make introductions (usually once they’re fully vaccinated). If you adopt an older English Bulldog, your vet can also offer guidance to help them to become the happiest, most confident dog.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best food for English Bulldogs is a high-quality formula that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). \n\nEnglish Bulldogs are a brachycephalic breed, meaning they have shortened snouts and skulls, which gives them their adorable smooshed faces. Unfortunately, though, this condition can also trigger trouble breathing and digestive issues, including vomiting and gagging.  \n\nTo complicate matters, these dogs are speedy eaters who will gulp down whatever is in front of them in seconds. So, you may want to feed your Bulldog smaller meals more often (your vet can tell you exactly how much food and how many times a day) or use a special slow feeder bowl.  \n\nBulldogs are prone to obesity, which will exacerbate medical issues, so make sure you’re not overfeeding them. Remember that treats count, too; treats should never make up more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "If you’re not into intense exercise all that much, the English Bulldog totally gets it. This breed’s flattened snout makes lots of vigorous activity a no-go.  \n\nEven though they may not be super sporty, these silly pups still get the zoomies when the mood strikes. The rest of the time, they’re pretty low-key and enjoy walks where they can stop to smell the flowers. Two or three slow 15-minute walks a day, mixed in with a few trips to the dog park or doggy playdates a few times a week, is perfect.  \n\nOverexertion—especially in hot or cold weather—is very dangerous for the English Bulldog. Schedule outdoor time for the cooler parts of the day and avoid extreme heat and freezing temperatures. \n\nDon’t forget to entertain your pup’s mind, too. Have some dog puzzles around the house and regularly initiate casual games, like tug-of-war or fetch.",
  "ideal_environment": "English Bulldogs don’t need fancy digs or a big backyard to be happy. When it comes to the safest, most comfortable environment for this breed, it comes down to one thing: air-conditioning.  \n\nIt’s very easy for them to overheat, so they don’t like to be in the sun or left home alone without the air on in warmer months. Bulldogs do best in temperate climates where it doesn’t get too hot or too cold.  \n\nOther than that, they’re adaptable and social pups who would love to be in a home with lots of people—kids and other animals included—to give them attention. If you’re a single pet parent, that’s great too, as long as you have plenty of love to give this deserving pup. Offer them lots of affection, snuggles, and praise, and an English Bulldog will be your bestie forever.",
  "health_description": "The English Bulldog lifespan is 8–10 years. The breed can develop a number of health issues over their life, so you might want to consider pet insurance to offset the costs of vet care.   \r\n\n\t• Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome: Also known as BOAS, this condition is caused by the English Bulldog’s smooshed-face anatomy. It makes breathing difficult for these pups, especially during exercise and in extreme temperatures. Talk to your vet about how to best manage BOAS (keeping your Bulldog at a healthy weight helps a lot!). \nEye issues: Bulldogs tend to experience two eye issues: Cherry eye (when the pink, fleshy part of the eye’s corner becomes swollen and bulges out of its pocket) and entropion (in which the eyelid rolls inward and causes irritation). Both conditions are treated with surgery.  \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones doesn’t properly fit. It can be an inherited condition and often results in pain, limping, and arthritis. Treatment options include weight management, physical therapy, joint supplements, pain medication, and, in severe cases, surgery.  \nSkin infections: Those charming face wrinkles can trap bits of food and moisture—it’s OK, no one’s perfect. But bacteria and yeast can multiply there, leading to skin infections. Keep them at bay by cleaning your English Bulldog’s folds every day, and monitor for signs of infection, like itchiness, bumps, scabs, irritation, redness, or swollen skin.",
  "history_description": "Were you once a college athlete who now gets winded bringing the laundry upstairs? That’s the 800-year history of the English Bulldog in a nutshell. \n\nBulldogs most likely originated in England and may have descended from ancient Mastiff-like breeds. Sometime between the 13th and 16th centuries, the dogs were noted for their muscular builds and athleticism. They were originally bred to fight with bulls, a terrible practice that was thankfully outlawed in 1835.  \n\nBy then, these affable pups had won the hearts of everyone with their cute, smooshed faces, so people continued to breed them just for their looks. They were brought to the U.S. shortly after, where the American Kennel Club recognized them as an official breed in 1886. The Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1898. \n\nThese days, English Bulldogs are definitely not athletic like their ancestors. They’re known for their friendliness, and their adorable faces continue to be popular symbols of pluck and determination: They’re mascots for many high schools and universities (including Yale and the University of Georgia), as well as the United States Marine Corps.  \n\nIf you’re thinking about bringing home your own English Bulldog puppy, work with a reputable breeder. And know that, because of their anatomy, English Bulldog health issues can be numerous, even with good breeding practice.    \n\nYou can also seek out English Bulldogs for adoption at breed-specific rescues like Adopt a Bull, keep an eye out at your local shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are English Bulldogs hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, English Bulldogs are not hypoallergenic dogs. While they aren’t heavy shedders, they tend to drool a lot, and that factors into the allergy-inducing equation."

      "question": "How long do English Bulldogs live?",
      "answer": "The English Bulldog lifespan tends to be between 8–10 years. Keep up with a good diet, regular exercise, and routine vet care to help them live their best life."

      "question": "Can English Bulldogs swim?",
      "answer": "Technically, most English Bulldogs could swim if they had to, but it’s not wise to put them in the water. Their short legs, short snout, and big head make it tricky for them to stay above water. Put them in a good lifejacket if you’re near water or on a boat."

      "question": "Do I need a special English Bulldog harness?",
      "answer": "It’s OK to put a collar on your English Bulldog to accessorize, but when it comes to walks and attaching a leash, you should choose a harness. Harnesses help flat-faced dogs breathe better by taking pressure off the windpipe."

      "question": "American vs. English Bulldog: What’s the difference?",
      "answer": "American Bulldogs are bigger than English Bulldogs—an American Bulldog can weigh from 60–100 pounds while English Bulldogs tend to top off at 50 pounds (for a male) or 40 pounds (for a female).  \n\nSome key differences are that English Bulldogs are more likely to get along with cats, while American Bulldogs would prefer a feline-free home; English Bulldogs tend to need less space; and English Bulldogs look like couch potatoes next to their sportier American cousins."

    {
      "question": "French Bulldog vs. English Bulldog: What’s the difference?",
      "answer": "French Bulldogs and English Bulldogs have a lot in common. They’re both looking for a devoted bestie who can give them all the attention they deserve. They’re also both very social and love to meet people when they’re out and about.  \n\nThey’re both brachycephalic dog breeds, but English Bulldogs will need more attention to their keeping their skin folds clean and dry when it comes to their health. Frenchies also tend to be smaller (weighing less than 30 pounds), while English Bulldogs are usually 40–50 pounds."
