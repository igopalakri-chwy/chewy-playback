  "breed_intro": "If your Saturday plans often involve serious outdoor adventuring, a Norwegian Elkhound may be the canine companion you're looking for. These silver-gray dogs hail from—you guessed it—Norway and are born athletes, always ready to tackle a day of outdoor adventure with you. Norway's national dog is a fierce, loyal, intelligent and ancient breed that requires lots of physical and mental stimulation. Daily exercise, training and possibly dog sports will be in your future, so feel free to cancel your Netflix subscription (and invest in a good vacuum) before you welcome your newest family member.",
  "appearance_description": "Typical Norwegian Elkhound physical traits include thick fur, pointy ears, slender muzzles and curled tails. Their heads are broad, and they're commonly mistaken for Siberian Huskies. However, Elkhounds' muzzles are black and get lighter over their heads, and they have a distinctive harness mark (a band of longer guard hairs from shoulder to elbow).",
  "temperament_description": "A Norwegian Elkhound's temperament is active and intelligent, strong-willed and devoted. These qualities make them a great family dog for an on-the-go crew who's up to the challenge.\r\n\r\nA typical Norwegian Elkhound is loyal and friendly, although they aren't quite as outgoing as a Labrador or Golden Retriever. They may take time to warm up to strangers, though they will generally come around. They aren't aloof like some breeds but don't always seek a new BFF. Their loyalty is to their pet parent first and foremost. Norwegian Elkhounds can cohabitate with other dogs, although it's best to introduce them to other dogs when they're young.\r\n\r\nElkhounds are historically hunting dogs, eager to track, chase and keep large animals at bay, so they tend to be quite vocal and won't hesitate to sound the bark alarm if they want to tell you something Very Important, like that a stranger's approaching or you're 10 minutes late with their dinner.",
  "care_description": "Norwegian Elkhounds require commitment. Their high energy demands a high activity level, and they must be well-trained or they may try to lead you. On top of that, daily brushing is a must for this double-coated breed, and they will shed their undercoat twice a year, sending your vacuum cleaner into overdrive.",
  "grooming_description": "The rugged Norwegian Elkhound breed has fairly average grooming needs, though they do shed a lot. They don't need to be regularly coiffed by a professional, but you do need to brush them daily. A few minutes a day will do wonders to offset any shedding woes for most of the year. You may find yourself brushing them more frequently in the spring and fall when they blow their coats—they shed it in chunks instead of individual hairs. You can do your best to keep tumbleweeds at bay by back-brushing (brushing backward from how their fur lays) with a slicker brush.\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of the Norwegian Elkhound is how their coats keep odors away. That said, they do need the occasional bath, though typically only two or three times annually (unless, of course, your hikes get particularly muddy); baths are beneficial every six months or so when your dog sheds their undercoat. Get expert tips on how to bathe a dog. Note: This breed should never be shaved, even in the summer. That double coat of theirs works as insulation, which helps keep them cool in the summer and warm in the winter and protects them from sunburn.\n\nTrim their nails as needed, which is usually monthly. If they're getting long, you'll hear the distinctive clickety-clack warning on hard surfaces.\n\nAs for their pearly whites, brush them daily. Start teeth brushing when your Elkhound is a puppy. The task will be much easier if they are used to it. Don't forget that an annual professional cleaning by your vet is vital for your doggy's dental health.",
  "training_description": "Patience is a virtue, as they say, and you have it in spades. That's good, as you'll need to tap into that well when it comes to training your Norwegian Elkhound. Training this breed is important but challenging (for both you and your pup), as these smart dogs sometimes like to think that they know what's best. (Spoiler: They do not.) Without guidance, they'll tend to make their own fun. (Spoiler: Hope you didn't want to wear that pair of shoes again—ever.)\n\nStart training your puppy with the basics, like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Because Elkhounds are intelligent, they're eager to learn as long as it's not routine. (Routine is so boooor-riiinnnng.)\n\nThe key is to keep your Elkhound mentally stimulated and make training fun. One way to do that is to use positive reinforcement training methods where you reward good behavior with treats, toys or praise. Pro tip: You may find the help of a certified dog trainer beneficial to keep things engaging and creative.\n\nSocialization is important, too, even for this naturally friendly breed. Start socializing your dog while they're a puppy and take them on walks to meet the neighbors (both two- and four-legged) and experience new places and things. You may also want to enroll them in puppy preschool, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and mix and mingle with adults all in one location.\n\nConsistency is key when training any dog, especially when teaching a super smart dog like the Elkhound breed. Work on obedience every day, don't switch commands up (i.e., using \"sit\" and \"place\" interchangeably), and don't give your pup a day where the rules don't apply. Inexperienced pet parents may quickly find themselves being trained rather than the other way around.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Norwegian Elkhounds, like most breeds, typically do well on a diet of high-quality commercial dog food. Always factor in your dog's age and choose a food that fits their stage in life, whether they are a puppy, adult or senior dog. Your veterinarian can help you choose the best food for your dog's lifestyle and provide a feeding chart or schedule to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog.\r\n\r\nAlthough Norwegian Elkhounds are active dogs, obesity is a concern for this breed. They love food and aren't likely to miss a meal. Expect them to let you know it's mealtime. Resist the urge to overfeed them or give them too many treats. Remember, treats equal calories and should make up no more than 10% of their daily diet. Always check with your vet for diet recommendations based on your pet's needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Because Norwegian Elkhounds were bred to hunt in the cold, rugged Nordic climate, they are high-energy dogs who don't need much persuasion to exercise. Today's Elkhounds and their pet parents aren't likely to be tracking moose, so it's important to give these dogs the physical and mental stimulation they need. Lack of activity can cause them to become anxious, frustrated and destructive. These dogs aren't suited to life as couch potatoes.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to exercise styles, Norwegian Elkhounds aren't really into lacing up their shoes and heading out for a run, and maybe you can relate. These medium-sized dogs are much better suited for exercise that feels like play—again, perhaps you relate—and their high exercise needs make them the ideal breed to enroll in various dog sports, depending on your—and your dog's—interests. Norwegian Elkhounds excel in activities like conformation trials (aka dog shows), agility, and bikejoring (it's like sled-pulling without the snow and uses bicycles).\r\n\r\nIf competition's not your thing, strenuous hikes will do the trick. Norwegian Elkhounds are known less for their speed and more for their stamina, so be bold and take a long trek—as long as they have the all-clear from your vet. At a minimum, ensure they get 20 to 30 minutes of exercise twice daily. Walking around the neighborhood might not be enough of a challenge for an Elkhound, so mix in tasks like scent work and opportunities for off-leash exercise in a well-fenced-in area. Without that fence, their natural hunting instincts may lead them to take off at first sight of a wandering critter, and no one needs to play chase around the neighborhood.",
  "ideal_environment": "Big house, little house—Norwegian Elkhounds can adapt to a variety of living environments. However, they are physically active dogs prone to barking and sometimes howling, so apartment living or small spaces can be a challenge if you prefer to keep the peace with neighbors and don't have the time to ensure your Norwegian Elkhound gets enough exercise. They are a northern breed, so they thrive in cold climates, but they can live in warm places, too. Just be sure to keep outdoor activity to the cooler parts of the day when it's hot out, and always make sure they have access to plenty of fresh, cool water.\r\n\r\nA fenced-in yard is ideal, although leaving an Elkhound to roam in the backyard all day isn't enough activity for them. They will get bored with what's in their space, potentially leading to mischief. Their activity level must go far beyond a yard and an occasional walk.\r\n\r\nNorwegian Elkhounds are good with kids and do best in an active family. This breed is typically OK with another dog in the home, especially if you introduce them to the other dog as a puppy.",
  "health_description": "Norwegian Elkhounds' life expectancy is 12 to 15 years. They are a generally sound breed with few health problems. But there are a few health issues to be aware of. Here are some of the other health issues you should be mindful of.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: A common problem in large breeds and older dogs, hip dysplasia occurs in some Elkhounds. Hip dysplasia is a condition in which the hip joint isn't formed properly and rubs, causing the dog pain. Symptoms include lameness in the back legs, decreased activity and \"bunny hopping.\" Treatment options include physical therapy, joint supplements, medications and potentially surgery.\nGenetic Eye Conditions: Several genetic eye conditions that lead to blindness occur in the breed, including progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma and cataracts. If your pup has any issues with their eyes (redness, cloudiness, squinting, bulging, running into things, pain), please see your veterinarian right away.\nRenal (Kidney) Disease: Norwegian Elkhounds may experience kidney problems, including Fanconi syndrome. Symptoms include excessive urination and thirst, as well as weight loss. There's no cure for kidney disease, but there are treatment options, including a prescription diet, medications and ensuring your dog always has access to plenty of fresh water.",
  "history_description": "The so-called “Dog of the Vikings,\" the Norwegian Elkhound has an origin that dates back further than even the Vikings themselves. What's believed to be skeletons and depictions of Elkhound-like dogs have been found among human remains at Stone Age archeological sites in Norway. They hunted with their Viking companions, who bred these fearless hounds for trailing and cornering big game like moose, reindeer and bears. They've also served as guardians and watchdogs, barking incessantly at threats that came their family's way. Their strong noses and barking abilities persist in the breed today.\r\n\r\nNorwegian Elkhounds became show dogs in their native country in the late 1800s. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1913. In 1931, the Norwegian Elkhound Association of America gifted an Elkhound puppy, named Weegie, to President Herbert Hoover after his German Shepherd died. At the time, there were only a couple dozen Elkhounds in the US, although they were more common in Europe. Today, they rank 97th out of 197 in AKC breed popularity.\r\n\r\nWhere can you find a puppy today if you are considering raising a Norwegian Elkhound? The AKC Marketplace lists puppies available from AKC-registered breeders. How much does a Norwegian Elkhound puppy cost? The price for a puppy from a reputable breeder ranges from around $1,000 to $2,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you're interested in adopting a member of this breed, several rescue organizations also specialize in Norwegian Elkhounds. You can also keep an eye out at your local animal shelters or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
