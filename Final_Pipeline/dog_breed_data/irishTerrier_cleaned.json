  "breed_intro": "She may be Scottish, but if \"Brave\" Disney princess Merida were magically transformed into a dog, she'd probably be an Irish Terrier. With a lust for life that will match your own fiery outlook, this clever breed will keep you in stitches with their plucky personalities as well as their loyal and loving ways. Like Merida (and you), their outgoing nature can sometimes be a tad too boisterous, but one look at their friendly face will melt your heart and forgive anything. Irish Terriers are just as happy playing tag (which they can do for hours) as they are to sniff every square inch of your neighborhood—as long you're around to accompany them. Ready for a lifetime of fun and adventure? Meet your new partner in crime.",
  "appearance_description": "Irish Terriers are sturdy but nimble, with smooth or shaggy coats, depending on how often they're groomed. With their long heads and confident gait, this medium pup is sure to stand out in any crowd. However, the most striking thing about them is their color: a beautiful, gold-tinted shade of auburn synonymous with the Emerald Isle. Their tail, if undocked, is long and thin; if docked, it sits high and proud. Their ears are particularly distinctive, flopping gently above their warm, inquisitive eyes.",
  "temperament_description": "Irish Terriers are rural-bred, country-fed go-getters who have successfully transitioned into fun-loving family pets over the years. They're a bold and curious breed who embrace every new challenge like a champ. Dog sports such as agility obstacle courses and interactive puzzle toys will be a hit with this pup, whose ancestors worked multiple jobs—from hunting small game to standing guard—with ease.\n\nThis friendly pooch craves recognition for good work and responds well to rewards, whether in the form of treats or a new toy. Irish Terriers are friendly and playful, making them great dogs for families with children, and while they can sometimes get a little rowdy, they aren't prone to biting. They tend to be barkers and diggers, though, particularly if they don't get enough stimulation in the form of play sessions and walks. So for a well-behaved dog, it's totally worth it to take an extra couple of spins around the block to burn off that high energy.\n\nWhile Irish Terriers are exceptionally compatible with kids, they're not as thrilled with dogs and cats in the house, especially if they feel if like they're invading their territory. On the plus side, their alert and observant qualities make them natural-born watchdogs with a powerful bark that would make any intruder think twice. And, like a true canine BFF, this bearded beauty likes to be the center of your world and will happily monopolize all your attention if you let them. All things considered, Irish Terriers are full of personality and are an even-tempered, manageable breed.",
  "care_description": "Activity, both physical and mental, may be priority No. 1 for busy bee Irish Terriers, but their intelligence, eagerness to please, moderate grooming needs and affectionate nature make them relatively easy to care for. Though they thrive in active family homes with kids but no other pets, their playful ways will fill your home—big or small—with love and laughter.",
  "grooming_description": "Irish Terriers have a beautiful red coat—but that doesn't mean you want to see it all over your couch. Fortunately, these dogs shed very little, so grooming is fast and easy. Here are some grooming tips for your Irish Terrier:\n\n \t• Brushing: For best results, brush them with a slicker brush or a medium-toothed comb two to three times a week. Show dogs are usually hand-stripped using a stripping knife three to four times a year to remove the dead hair, but companion pets can simply be clipped every four to six months (if you prefer a sleeker, less scruffy look, that is).\nBathing: The Irish Terrier breed doesn't need frequent bathing—in fact, too many baths can dry out their skin—so once every three months is more than is enough (unless, of course, they're fond of splashing around in the mud). You'll want to brush right before the bath, to get rid of any mats that may have formed in the fur.\nDental care: Brushing your Irish Terrier's teeth once a day with dog toothpaste will help prevent periodontal disease, but it's important to have a professional cleaning by your vet at least once a year, too.\nEar cleaning: Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nNail trimming: If you take your dog on long walks on the sidewalk or street, their nails will wear down naturally, but you still need to trim them every two to three weeks to make walking more comfortable. You'll hear the distinctive \"tip tap\" from their paws when their nails need a little tending to.",
  "training_description": "Irish Terriers are the toddlers of the dog world: strong-willed and energetic, adorable with a mind all of their own. The good news is that they're more determined than they are impatient, so they can definitely be trained.\n\nThis is a breed who requires mental stimulation in addition to regular exercise and chances for them to demonstrate their speed. The best training involves nose work, which lets them use their natural instincts to sniff out hidden objects, which they love! They're also keen on dog sports including agility courses and field trials. It's important to keep a watchful eye on these dynamos because they do need discipline to maintain a harmonious co-existence with their pet parents.\n\nIn general, dogs crave structure, and this is especially true for the Irish Terrier. In other words, don't wait until your bored pup digs enough holes in your yard for a mini-putt course before starting their obedience training, if possible with a certified trainer or behaviorist. Early socialization (introducing them to different people and experiences) is also essential for your Irish Terrier puppy, along with positive reinforcement over time. Positive reinforcement includes treats, toys and lots of praise to reward a pup for a job well done.\n\nWhile not as easy to train as a Golden Retriever, Irish Terriers can be a good choice for your first pet. As you train your pup, remember to focus on what your Irish Terrier does correctly, revel in the moment and take breaks before you both get frustrated. Positive reinforcement training is a great way to encourage good behavior without using coercion, which can stress a dog out.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A balanced Irish Terrier diet that includes high-quality commercial dog food is usually recommended. Before buying, remember to consider your dog's age and choose a formula befitting their particular stage in life, whether that's puppy, adult or senior.\r\n\r\nBecause they're so active, many Irish Terriers thrive on a high-protein diet made primarily with animal-based protein sources like chicken, turkey, salmon, duck or beef. Talk to your vet about the best type of food for your dog.\r\n\r\nLike with most breeds, weight gain is common as Irish Terriers age, but routine exercise and a healthy diet will help to keep them lean. Limit the number of treats you offer to your dog, rewarding them for good behavior with playtime instead. Remember to follow your veterinarian's feeding guidelines so your Irish Terrier isn't over, or under, fed. Always offer them plenty of water, too, so they stay hydrated after all that intensive exercise.\r\n\r\nFor optimum results, consult with your vet about your options, as they'll are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Without a doubt, Irish Terriers are energetic dogs who need a lot of exercise to keep them happy. Because they have working dog roots and are accustomed to hunting small prey, they crave that magical combination of physical activity and mental stimulation. To keep them content, alternate between a lively game of hide and seek or a round of fetch with the kids. For an ultimate treat, hide the ball under a blanket or a box—these doggies really love to dig!\n\nThe Irish Terrier's heightened intelligence means that if given the choice between a walk around the block or agility training (timed obstacle courses), they'll take the sportier option every time. Plan on exercising your Irish Terrier for at least 20-30 minutes two or three times a day. While it might seem like your whole life is consumed with tiring out your pup at first, don't worry; once you get into an exercise routine, your Irish Terrier will be relaxed, well-behaved and loyal for life. Plus, you'll enjoy all the healthy benefits of their high-energy lifestyle, too! Win-win.",
  "ideal_environment": "A house equipped with a dog-friendly Whac-A-Mole game would be Irish Terrier heaven (honestly, they'd try to catch those moles all night). Here on earth, however, this breed will be almost as excited about games of hide-the-toy-bunny or, really, any active pursuit.\r\n\r\nBecause Irish Terriers have a strong chase instinct, these pets need space to run around outside, so a fenced yard or access to outdoor areas is ideal. While their medium size makes them a decent option for small homes and apartments, keep in mind that their habitual bark may annoy the neighbors. So if you live in the country, all the better. Irish Terriers adore wide open spaces and farm life.\r\n\r\nOne thing to know about this breed—and terriers, in general—is that their personalities can be as fiery as their red hair. Because they love to hunt and chase, they'll probably not get along well with cats and larger dogs. To be safe, it's best to raise them as single pets. On the flip side, they love to play with kids and are loyal to their pet parents, so as long as they get enough exercise, Irish Terriers make awesome family pets.",
  "health_description": "The life expectancy of an Irish Terrier is 13-15 years. This is a strong, ancient breed and is generally healthy, though they are prone to a few health issues. With regular vet check-ups and your knowledge of what to watch out for, your pet can live a long and happy life. \r\n\n \t• Bladder Stones: Bladder stones can be genetic, and Irish Terriers are more` prone to them than other breeds. Buildup of cystine (an amino acid) can occur in the urine leading to bladder stones. Stones can be painful and make it difficult for your dog to urinate. Symptoms include blood in your dog’s urine or straining to pee. Depending on the type of stones, treatments can range from a special diet aimed at dissolving the stones to surgery to remove the stones. If your pet is ever unable to urinate, this is an emergency, so contact your vet immediately. \r\n \t• Hyperkeratosis: This is a relatively rare condition in which a dog’s footpads become hardened and can crack. Aside from a crusty and dry appearance, symptoms include limping, reduced activity and bleeding paw pads. While there is no cure, a genetic test has recently been developed to detect this condition. Your vet can help with a treatment plan to make your vet more comfortable.  \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: This often-genetic condition occurs when the ball and socket joint does not form properly resulting in lameness, pain and arthritis.  Treatment options typically include joint supplements, pain medication and, in severe cases, surgery.",
  "history_description": "In the rolling green fields of Ireland back in the late 1800s, Irish Terriers were as common as three-leaf clovers—and with that dense and wiry coat, even a couple hundred drizzly days a year never rained on this breed's parade. Originally bred as farm dogs, Irish Terriers quickly proved they had the brains and versatility to expand their resume, which they did in a big way by acting as watchdogs, hunting dogs and even transporting messages for the military and working as sentinels during World War I.\r\n\r\nIrish Terriers are one of the oldest terrier breeds and were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. The name \"terrier\" comes from the Latin word \"terra,\" or earth, because these dogs love to burrow and dig up rabbits and moles (but hopefully not your flower bed).\r\n\r\nCurious about their origin? Rumor has it the Irish Terrier may be a descendent of the Black and Tan Terrier, which is now extinct. Today, Irish Terriers have the trademark red coat that makes this breed so unique. While they originated in Ireland, these dogs were pretty popular in America in the 1920s, when they became the mascot of the University of Notre Dame \"Fighting Irish\" football team, a title the terriers held all the way until the '60s. No wonder this breed looks so proud!\r\n\r\nIf interested in having an Irish Terrier in your life, where do you start? You can find information on reputable breeders at the AKC's website. The average price of an Irish Terrier ranges from $1,500-$3,500, depending on the breeder. Buying from a reputable breeder means you're more likely to be getting a pup with pedigree papers and who has likely been screened for health and temperament issues. You can also get in touch with Irish Terrier rescue organizations to adopt one of these distinctive dogs or get in touch with your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
