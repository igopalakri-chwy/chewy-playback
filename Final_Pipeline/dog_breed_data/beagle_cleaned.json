  "breed_intro": "Ready for an adventure? Life with a Beagle will never be dull. Whether you choose a Beagle puppy or an adult Beagle dog, you'll definitely get your exercise on a regular basis with this high-energy breed! Be prepared to get to know your dog trainer very well, as this spunky breed is highly intelligent but has a great sense of smell and loves to follow their nose, so teaching them basic skills'especially to come when called'is a must. Beagles love to have a job to do, so pet parents may also get to learn something new, like scent work or even agility. They'll keep you on your toes, but fans of this cheerful, clever breed wouldn't have it any other way.",
  "appearance_description": "Beagles are small hound dogs with a short yet muscular stature, high tail and long, floppy ears. They have a gentle, pleading expression that can only be described as the definition of 'puppy dog eyes.\"",
  "temperament_description": "The Beagle's temperament is generally joyful, determined and adventurous. They're spunky dogs who typically get along well with others, and their curious personality means they love to play and explore.\r\n\r\nCouch potatoes they are not! In fact, they need a lot of exercise and thrive when given a job to do. They were originally bred to track and hunt game, and you'll often see them with their nose to the ground. At times they can be too driven by scents. Don't be surprised if they smell something interesting and take off!\r\n\r\nKnown for their intelligence, a bored Beagle may get themselves into trouble. Don't worry'Beagles are happy to tell you when they need more stimulation with their attention-getting vocalizations. A cross between a bark and a howl, the unmistakable Beagle \"baying\" is sharper than a bark but not as drawn out as a howl. Beagles love to join in when they hear other dogs howling or when they want to express themselves with their \"Beagle noises.\"\r\n\r\nAgility training, scent work or tracking classes might be good activities to explore with these smart, strong-willed dogs. (Psst, the National Beagle Club is a good resource for events and other activities for this breed.)\r\n\r\nWhile a Beagle puppy can be mouthy and chew things they shouldn't (just like any other puppy!), the Beagle breed isn't expected to have aggressive tendencies as an adult. These social, family dogs get along well with children and are great for active families. And since they were originally bred for hunting in packs, they also do well with other dogs, although they may need more time to adjust to cat households.",
  "care_description": "Beagles are always up for a good time. While that might sometimes translate into your pup being a little mischievous at times, raising a Beagle can be a fun and rewarding experience. That being said, it's always helpful to know what you're getting yourself into ahead of time, so the following Beagle information is our primer on the basics of caring for this sweet and gentle breed.",
  "grooming_description": "Part of the reason Beagles are so popular is because they are a fairly low-maintenance breed when it comes to grooming. Beagles have short-to-medium hair and shed seasonally in the spring and winter. They'll benefit from regular brushing during this time, which may mean you'll need to brush them a couple of times a week, or it may need to become part of your daily routine, depending on how much your Beagle sheds.\r\n\r\nThey usually only need a bath after a good romp in the mud or after following their nose into something messy. Dogs' toenails grow at different rates, but generally speaking, most dogs need their nails clipped every one to two months. A good rule of thumb is if your dog's nails touch the floor when they're standing, it's time for a trim.\r\n\r\nWhile many pet parents might associate long, floppy ears with ear infections and think they need extra cleaning, experts now believe ear infections are more related to allergies than the ear's anatomy. A monthly cleaning should do the trick to keep those ears clean, but to avoid over-cleaning, always make sure there is actually dirt in your Beagle's ears. (You should be able to see dirt specks when you lift their ears.) From there, add a few drops of dog ear cleaning solution, massage with a tissue or cotton ball'no cotton swabs allowed'then let your dog shake their head to dislodge anything that might be in there.\r\n\r\nBecause dental disease is an issue with the Beagle breed, it's recommended to brush your dog's teeth anywhere from two times a day to three times a week to stop plaque and tartar from building up. It may seem silly to brush a dog's teeth, but periodontal disease is serious business. It can lead to a loss of teeth and even more serious issues like heart, liver, and kidney disease. In addition to regular brushings at home, be sure to take your dog to the vet for professional dental cleanings.",
  "training_description": "As they've transitioned from being solely hunting dogs to members of a household, Beagles have earned a reputation for being difficult to train. While they can be distracted by every smell within a five-mile radius, this gentle breed shouldn't be trained with a heavy hand. They respond very well to positive reinforcement training and are treat-motivated. Encourage them to listen by making training fun, and before you know it, training sessions will be the highlight of their day'and yours, too!\r\n\r\nEven the best-trained Beagle may not be able to overcome their instinct to follow their nose, so training them to come when called is essential. Loose-leash walking is another skill that may take some time to master since they want to follow everything they smell in every direction (a typical Beagle trait). But teaching your dog when it's time to sniff and when it's time to walk can be very helpful. For example, training them to \"leave it\" and \"let's go\" when it's time to walk and \"okay\" or \"go sniff\" when they're allowed to sniff around.\r\n\r\nAs we've mentioned before, Beagles can be talkative. They're also very intelligent and can sometimes train their humans better than we can train them! To avoid inadvertently reinforcing their barking tendencies, ignore your Beagle when they are trying to get your attention by talking. Reward them with treats or attention when they quiet down. Even telling them \"no\" can be seen as giving them attention, so resist the urge.\r\n\r\nIt's always a good idea to take your dog to a basic training class or seek a certified trainer's help if you need a professional perspective.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best food for a Beagle is a complete-and-balanced formula that is age-appropriate. To determine whether a food is, in fact, complete and balanced, look on the package for a statement that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). You'll still want to talk to your veterinarian, who can help you determine the best dog food for your dog's unique needs, based on things like weight, activity level and age.\r\n\r\nBeagles come in two sizes, so their ideal weight varies from under 20 pounds for dogs up to 13 inches tall and 20 to 30 pounds for dogs 13 to 15 inches tall. The breed is very food-motivated and has a lot of energy, so if they are overfed and under-exercised, your Beagle may get too heavy. Beagles are already on the shorter and stockier side, but a dog at a healthy weight should have a defined waist and straight sides. If you look at them from above and you see a round potato, your dog is probably overweight. You should also be able to feel their ribs.\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about your Beagle being overweight, your veterinarian is your best resource. But you can also cut down on treats (or switch to something with fewer calories, such as frozen green beans) and slowly increase their exercise by taking a slightly longer walk each day until you build up to about an hour a day. These could be two shorter walks or one long walk. The good news is that exercise for your Beagle means exercise for you, too!",
  "exercise_description": "Beagles have a high energy level and need regular exercise'about an hour or so every day' or they may release their pent-up energy in way you don't approve of. Since they are driven by scent, nosework'where you train a dog to find a certain odor'can be a great option to help expend their energy. You can sign up for nosework classes, but this is easy to do at home, too. All you need to do is grab two to three boxes, put a treat under one of them and let your Beagle sniff it out. Always use the same box as the \"treat box\" and gradually make it more difficult by adding boxes, stacking them, hiding them around the house, etc.\r\n\r\nAgility classes are another great option that can help burn off that Beagle energy, but again, it's totally something you can set up in your backyard if you have the space. Just don't let your Beagle off-leash outside of the fenced yard because their instinct to follow a scent is so strong that you could end up with a runaway dog.\r\n\r\nIf you can't get outside for the day due to weather or limited time, try a game that exercises their mind. Play hide-and-seek, give them a puzzle toy, or practice those training skills!",
  "ideal_environment": "The ideal environment for a Beagle is with an active family who can give them plenty of exercise and extracurricular activities. Because of their higher exercise needs and tendency to bark and howl loudly, the breed may not make the best apartment dwellers. They're also not a dog you can put in the backyard and hope they entertain themselves'this intelligent breed needs interaction. Otherwise, they might bark excessively while running the fence line and chasing every squirrel. Not ideal for them, you or your neighbors!",
  "health_description": "Several health problems are commonly seen in Beagles. While you won't necessarily come across these in your dog, it's good to know what to keep an eye out for'from eye issues to joint concerns'so your Beagle can live their life as happy and healthy as possible.\r\n\r\n \tCherry Eye: Cherry eye is the common term for prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid. It's usually due to a weakness of the connective tissue that normally holds the gland in place, and appears as a pink or red bulge in the front corner of the eye. It is not usually painful but can be irritating for the dog, and often requires surgery to fix. It is not preventable and can happen to dogs at any age, but it most often occurs in dogs younger than 2 years old.\r\n \tIntervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): IVDD is a neurological condition that occurs when one or more of the discs found between the vertebrae of the spine slip or rupture, causing the disc material to press on the dog's spinal cord. It can be very painful, and your dog may be suddenly paralyzed or not able to use their back legs. Weight control is one important way to prevent this from happening.\r\n \tDental Disease: Beagles tend to experience more dental disease than other dogs their size. It's recommended to start dental care when they are puppies, as periodontal disease can lead to teeth loss and even more serious issues like heart, liver and kidney disease.\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition that occurs as a dog grows, causing the hip joints to develop improperly. The result is instability or looseness of the hip joint, and eventually leads to cartilage wear and degenerative arthritis over time. Arthritis can further lead to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, as well as pain. This condition is typically diagnosed with x-rays. Treatments range from the nonsurgical, like weight reduction and physical therapy, to surgical, depending on the severity. Because hip dysplasia has a genetic predisposition, affected dogs should not be bred.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: Luxating patella (kneecap) is a condition that occurs when the groove that holds the patella in position is too shallow, allowing the patella to escape its normal position when the knee joint bends and straightens. This condition is seen more commonly in smaller breeds and does not always cause discomfort. but it can lead to other painful problems, like torn cruciate ligaments, arthritis and more.\r\n \tEpilepsy: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects the brain and results in recurrent seizures. Epilepsy is diagnosed when all other causes of seizures have been investigated and ruled out. Epilepsy ranges in severity, with some dogs experiencing seizures very rarely and others as often as daily. Depending on the severity, medications are available to control the seizure activity.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs and is caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or atrophy. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through blood testing, so thyroid levels should be a normal part of screening bloodwork as Beagles age. This condition can be managed with medications.",
  "history_description": "While the breed's exact origins aren't exactly clear, reports of small hounds hunting hares in Britain date back as far as 55 B.C. As time went on, larger hounds were bred for tracking down deer, and smaller hounds were bred for rabbit hunting. Modern Beagles are most likely descendants of smaller hunting hounds from the 1500s. Around that time, Beagles became popular as 'foot hounds,\" meaning that'unlike with larger hound breeds'one could hunt with a pack of Beagles on foot instead of on horseback.\r\n\r\nBeagles arrived in the United States after the Civil War, and 'Blunder\" was the first Beagle recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. The breed has always been popular among rabbit hunters and is one of the most popular dog breeds among families today, ranking as the seventh-most-popular dog by the AKC.\r\n\r\nLooking to make a Beagle part of your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. Working with a reputable breeder usually means you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health issues and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Beagle price can range from $350 to $1,500, with an average of about $500 to $850. Propsective pet parents can also adopt from Beagle rescue groups, keep an eye out for the breed at their local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area. .",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are Beagles hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Beagles are not hypoallergenic. Like many working dogs, the breed has a double coat, which means they have a soft undercoat and coarse outercoat. This helps keep them warm but also means they shed seasonally in the spring and winter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Beagles bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Beagles are known for barking and howling to express themselves. Keeping your Beagle busy and ensuring they get enough exercise is the best way to reduce their vocalizations. You can also train them to learn 'quiet\" as a command, but controlling their environment will help (not leaving them alone in the yard for long periods, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Beagles good with cats?",
      "answer": "Beagles may require some training to learn they aren't supposed to chase cats. If a puppy grew up around the cat, it probably would be fine. But bringing in an older Beagle where they've never had a cat might take a little bit of work."
