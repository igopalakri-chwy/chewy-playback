  "breed_intro": "If you’re the kind of family who can’t wait to pack up for a weekend camping trip, you’re going to love the Bernese Mountain Dog. These pups live for the weekends, when the great outdoors calls their name and they sprint outside. It’s not that they have unlimited energy or even a lot of energy by canine standards—they just don’t like to be bored.  \n\nThese easygoing pups radiate friendliness, from their big smile to their animated eyes to their fluffy, always-wagging tail. Bernese Mountain Dogs just want to make you happy.",
  "appearance_description": "Bernese Mountain Dogs—aka Berners—have playful brown eyes and a deservedly proud gait that gives them a noble air. Don’t let that fool you, though; they’re big softies at heart.  \n\nTheir thick, distinctly marked tri-color coat is mostly black, with white markings and rust-colored highlights. Their bushy tail is ready to wag whenever they see you.",
  "temperament_description": "Berners are great pets, partly due to their adoring temperament—yes, they’re pretty much obsessed with you, and they’d like the sentiment returned.  \n\nThese are not dogs who want to be left to do their own thing in the yard when you let them out, so grab a ball and play a game of fetch if they’re into it. Berners love to explore, so take them with you on adventures outside the neighborhood, too. After a hike or trip to the dog park, they love nothing more than cuddling up with you. \n\nThese dogs are smart and eager to please, and they thrive with structured games or sports. Although they’re not a high-energy dog like the Border Collie, Bernese Mountain Dogs still need consistent daily exercise. They typically love agility courses and scent walks. \n\nAlthough the Bernese Mountain Dog’s size makes them big and strong, they’re also gentle and kind. These patient dogs are good with children, provided that both children and pups are taught how to behave around each other.  \n\nLike many dogs, Berners might be shy around strangers or in new situations, so give them time to adjust. It’s helpful to socialize them as puppies, or as early as you can if you adopt a Bernese Mountain Dog.",
  "care_description": "Berners are known for their patience, but they still need socialization. They also need lots of brushing, especially when the seasons change in the spring and fall.  \n\nThese pups thrive with mental and physical exercises, so get them involved in dog sports and other fun activities. But Bernese Mountain Dogs’ thick coats can make hot weather tough; make sure they don’t overexert themselves and that they have access to AC and cold water during the summer.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Bernese Mountain Dogs need a bath every couple of months, as long as they don’t take a spill in the mud.  \nBrushing: The Bernese Mountain Dog has a thick, double coat that sheds a lot. Brush your pup three to four times a week to keep tangles and shedding manageable. \r\n\n\t• Like many double-coated dog breeds, Berners undergo “coat blowing” in the spring and fall. They shed their undercoat as the weather turns warmer, then they shed their lighter coat when the temps start to cool. Brush your Berner multiple times a day during these seasons.  \r\n\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth daily. A vet can point you to the best tooth-brushing supplies and techniques. Get your dog’s teeth professionally cleaned once a year. \nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails every two weeks or anytime they start to touch the floor when the dog is standing (too-long nails may be painful). You’ll hear when it’s time—they’ll make clacking noises on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Socialize your Bernese Mountain Dog puppy early (or as early as possible if you adopt them as an adult). An adult Berner can be 100 pounds or more, so it’s important for them to learn good manners.  \n\nThe Bernese Mountain Dog is very smart and also eager to please. When you train them, use positive reinforcement—that is, treats, toys, and praise; as with all dogs, negative reinforcement can have poor consequences and do a lot more harm than good. Your Berner will probably love clicker training. They’re bright enough to learn almost anything you want to teach them.   \n\nIf you’d like some help, a certified dog trainer who uses positive reinforcement can work with you and your Bernese Mountain Dog puppy.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Bernese Mountain Dog, but every pup needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Also choose a formula that’s made for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Bernese Mountain Dog puppies need a puppy food designed for large breeds to support their super-fast growth spurts.   \n\nYour vet is your best resource when choosing food for your dog. They can give you portion guidance, too, so you don’t overfeed your Berner.  \n\nDon’t forget to calculate treats into your pup’s daily meal plan—too many goodies can make your dog pack on harmful extra weight. Treats should never make up more than 10% of your Bernese Mountain Dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "The Bernese Mountain Dog craves activities that satisfy them mentally and physically. Take them for at least one 30- to 60-minute walk every day, and give them time to sniff and explore the world around them while out and about. \n\nBerners have moderate energy levels, so don’t keep them cooped up all day. When they get outside, they prefer to do their “workouts” with you, their exercise buddy. But if you’re a marathon runner, your own wellness routine should include time exercising with your fluffy workout partner. \n\nBerners love dog sports, structured games, playing fetch, and other challenging activities. Consider getting your Berner involved in scent work or agility trials.",
  "ideal_environment": "Bernese Mountain Dogs are best-suited for cold climates and adore playing in the snow. They can, however, adapt to warmer environments if they have access to air-conditioning. In hotter months, schedule outdoor time in the early morning or in the evening when it’s cooler, and pay attention to signs of overheating. \n\nBerners love playing with you in the yard, but they don’t need tons of outdoor space in their own home to be happy. They can live in an apartment, but you’ll need to take your Berner for a little adventure (like a neighborhood jaunt) every day. \n\nThey make good family pets and do well with other pets and kids. However, dogs younger than 4 years old may need supervision around kids or cats; it takes them time to realize their own strength and they might accidentally knock someone down during playtime. But overall, a well-socialized Bernese Mountain Dog is sweet and thrives in busy homes where they’ll find plenty of outlets for their energy and inquisitive mind. \n\nWhat Berners crave the most, though, is love, attention, and playtime. Make sure that you show up for them every single day, and they’ll be happy.",
  "health_description": "The typical Bernese Mountain Dog lifespan is 7–10 years. However, there are some health issues pet parents should be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Bernese Mountain Dogs, like many large breeds, are prone to a life-threatening condition called bloat. It occurs when the stomach fills with air or food. A serious complication of bloat is when the stomach twists on itself, cutting off blood supply to the organs. This is called GDV, and symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately. \r\n\n\t• You can take steps to prevent bloat and GDV: Feed your dog multiple smaller meals throughout the day, use slow-feeder bowls, and talk to your vet about a preventative gastropexy procedure. \r\n\nCancer: Histiocytic sarcoma is an aggressive cancer that’s thought to be genetic, as higher rates are seen in Bernese Mountain Dogs. Symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Unfortunately, the prognosis is usually poor. \nDegenerative myelopathy (DM): This is a neurological disease that affects the spinal cord; it slowly weakens, then paralyzes the back legs, and it causes problems with breathing, vocalizing, and eating. There is no treatment to reverse DM, but physical therapy may help.  \nEar infections: Bernese Mountain Dogs are predisposed to ear infections. Symptoms include head shaking, redness, or swelling in the ear canal, as well as itchiness or odor. Prevent ear infections by keeping ears clean and dry, especially after a bath or swim.  \nElbow and hip dysplasia: Like many large breeds, Berners can develop elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia, where the joint doesn’t work properly. Treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or (in severe cases) surgery. \nEye issues: Bernese Mountain Dogs can develop cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, and entropion. Give your vet a call if you notice changes in your dog’s eyes.  \nVon Willebrand’s disease: Bernese Mountain Dogs are susceptible to von Willebrand’s disease, a disorder where the blood doesn’t clot properly. Your veterinarian can test your dog for this.",
  "history_description": "Bernese Mountain Dogs originated in Switzerland, where they herded cows, pulled carts, and worked as guardian dogs on farms, according to the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of American. They were bred to have a thick, insulated coat that could keep them warm even in the freezing Swiss Alps. \n\nThanks to the Industrial Revolution, these pups retired from farm life. When their numbers diminished in the 1800s, Swiss breeders decided to repopulate them with the help of Professor Albert Heim, a distinguished Swiss geologist. \n\nA Kansas farmer brought the first two Berners to the U.S. in 1926, which skyrocketed their popularity. The first Bernese Mountain Dog was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1937.  \n\nThese dogs are closely related to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. There are actually four varieties of Swiss mountain dogs, but only Berners have a silky, longer coat. \n\nA Bernese Mountain Dog puppy can cost anywhere from $800 to $2,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also adopt a Bernese Mountain Dog, as many of these pups are waiting for forever homes. Reach out to a Bernese Mountain Dog rescue, such as the National Bernese Mountain Dog Rescue Network, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter or on their social media, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
