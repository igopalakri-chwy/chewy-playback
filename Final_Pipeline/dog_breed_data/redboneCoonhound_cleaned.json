  "breed_intro": "The spectacularly-singular song stylings of the Redbone Coonhound (the baying! the howling!) and a \"let's be friends\" invitation for everyone they meet (along with a sometimes just a bit naughty need to pursue whatever scent they catch in the air) make this handsome hound a special sort of companion. They run, they hunt, they love their peeps with unmatched devotion—they are a multi-hyphenate who is a scene-stealer when you are out and about. If you are up for the challenge of a speed-racer with a big, loud personality who is also an unapologetic oversized lap dog, and you can hang tough when faced with that famous pleading, hangdog expression, this hound can be your ideal pooch.",
  "appearance_description": "A Redbone Coonhound dog's watchful eyes, busy nose and alert tail lets you know they've found something exciting that needs tracking down. And their solid red coat gleams while their ears and jowls flop wildly as they zip along at a high speed ready to catch up to the scent they've tracked.",
  "temperament_description": "The Redbone breed is super friendly and will greet all your guests at the door—and they're likely to lay down and roll over so their new friends can pet their belly instead of their head. Redbones love to be with their people; they may be independent thinkers and led by their nose, but they're not loners. It's best if you can be with them for most of the day, or arrange for a play day at doggy daycare or ask a friend to stop by. Otherwise, they may sing the sad song of their people all day (by baying) or destroy things in the house while you're gone.\n\nThese energetic pups love to play, and they'll be good playmates for kids, especially older ones; in their exuberance, they may accidentally knock over smaller children. So, be sure to supervise playtimes with kids and your Redbone.\n\nThese red dogs aim to please, but they have a powerful nose and can get distracted by scents. Redbones have been described as impulsive, unpredictable, independent and fast. All these traits hail from their hunting instincts; it's important to keep your Redbone on a leash when out and about. Starting their training while they're a puppy and ensuring they get plenty of exercise will help curb these activities. (Although you'll never completely train these instincts out of your pup.)\n\nRedbones can be laser-focused when they catch an interesting scent, and they'll do whatever it takes to track it down. They're clever escape artists who can figure out how to get over, under or around fences to get where they want to go. You might find a GPS tracker helpful in case your four-legged Houdini gets out of your backyard.\n\nRedbone Coonhound dogs get along well with other dogs, especially those who can match their energy level, like a Border Collie. And if you raise your Redbone with a cat from puppyhood, they'll likely get along. But their instincts will kick in around small animals that look like critters that need chasing, and they may give in to the urge.\n\nRedbone Coonhounds aren't aggressive, but their enthusiasm may look like aggression to people unfamiliar with the dog. They may lunge, bark, jump and dance to get what they want—for example, to chat with the Poodle across the street. But with proper training, socialization and plenty of exercise, your Redbone can be a polite member of society. Redbones are not biters, either, but it's important to teach them not to bite while they're puppies. As born hunters, they don't retrieve with a gentle mouth, like a Labrador Retriever, and they may \"play bite\" harder than you'd like.\n\nRedbone Coonhounds are working dogs, meaning they were bred with a job to do. These pups love being put to work! Whether that's a formal job, like search and rescue or activities with a purpose like dog sports (i.e., tracking) or even games of hide-and-seek can help scratch their itch for work.",
  "care_description": "A Redbone Coonhound is easy to care for, but don't neglect the basics, like brushing your pup, to keep them happy, healthy and clean. It all just gives you more time to bond with your dog over training and exercising—two things you'll be doing a lot of.",
  "grooming_description": "Thanks to their short coats, a Redbone Coonhound's grooming needs are a snap compared to other breeds. However, they do have a double coat and shed frequently, and you'll need to brush them once a week with a shedding blade and a bristle brush. These are best for their slick, short coats—not wire brushes—and will help maintain a lovely shine. They have a musty smell and a lot of oils on their back, which can transfer to other surfaces and leave stains. Regular brushing (and bathing) can help redistribute the oils. While you're brushing your dog, check their ears for signs of infection, like redness or swelling, and contact your vet if you see anything unusual. Your vet may recommend you clean your dog's ears.\n\nIf your red-colored dog is extremely active with outdoor activity, they may need a bath every week. Otherwise, plan on bathing your pup once every four to six weeks. Always keep their ears dry since their heavy ears aren't well ventilated and can be a breeding ground for nasty germs.\n\nRedbones need their teeth brushed daily. Work up to daily brushing, if possible. It's best to start when your Redbone Coonhound's a puppy, so they'll get used to it. Poor dental hygiene can cause tooth loss and a host of other medical problems. They also need an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not a groomer).\n\nNails should be trimmed every four to six weeks. You'll know they're ready for a trim when you can hear them clacking on your kitchen floors.",
  "training_description": "The Redbone breed is an intelligent dog who is eager to please you. But they're just as eager to find whatever interesting scent crosses their nose. It's important to start training your Redbone Coonhound puppy while they're young to help direct those instincts in proper directions.\n\nBasic obedience training teaches your puppy commands like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Leash training is important to the health of your shoulder—once fully grown, these dogs are strong, and they'll take you for a walk (really, a run) if they take off after a squirrel.\n\nTo help get the most out of your dog's intelligence and keep you both from getting frustrated during training, keep your sessions short, like 10 minutes at a time, and reward your pup with treats, praise and playtimes with special toys when they do a good job. A Redbone Coonhound puppy needs a confident and calm leader who understands that patience is the key to successful training. They will be distracted by what's happening around them, and this can be frustrating to first-time pup parents.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Redbone Coonhound dog typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) that's suitable for large-breed dogs. Look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\r\n\r\nTreats can be handy rewards for training your Redbone, but give them in moderation, so they don't pack on the pounds. Obesity can lead to other health problems like diabetes and joint conditions. If you notice your pup gaining weight, chat with your vet. They can help you put together a diet and exercise plan to help your dog lose the extra weight and still get the nutrition they need.",
  "exercise_description": "To say that Redbone Coonhounds need tons of exercise is pretty much an understatement. They have to be able to run a lot. It's in their DNA as hunting dogs, and they can get very frustrated and destructive if they don't have an avenue to really speed around the yard. They need at least an hour or two of exercise every day. Too much idle time means they'll create their own activities, and that might mean you come home to find your flower beds in disarray or a new hole in a bedroom door.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are plenty of ways to make sure they get to expend all their energy. If you enjoy running, lace up your sneakers and take your Redbone with you. Take them on a couple of long walks every day and hit the nature trails on the weekends. These dogs are great at dog sports, so if you enjoy some friendly competition, get involved in agility or tracking. Create opportunities to track at home by hiding treats under old Chewy boxes or play hide-and-seek with your pup.\r\n\r\nBecause these dogs are born to hunt with their nose, never let them off-leash outside of an enclosed area, like a fenced backyard. This pup will catch a scent, and they're off to the races. They're focused and fast and won't look both ways before crossing a street. For your sanity and their safety, always keep your pup on a leash.",
  "ideal_environment": "A Redbone Coonhound is a great fit for active and experienced pet parents who enjoy activities like running and hiking. They need a spacious, fenced-in yard (a physical fence, not an underground electronic one), so they can be off-leash and run to release their energy. They were bred to run, not walk, so it's something they really need to do every day.\r\n\r\nThis breed loves children, but if you have small kids, you'll want to supervise their playtime together; Redbones are bouncy and can knock small children and toddlers down easily without even realizing it. They love being with their people, and they don't like being left alone for long. Ideally, someone should be with them for most of the day. These dogs are also very vocal; this, coupled with their large size and need for space, makes living in small spaces like apartments or condos a challenge.\r\n\r\nIf they've been socialized with other pets from a young age, they'll likely get along and not see them as something to be chased. They love being the life of the party and getting tons of attention, so jealous types be warned: Redbones are equal-opportunity lovers when it comes to scritches from guests in the home. This makes them lousy guard dogs, but their loud, baying bark will make them quite effective watchdogs.",
  "health_description": "Redbone Coonhounds have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years and are prone to fewer health conditions than other dog breeds. However, it’s important for pup parents to be aware of the health problems they may experience so you can help your pup live the happiest and longest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Hip and elbow dysplasia are caused when the joint is malformed and rubs, causing the dog pain. Symptoms include limping, reduced activity and muscle loss. Treatments range from dietary and other lifestyle changes to surgery, depending on the severity of the dysplasia.\nPanosteitis: To help prevent bone and joint problems like panosteitis, an inflammation of the bone causing pain and lameness, Redbone Coonhound puppies should be fed large-breed puppy food. Panosteitis can also be treated with medications, including anti-inflammatory drugs. Dogs should be given time to recover, with limited activity in order to help keep pain to a minimum.\nCoonhound Paralysis: Redbone Coonhounds exposed to raccoon bites or saliva may contract coonhound paralysis, an immune reaction to raccoon saliva that inflames the dog’s nerves. It can affect their gait and breathing. Take your pup to the vet immediately if you are concerned about coonhound paralysis.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) causes gradual vision loss. Night blindness can be an early symptom of the disease, which isn’t curable. However, most dogs don’t have a problem adapting to vision loss. A genetic screening test is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "With a history stretching back to the red foxhounds brought by Scottish immigrants to the Southeastern United States, the Redbone Coonhound has earned their reputation as a hard-working hunting dog with incredible levels of endurance. The early ancestors of the dog were red with black saddles on their backs (a patch of color that looks like a horse saddle), but the saddle was eventually bred out, leaving the dog we see today with their solid-red coats. The breed was originally bred to hunt raccoons and foxes in Tennessee and Georgia and became very skilled at treeing raccoons. In packs, the Redbone Coonhound also hunted big game animals like bobcat and bear.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Redbone Coonhound in 2009. While not widely popular as a pet, they are incredibly popular with hunters and farmers. With such a powerful sense of smell and tracking ability, they also excel at helping find missing people.\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find Redbone Coonhound puppies today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average price for a puppy? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $800 to $1,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Redbone Coonhound rescue organizations to adopt a Redbone, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
