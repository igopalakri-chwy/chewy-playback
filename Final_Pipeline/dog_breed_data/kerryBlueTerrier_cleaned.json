  "breed_intro": "If you look up the word \"feisty\" in a dictionary, you might just find a pic of the Kerry Blue Terrier. These smart cookies think life is a full-contact sport that you shouldn't just observe from the sidelines. Unless it's a night in, they're game for whatever you've got planned (fetch, games, or even hiking ... it's all good in a Kerry Blue's world). Kerries are full of life and are ready to be your partner in crime—if you're prepared to plan the adventures.",
  "appearance_description": "With a famous wavy blue coat, deep chest and muscular frame, the Kerry Blue Terrier breed is a compactly built working dog. Their distinct beard may lend a scholarly air, but this animal's preferred venue is a down-and-dirty farm life. These medium-sized dogs sport keen eyes and a compact, erect tail, giving them an air of alert readiness for life's adventures.",
  "temperament_description": "The Kerry Blue Terrier temperament is alert and intelligent, with a capable, strong-willed approach to work and play. Like other terriers, they tend to be fearless, energetic, mischievous and tenacious (yes, they can be a handful!). A potential Kerry pet parent must bear in mind that this tough-as-nails former hunting and guard dog was bred to work at singular tasks, which can make Kerry Blue Terrier training somewhat challenging, though still achievable.\r\n\r\nRaising a Kerry Blue Terrier as a family pet is a fine idea as long as early and consistent training is on the schedule. They don't enjoy being left alone for long, so if you work outside the home, you may want to sign up for doggie daycare or enlist the aid of a dog sitter or neighbor to stop by for some playtime. Supervise small children around a new dog, as you should with every dog breed.\r\n\r\nThe Kerry Blue Terrier is friendly and playful on the whole, but when it comes to other dogs and cats in the home, they don't play nice with others. Alas... With that in mind, Kerry Blue Terriers are happiest when they're the (sole) animal pack leader and your only pet.\r\n\r\nAs all-purpose working terriers, the Kerry Blue held many past positions, including livestock herder, sheep guardian and CEO in charge of removing any and all vermin, such as mice, otters, badgers and hares. Today's Kerry Blue Terrier characteristics feature high energy and a lively manner, making this breed a lovely canine companion for the get-up-and-go set.",
  "care_description": "A Kerry Blue Terrier's blue coat needs diligent care to keep it looking sharp, and you'll spend lots of time training and exercising your loveable pup.",
  "grooming_description": "A Kerry Blue Terrier's coat maintenance is high compared to other breeds, which means a potential Kerry parent will need to set aside some time every week to brush and comb their fur well to prevent mats and tangles from forming.\n\nThe best tools for Kerry Blue grooming include a comb and slicker brush for removing loose hair and scissors or electric clippers for trimming the head, neck, ears and belly fur. You can also give your Kerry's beard a haircut if you like (overly long whiskers get wet and splatter when Kerries drink).\n\nYour best bet? Visit an experienced groomer for some clipping tips before you start to trim. And get a complete professional grooming every six to eight weeks.\n\nA monthly bath is a good goal for your Kerry, as is a weekly nail trim and a twice-monthly ear cleaning. You can ask your vet for help with these tasks, including which cleansers work best. Fortunately, Kerry Blue Terrier shedding is extremely low, so clean-up around the house should be minimal.\n\nDon't forget your Kerry's pearly whites! Brush your dog's teeth every day using a toothpaste made for dogs. Schedule your Kerry Blue Terrier puppy for professional teeth cleaning by the vet every year. Again, your pet's vet can give you brushing pointers so you can keep those canines plaque-free.",
  "training_description": "When you start to train your pup, you'll appreciate the Kerry Blue Terrier's innate intelligence. Kerries are smart dogs and love to engage with their family, whether competing in a race, sitting for a treat, or following other obedience commands. Still, take note of the headstrong nature that's a key Kerry Blue Terrier trait. The same toughness that enables terriers to track and hunt vermin can also make them somewhat stubborn during training. But you're headstrong, too, right? So it's all good. That's why you two will get along.\r\n\r\nA good Kerry strategy is to keep your training methods positive and consistent. Consider a puppy training class with a canine expert with deep terrier breed knowledge. Training young in puppyhood is also essential as Kerry Blue Terrier puppies need proper socialization to adjust to family life at home. Take your pup on walks to meet new dogs and other people and enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet other pet parents in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Determining your Kerry Blue Terrier's food needs is easy if you stick to high-quality commercial dog food and remember to factor in your dog's age. Read food labels carefully, so you pick the one that fits the correct stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nAsk your vet about a feeding chart if you have questions or concerns about your dog's diet. A clear plan can indicate how much food to serve and how often.\r\n\r\nAs for treats, every pet parent loves to give them, and offering tasty nuggets is an important training enhancement. Still, don't lavish your Kerry with too many, as this practice can lead to excessive weight gain. Lastly, water is important for good health, so always keep a bowl of fresh H2O on hand for your pet.",
  "exercise_description": "The Kerry Blue Terrier exercise needs are on the high side, so plan on taking your pet outside for at least two walks a day for 30 minutes each—and possibly a third if you're an apartment dweller without a yard out back for your dog to romp in. Because the Kerry Blue Terrier's energy level is also high, one daily outing should consist of active exercise such as playing fetch, jogging in the park or chasing the pet parent around in a circle. Hope you don't get dizzy much!\r\n\r\nAs a former working animal, the Kerry Blue Terrier's speed is innate, making the breed a good candidate for a canine agility course, scent games (hide a toy with a treat tucked inside!) or even dock diving if you have access to a lake, pond or pool. Multi-sport days may be in order to keep these Kerry Blue Terrier types thoroughly entertained.",
  "ideal_environment": "A Kerry Blue Terrier's qualities thrive in a home with active, exercise-loving pet parents who are willing to put up with some strong-willed behavior as they work to train. Combining a Kerry Blue Terrier dog with kids goes well if early socialization and obedience lessons are also in place, but this terrier might not be as accepting of other canines and cats as they are of children (thanks to their history as hunters). So, if you plan to have more than one pup in your home or love to foster kittens, skip over the Kerry in favor of another breed.\r\n\r\nOutdoor space is a major bonus when considering adding the Kerry Blue into your life, partly because it's easier for this animal to get the exercise they need right out the back door. But if you live in an apartment or small home with a little grass to play on, you can still keep this dog happy with an extra walk a day or by engaging in some fun doggie training exercises.\r\nKerries do best with experienced pet parents since terriers aren't typically super easy to teach to sit and heel. But if you're terrier-savvy and know what to expect, a Kerry might suit you and your living situation.",
  "health_description": "Kerry Blue Terrier Health \n\nA Kerry Blue Terrier has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. Their health issues aren’t usually extensive, but like any breed, certain conditions may develop over time. Here’s more about each one: \n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: A genetic malformation of the hip can cause the ball of the joint to be ill-positioned in the socket, resulting in dysplasia. You may notice limping and pain, which can develop into arthritis. Treatment options range from weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, and surgery in severe cases. \n \t• Eye Conditions: Cataracts may occur in an older Kerry, which appear as opacity of the eye’s lens. A veterinary ophthalmologist can often remove a dog’s cataracts surgically. Your Kerry may also develop dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), which is when the tear glands don’t produce enough tears. Sore, itchy eyes are often the result, but your vet can perform a test to confirm. Treatment is usually eye ointment.  \n \t• Neurological Disorders: Degenerative myelopathy is a progressive neurological condition that disrupts normal communication between the brain and limbs. While no cure is available, a genetic screening test is available for DM in dogs. Another similar disorder, known as progressive neuronal abiotrophy, can affect a Kerry’s gait and balance and eventually result in the inability to walk. \n \t• Blood Conditions: Hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are blood disorders that cause the immune system to attack the dog’s red blood cells or platelets. Dogs with this anemia type have weakness, lethargy and whitish or yellow gums; dogs with a platelet issue have blood that won’t clot properly. Treatment for either is typically with steroids, immune-suppressive drugs and transfusions. Kerry Blues can also have a deficiency in clotting factor XI, which can be detected by genetic screening tests.  \n \t• Inflammatory Bowel Disease: IBD is an immune disorder that affects the intestinal lining, causing chronic diarrhea and vomiting. While it may flare and subside, medication and special diets are typically needed to treat IBD. \n \t• Hypothyroidism: Too little thyroid hormone means your dog may exhibit a dry coat and skin, hair loss, weight gain and behavioral changes. Daily oral medication is most often the treatment for this condition.",
  "history_description": "The Kerry Blue Terrier's history begins with an old Irish tale that centers on County Kerry, from which these dogs get their name. Also known as the Irish Blue Terrier for apparent reasons, the true Kerry Blue Terrier origin is a bit of a mystery. Some believe Irish laborers bred the Kerry in response to the much larger, noble-class-favored Irish Wolfhounds. And while the Wolfhound's job was to keep illicit hunters off of their masters' property, the more stealth, diminutive Kerry Blue Terrier allowed those laborers to poach game on these same noble grounds.\r\n\r\nThere's also evidence that the Kerry Blue's original role was that of a utility terrier on the farm. Stepping in to help in myriad ways, this dog hunted down pesky creatures like rats, rabbits and badgers and aided in guarding and herding livestock such as cattle and sheep. In England and their native Ireland, the breed also assisted in hunting small game and birds, retrieving them from the land and water once the hunters hit their marks.\r\n\r\nThe Kerry Blue Terrier has a patriotic streak as a mascot for those who strove for Irish independence. The breed first came to North America in 1918 and started to appear in various dog shows in the early 1920s. Today's Kerry Blue is still well-equipped to find a mouse in the house, but most pet parents set up a comfy dog bed near the fireplace so their beloved companion can relax instead.\r\n\r\nIf you're considering this blue-coated dog, which the American Kennel Club recognized in 1922, keep in mind that Kerry Blue Terrier prices tend to range between $2,000 to $2,500 for puppies. To find a puppy, check out the reputable breeders of the Kerry Blue Terrier at the AKC Marketplace. You can also reach out to Kerry rescue organizations to adopt a Kerry, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs near you.",
