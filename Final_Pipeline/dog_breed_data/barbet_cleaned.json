  "breed_intro": "Barbet (pronounced bar-BAY) are a rare French water dog breed (How rare? There are about 1,000 registered with the American Kennel Club) who love three things: you, the water and making new friends. And they may just pass out if the day's adventure includes all three! These high-energy pups are up for a hike near a stream or some time at the beach with a game or two of Frisbee thrown in. If you're ready to play, explore and entertain, you've found your perfect companion.",
  "appearance_description": "With their curly hair and long, fluffy tail, the Barbet breed is named after their distinctive beard (the French word, barbe). Their inquisitive eyes that peep out through their fur seem to stare deeply into your soul. And their coat comes in a variety of colors—black, brown, fawn, white and gray—and can have white or pied markings, which is a mix of two or more colors.",
  "temperament_description": "The Barbet dog's personality is friendly and sociable. They'll try to make friends with everyone they meet—both two- and four-legged newcomers. The breed is not known for aggressive or biting traits, especially when you are dedicated to training and socializing your Barbet puppy. Barbet are also not terribly barky, so they'll alert you when someone's at the door, but they won't bark at every leaf that blows up onto the doorstep.\n\nWith their high energy level, they make great playmates for kids and do well with other dogs. And they're likely to get along with cats if raised together from puppyhood. However, they were bred to be bird dogs, so they don't mix well with birds in the home.\n\nThis intelligent breed aims to please their family but can get into trouble when bored. Mental stimulation and regular exercise is essential to keeping your Barbet a well-behaved member of the family. (You weren't planning on using your new kicks as a chew toy for your puppy, were you?)\n\nThe Barbet dog was bred to be a solid and strong hunter and tireless swimmer—they have the webbed feet to prove it! They've even earned the nickname \"Mud Dog\" because they so often find themselves drawn towards mucky, swampy water.\n\nTheir social nature extends to exercise time. Don't plan on putting your pup out in the backyard by their lonesome—running around by themselves won't cut it for this breed! Barbets enjoy a variety of activities from running and swimming to dog sports like agility, rally, dock diving and lure coursing (chasing a lure around a track).\n\nDespite their high exercise needs, once you wear out your Barbet, they're happy to hang out with you. That's the essential thing with a Barbet—they really just want to be wherever you are and do whatever it is that you're doing.",
  "care_description": "Barbet dogs have moderate care needs. They hardly shed at all, but their coat requires daily brushing and regular trimmings. These are high-energy pups, which means you'll be spending a lot of time exercising this working dog. However, they're not too difficult to train, so you'll be able to spend a lot of time teaching your pup that new trick you saw on Tiktok.",
  "grooming_description": "Barbets require more grooming and maintenance than most other breeds when it comes to their coat care.\n\n \t• Brushing: Their adult coat comes in around 2–3 years of age, when you'll see an uptick in mats and tangles. To avoid these from forming, check your dog's coat daily and brush approximately once a week using a slicker brush.\nBathing: Give your Barbet a bath about once every four to six weeks. If you plan to groom your Barbet yourself, blow dry them after the bath to straighten their hair, give them an all over trim, and then re-wet your Barbet, and let them air dry—their signature curls will come back in full force. (Show tip: If you plan to participate in dog shows, you'll cut your dog's fur to three to five inches in length and the curls on the head must touch their muzzle.)\nNail trimming: Their nails grow quickly, so you'll likely need to give them a nail trim every two to four weeks or when you hear them tapping on the floor.\nEar cleaning: Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nDental care: Veterinarians recommend brushing your dog's teeth daily to stop plaque and tartar from building up. Periodontal disease can lead to a loss of teeth and even more serious issues like heart disease. In addition to regular brushings at home, be sure to take your dog to the vet for professional dental cleanings annually.",
  "training_description": "Barbets are a sensitive and even-tempered breed and respond best to positive reinforcement training (aka using treats and praise to reward your dog's good efforts). They are smart and eager to please, which makes training your Barbet both fun and—dare we say it—easy.\n\nObedience training should include the basic commands, like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. But Barbets love a good challenge, so after they get the basics down, teach your puppy fun tricks like shake, roll over and play dead.\n\nIt's important to get your Barbet puppy used to meeting new people, other dogs and situations while they're young (aka socialization); it's helps to bring out their naturally friendly nature. Take them on walks and let them meet and sniff the people and pups they meet. Enroll in puppy preschool, and they'll learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet other pup parents all in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Barbets typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you use a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet and nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nBecause Barbets are so active and always on the go, they may benefit from a high-protein dog food, but again, consult with your veterinarian for more expert information, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your Barbet based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Barbets are high-energy pups who need a lot of exercise, so plan on about one to two hours spread throughout the day. While walks and long hikes are good, these dogs have webbed paws designed for swimming. Barbets are happiest when paddling around in the water; you'll make their day if adventures include romps in lakes or rivers (or even your own backyard pool).\n\nIf you've got a bit of a competitive streak, you and your Barbet might enjoy dog sports as a fun way to bond. Consider sports like agility, rally, dock diving (playing to their water-loving nature) or lure coursing, where they speed around a track chasing a mechanical lure.\n\nWhen the weather isn't so great out, bring the fun indoors with games like hide-n-seek or fetch (if your home has enough room or a long hallway). Puzzle toys are great to keep around the house and gives them the mental stimulation they need. A bored Barbet will come up with not-so-fun ways to entertain themselves, like chewing your shoes.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Barbet is a medium-sized breed, so they'll do well in an apartment or a large house as long as they're able to get the ample amounts of daily exercise they need. And since they're an active breed, they'll enjoy participating in all your fun adventures; it's time to bring out that backpack! Barbets were bred to be strong swimmers, so they're in sheer heaven if you live near a pond, lake or other body of water.\r\n\r\nBarbets adore their family and are likely to be glued to your side 24/7. If you'll be gone for long during the day, check them into a doggy daycare or arrange for a pet sitter to come by for some playtime.\r\n\r\nThese pups are happy to make friends with everyone—kids, new friends at the front door (what's a stranger, Mom?) and that Yorkie across the street. If you're the party planner of your circle of friends, your Barbet will be more than happy to play hostess and greet everyone who's coming to dinner.\r\n\r\nThey'll be happy with other dogs in the home, and when properly introduced, they should get along with cats just fine. However, these dogs were born to hunt birds, so if you have a pet parakeet, you may want to think twice about bringing a Barbet into the home.",
  "health_description": "The Barbet breed has a life expectancy of 12-14 years and is relatively healthy with few medical issues. But knowing what health conditions they can suffer from may help you give your furry friend the best care possible. \r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Hip and elbow dysplasia are conditions that occur when the affected joint doesn’t develop properly. This may lead to the bones rubbing, grinding or popping out of place, causing discomfort and pain for your dog. These genetic disorders can be confirmed with an X-ray. Symptoms for hip dysplasia include “bunny hopping,” difficulty getting up or reduced activity. Symptoms for elbow dysplasia include limping, puffy elbows or front paws pointing outwards. Treatments for hip and elbow dysplasia may include weight reduction, exercise restriction, physical therapy, supplements, anti-inflammatory medications or surgery. \r\n \t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This degenerative disease affects a dog’s photoreceptor cells in the retina, eventually causing blindness. PRA usually starts with night blindness. There is no effective treatment for PRA, but it’s usually not painful, and most dogs can adjust to vision loss. \r\n \t• Seizure Disorders: While there are many causes for seizures, the most common cause of seizures in dogs is idiopathic epilepsy, an inherited disorder without a known cause. Once a dog has been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, a vet may recommend that they go on anticonvulsant medication to help manage the disorder. \r\n \t• Allergies: If your dog licks incessantly, is constantly rubbing their face or getting ear infections, it could be a sign they have allergies. The good news is that allergies are usually manageable. Your vet can help you discover what your pup is allergic to and, depending on the type and severity, may recommend medications or changing their diet.",
  "history_description": "The Barbet gets their name from their distinctive beard, or barbe in French. These water-loving pups were first mentioned in 16th century France as a dog who was bred for hunting water game and were used to locate, flush and retrieve birds.\r\n\r\nThe Barbet is often thought to be one of the breeds that make up popular dogs like the Poodle, Bichon Frise, Briard and the Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe Barbet is a rare breed. After almost completely disappearing after both World Wars, this French water dog is making a slow comeback thanks to the efforts of dedicated breeders around the world. They first came to the United States in the fall of 2000, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in January 2020 as their 194th breed.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in raising a Barbet? Be prepared to be patient; these pups are rare, so you may have to wait up to a year to find your BFF. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Barbet puppy price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend $2,500–$4,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a Barbet puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. Because this pup's so rare, it's uncommon to find this breed in a rescue or shelter.",
