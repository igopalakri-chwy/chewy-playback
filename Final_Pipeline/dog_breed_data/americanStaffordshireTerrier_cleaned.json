  "breed_intro": "Think of the American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff) as a weightlifter. They're muscular, strong and a bit of a show-off. (They enjoy flexing for everyone.) But you don't mind—it gives you a sense of security no matter where you go. It's kind of nice to have your very own bodyguard. But you know something no one else does: Your AmStaff's a big ol' softie whose favorite wubby is a stuffed moose. (You even caught them napping with it once.) Smart and playful with a no-nonsense side, you can't imagine a better pup to call your own—or keep an eye on your front door.",
  "appearance_description": "One look at the American Staffordshire Terrier, and you'll know this dog is fearless. The AmStaff's intelligent, dark eyes reveal they're always aware of their surroundings. Their high-set ears come to alert when you're near, as they're instantly ready to play. Their medium-sized, stocky bodies come in a variety of colors and patterns. These muscular dogs may look imposing, but they're loveable and loyal.",
  "temperament_description": "American Staffordshire Terriers are not lazy dogs, but they're not super energetic dogs, like Border Collies, either. At the end of the day, they're content to curl up next to you. These super-smart dogs love to play with their families and let their goofy side really show. Some have even earned the nickname \"gentle giants\" because they're so good with older children and tend not to be bothered by the hustle and bustle of a busy household.",
  "care_description": "The American Staffordshire Terrier puppy is a loving, loyal family pet. But they need a lot of socialization with other pets and animals from a young age, so they don't become too wary of strangers. They're very smart and take well to training and just need short walks every day to stay happy. These dogs may be medium-sized in height and weight, but they're big on personality and will quickly become your best friend.",
  "grooming_description": "American Staffordshire Terriers have short, slick coats, so they're easy to groom—even though their \"pokey\" hairs can sometimes be difficult to get out of your clothes. The KONG ZoomGroom is ideal for brushing your American Staffy because the rubber-based brush removes dead hair and leaves the rest behind. They don't need to be brushed very often, however. A light brushing once a week is typically enough.\n\nTheir short coat means shedding is less of a problem than you'd find with longer-haired breeds. However, they still shed those short hairs a lot, so be prepared to vacuum your floors frequently.\n\nHere are some more grooming tips for your AmStaff:\n\n \t• Baths: The AmStaff needs a bath about once every two to four weeks. Of course, if they go outside and get dirty, you might need to bathe them more frequently.\nNail trims: Most dogs the size of American Staffies only need a nail trim every four to six weeks at the most. If they're outside a lot, they may wear their nails down naturally. If you can hear their nails clicking on the floor when they walk, this means it's time to trim them.\nBrushing teeth: It's ideal to brush your dog's teeth daily. Start brushing their teeth when they're young, to get them used to the process. Your veterinarian can help teach you the best technique. Don't forget to take your dog in for professional teeth cleaning at the veterinarian's office once a year.",
  "training_description": "Training an American Staffordshire Terrier breed needs to be consistent, and using positive reinforcement methods will help you attain the best results. Positive reinforcement training uses treats, toys and lots of praise to reward your pup for a job well done. You'll want to start training early while your AmStaff's a puppy, even as young as 8 weeks of age. American Staffies  may try to push your boundaries, so be firm in your training—but stay positive. AmStaffs are very smart, and when they take to training, they can learn new tricks every day.\n\nEarly training should include socialization with other animals and people. Getting them familiar with guests while they're young will help them be used to company when they're older. Remember to keep everyone safe while socializing your dog, so you can develop a lot of positive associations early on. You might even want to work with a professional dog trainer to help you discover the best socialization techniques for your pup.\n\nAmerican Staffordshire Terriers are loving dogs, so they respond well to lots of positive, verbal praise. But keep in mind that each dog is an individual, and sometimes it can be tough to figure out exactly what motives your strong-willed dog. Don't rule out toys as a possible motivator. Sometimes they'll respond more to a fun game with their pet parent (like a game of tug-of-war) than they will to a treat. If you engage their natural desires during training, such as utilizing games of tug-of-war, they might be extra enthusiastic about learning.",
  "diet_nutrition": "American Staffordshire Terriers thrive with a complete, balanced diet. They'll typically do well with a high-quality, commercial dog food. Make sure you factor in your AmStaff's age when choosing their food and diet. Look for food designed for their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult dog or senior. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific nutrition needs.\n\nWhen choosing their feeding schedule, don't forget to calculate the calories from treats. You might also distribute some of their meals through interactive feeding toys to help give them some mental exercise while eating. Try a slow feeder and see which your dog likes best. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the ideal food and treats for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "American Staffordshire Terriers are high-energy dogs, so a calm walk around the park won't be your pup's only form of exercise. If you're looking for a jogging buddy, look no farther than your AmStaff. Your pup needs at least an hour of exercise every day, so mix it up with jogs, walks and games. (They love to catch Frisbees!)\r\n\r\nLooking for ways to shake up your routine? Play to your pup's strengths! American Staffies are strong dogs, so they often enjoy games that focuses on pulling. A game of tug-of-war using a rope toy is a simple way to get in some good exercise. This breed might also enjoy interactive feeding for some mental stimulation and a dig pit (like a sandbox just for them) in the backyard to play in.\r\n\r\nSome AmStaffs love bikejoring because it gives them a chance to use their natural power. Bikejoring is dog-powered mountain biking, where one or two dogs pull in front of a bike (like sledding, but without the snow—and with wheels). This can be an individual sport with timed trials or an off-road competition. Your AmStaff will need to get used to a harness designed for the sport, and you'll also need a special attachment for your bike. Talk to your veterinarian to make sure your dog is socialized and healthy enough to enjoy the sport.\r\n\r\nThey may also enjoy many other sports as forms of daily exercise, including agility sports.",
  "ideal_environment": "American Staffordshire Terriers are loving dogs who thrive on family time. They're happiest when they can just spend time with their immediate family, whether at home or outside. AmStaffs do well in families with older children but without other pets. (They get all your attention that way!) And they are happiest in homes with lots of land to run and play in. They may do OK in apartments as long as they're able to get in plenty of exercise every day.\r\n\r\nRemember, these are strong and smart dogs, so they may not be ideal for first-time pup parents. They need someone who understands the unique qualities of this breed and is confident they can bring out the best in this pup.\r\n\r\nAmStaffs are often affected by breed-specific legislation that is designed to reduce the number of dog attacks in communities by certain dog breeds, so check with your city ordinances or home owner's association regulations to make sure you're following the set guidelines before bringing your pup home.",
  "health_description": "American Staffordshire Terriers have a lifespan of 12-16 years, but the breed can have a few health issues. To help them have the longest life expectancy possible, work with an AmStaff breeder who screens for these issues. Also, visit your veterinarian regularly. And if you’re adopting your pup, be sure to get a copy of the vet wellness exam. \n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia can be a common problem with AmStaffs. This occurs when the hip joint doesn’t fit properly. Look for a breeder who tests for this issue. Dysplasia typically isn’t preventable, but your veterinarian can recommend treatments to help keep it from affecting your dog’s quality of life. Keeping your pup at a healthy weight can also help. If the condition is severe, surgery may be needed. \n \t• Elbow Dysplasia: Elbow dysplasia is another musculoskeletal problem that can affect American Staffordshire Terriers. This condition can be hereditary and causes degenerative changes of the elbow joint, leading to lameness and arthritis as dogs mature. For dogs with mild symptoms, joint supplements and anti-inflammatory medications may help provide relief, but surgery is an option for dogs who are more severely affected. \n \t• Heart Disease: Heart failure is a leading cause of death in older American Staffies. This is often caused by a weakened valve and can be detected as a heart murmur during a regular vet checkup. If caught early, medications may be prescribed. Regular vet checkups, a healthy diet and plenty of exercise can help protect your pup from heart disease. \n \t• Allergies: White and blue/gray AmStaffs are especially prone to allergies, which can lead to hair loss and reddened skin. Veterinarians can help you keep the allergies under control with either a change in diet or medications. \n \t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA):  American Staffordshire Terriers are predisposed to PRA, a hereditary condition that can cause blindness in affected dogs. The earliest sign of PRA is often a loss of night vision, which can progress to complete blindness. The condition is not painful, but there is no treatment for it. Responsible breeders should have their dogs screened for PRA and not breed dogs who are carriers for the condition.",
  "history_description": "The American Staffordshire Terrier is one of several dog breeds with a darker origin. They were bred as fighting and baiting dogs in the 18th and 19th centuries. The AmStaff's exact genetic lineage is debated, but most agree that the Bulldog from 200 years ago makes up part of their genetic history. Others believe that the extinct White English Terrier and Black and Tan Terrier were also part of the AmStaff's bloodline. Whichever specific breeds were used, for a time, the dogs were used mostly for dogfighting in the UK, even after the blood sport was outlawed.\r\n\r\nThe breed arrived in the United States in the mid-1800s. Some say that once in the US, they were used mostly for farming and hunting rather than fighting. Over time, they were bred to be taller, larger dogs and were first registered with the American Kennel Club in 1936 as the Staffordshire Terrier. In 1972, the AKC recognized two distinct breeds: the American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Today's AmStaff is much friendlier and calmer than their 18th-century fighting ancestor.\r\n\r\nFun fact: Some people mistake American Staffies for American Pit Bull Terriers, but they're not the same dog. The AKC recognizes the American Staffordshire Terrier, but not the American Pit Bull Terrier (but the breed is recognized by the United Kennel Club). Generally, AmStaffs are less bulky, although similar in strength. Now, this is where it may get confusing: The term \"pitbull\" is also a generic term for all bully breeds, including the AmStaff. (Bully breeds are all the dogs who share a common, extinct ancestor called the Molossus.)\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find an American Staffordshire Terrier puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The average American Staffy price can be anywhere from $250-$2,000 for a puppy, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. Puppies with the most impressive pedigrees might even cost $10,000 or more. You can also find a purebred to adopt with the help of American Staffordshire Terrier rescue organizations and local shelters. Or, search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are American Staffordshire Terriers Pit Bulls?",
      "answer": "American Staffordshire Terriers are pitbulls, but they're not Pit Bulls. Confusing? The American Pit Bull Terrier is a separate breed from the Amstaff. (APBTs are not recognized by the AKC, but they are recognized by the United Kennel Club.) The breeds do look similar; some people try to use the red nose as a distinguishing mark of the APBT, but this isn't reliable. The red nose was mostly bred out of the AmStaff, but that doesn't mean you can't find a American Staffy with a red nose. \"Pitbull\"—one word—is a generic term used to describe a group of dogs known as the \"bully breeds.\" Because AmStaffs are a bully breed, they can also be described as a pitbull."

      "question": "Do American Staffordshire Terriers shed?",
      "answer": "Yes, American Staffordshire Terriers shed. Although they have short coats, they can still shed more than you'd think. Granted, shedding isn't as much of a problem as it can be for long-haired breeds, especially those who have seasonal shedding (spring and fall). But you can still find a lot of fur on the floor and might find yourself vacuuming frequently."
