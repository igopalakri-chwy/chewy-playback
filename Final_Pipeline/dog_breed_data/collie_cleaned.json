  "breed_intro": "If Collie dogs were Hollywood stars, they'd be… wait, they are movie stars! Remember Lassie, Timmy's beloved protector and companion in the classic films and TV series? Well, she was a Collie. And when you get to know this breed, you'll quickly understand why. Few dogs better embody the notions of loyalty and friendship. Smart, easy-to-train and affectionate, Collies are among the most popular family dogs, keeping children entertained and busy with their endlessly energetic, live-in play date. Just like children, your Collie will quickly let you know when they're bored. They'll talk, and you'll listen because their bark is no joke. But you'll quickly forgive the chatter once you're out for your long daily walks—these pups do need a lot of exercise—and your celebrity status around the neighborhood starts to rise alongside your elegantly furry friend. Did you know the Collie is one of only four dogs to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame? It's the company you keep, after all.",
  "appearance_description": "The Collie dog breed possesses a natural elegance and spirit that gives them a proud, graceful appearance. Whether it's the longer-coated Rough Collie or the shorter-coated Smooth, Collies are delightful medium-sized dogs with a distinctive mixed color coat and that unmistakably pointed and friendly “Collie\" face.",
  "temperament_description": "Collies are the quintessential extroverts. They are gregarious animals who seek companionship, love their families and are great with kids and babies. But jealous types, beware. While their love for you will be unwavering, they'll happily spread that love to just about anyone they meet, be that strangers or other pets. Naturally, they don't have high biting tendencies and aren't known to be a particularly aggressive breed. Collies are also big fans of play, and many love nothing better than to speed around the yard chasing a ball or Frisbee. Yes, they are the ultimate teammate you've always dreamed about.\n\nFans of fun though they may be, Collies are not classified in the American Kennel Club's Sporting Group but are instead members of the Herding Group (they were used for centuries to herd sheep on working farms). So, if you own livestock, or simply want to channel your inner sheep farmer, then a Collie might be just the dog breed for you. You might even find yourself competing in a herding event or two.\n\nBecause these dogs were born to have a job to do, they'll get noisy when they're lonely or bored. A tired Collie is a quiet Collie. If your pup is barking a lot (and there are no strangers lurking), it's a sign your Collie may need more exercise and time with you. Take them on extra walks and play games with them to help release that extra energy.\n\nHerding behaviors like heel nipping or bossiness can also be intimidating to children. Of course, every dog is an individual and not all Collies display these traits. But for many parents, these concerns are outweighed by the breed's other kid-friendly traits. After all, Collies are great family dogs. It's literally how they became so famous. Of course, it's not only important to socialize and train all dogs, but pet parents should also teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\n\nCollies have a low prey drive and are not typically used as hunting dogs, but they do perform a variety of other jobs. They're popular as service dogs, partly because of their versatility, partly because they retain training so well and also because of their ability to adapt to a variety of living situations and the energy levels of their families. Collies are also used as therapy dogs. They really are a well-rounded dog.",
  "care_description": "While it's true that Collies are high-energy dogs who shed a lot and like (read: love) to bark, they can be a surprisingly good choice for first-time pet parents. Collies usually get along well with other pets and children, are easy to train and are adaptable to many different lifestyles. Plus, they want to take care of you as much as you care for them.",
  "grooming_description": "When it comes to their coats, the Smooth Collie and the Rough Collie have different brushing needs because of their uniquely characteristic coats, but their overall routine is basically the same.\n\n\t• Rough Collies—especially adult males—have long hair and coat. While beautiful to behold, it does come with a lot of extra grooming work. Using a slicker brush, pin brush and comb, you should brush your Collie a few times a week to make sure the occasional tangle doesn't turn into a matted mess. First, brush against the fur growth with the slicker brush to remove the dead hair, then brush in the direction of hair growth with the pin brush to smooth it out. Follow up with a comb to ensure you've removed all the tangles. Pay particular attention to problem areas: behind the ears and the front legs, under the belly, and the back of the rear legs. Rough Collies will blow their coat in the spring and fall as the seasons change. (A dog who blows their coat will shed their coat in chunks instead of a lot of hairs at once.)\nSmooth Collies, on the other hand, have a coat that's low-maintenance and elegant. If you're looking for an easy-to-groom dog who won't require a lot of work, then you'd probably be happiest with the smooth-coated Collie. Brush a Smooth Collie with a rubber curry brush or a slicker brush about once a week.\n\nHere are more grooming tips, for either type of Collie:\n\n\t• Shaving: Buzz cuts are out of the question. Never, ever shave your Collie. If you do, you could irreparably change the way the hairs grow back and damage the way the inner coat insulates and protects your furry friend from the sun. And that would make your best buddy so sad.\nBathing: You should, however, bathe your pup approximately every three months, but not more. Overdoing it can damage the natural oils in their coats.\nNail trimming: Other important parts of grooming include giving your Collie a good nail trimming about once a month or whenever necessary to avoid the “clickety-clack\" noises on the kitchen tile\nDental care: Brush your Collie's teeth daily, and schedule yearly professional dental cleanings.\nEar cleaning: To help prevent ear infections, check your Collie's ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.",
  "training_description": "Collies are herding dogs, and while their herding instincts are perhaps not as strong as those found in Border Collies, Australian Shepherds and Australian Cattle Dogs, it's something to keep in mind while you go about basic obedience training. Why? Because those instincts have made Collies fast learners who need training that will challenge their impressive brains.\n\nAnother factor to remember is that Collies tend to be fairly sensitive dogs. So, while they are famously easy to train and love to learn, it's essential to introduce new training concepts and experiences in an upbeat, encouraging way and to reward calm, relaxed interactions. Your Collie puppy will respond well to toys, treats and praise for a job well done. Positive reinforcement (aka rewarding their good behaviors) is also a great way to bond with your pup, help build your Collie's new skills and keep them comfortable in a variety of situations.\n\nIf the Collie has any behavior problems at all (other than barking), it's timidity. Hard to believe, but hey, lots of celebs are actually pretty shy in real life. That just makes socialization extra important with Collie puppies. Aim to introduce them to experiences in a positive way and to environments they will encounter on a regular basis throughout life, like pet supply stores, the vet's office and the park. Early encounters like these are critical to helping puppies become successful and versatile pets later in life.\n\nEven so, barking can always be an issue with the Collie dog breed. If that's a deal-breaker for you, you could choose a different breed (boo!) or adopt an adult rescue Collie who's been fostered and you know is quiet (yeah!).\n\nOne more pro-tip: When you're getting together all the gear you need for training, you may want to opt for a martingale collar rather than a standard buckle collar. Due to the shape of their head and neck, Collies are at risk of accidentally slipping out of standard collars. Martingale collars, on the other hand, have a two-loop design that adjusts to the size of the dog's neck wherever it sits, making it more difficult for your pup to pull a Houdini and escape when they're on-leash.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Collies typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to look for a statement on the food's packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and that you choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). You can ask your veterinarian for advice on choosing the appropriate formula for your Collie.\n\nCollies are susceptible to a condition called bloat, which can be life-threatening. To help reduce the risk for bloat, feed your pup smaller meals more frequently during the day and use a slow feeder.\n\nIt's important to keep your dog at a healthy weight; even an extra pound or two can make a big impact on their overall health. So, be sure to include the treats you give (for training or just because) in their daily caloric count. Opt for a lower-calorie treat or mix up rewards with extra playtime or a massage. If you notice your pup is gaining a little chub, contact your vet. They're in the best position to help you set a meal and exercise plan to help your pup shed the extra weight.",
  "exercise_description": "Collies have high energy levels and exercise needs—but you don't need to be a marathon runner to keep up with them. Their needs are generally manageable for most families. While many Collies are athletic enough to keep up with a jogger, most are content with daily walks, playing ball in the backyard and mental activities such as training, sports or jobs around the house. (Collies are great at putting away their toys and \"go get\" or \"find\" things to bring to you, like a purse or pair of shoes.) Collies party hard, but they'll also happily snuggle in for a Netflix binge with you when playtime is over. Ever attuned to their humans, they know you need to recharge before the next adventure!\n\nCollies need at least an hour of exercise per day, and, ideally, it is active exercise that you participate in, rather than just turning them loose and alone in a fenced-in yard. Some Collies enjoy dog sports, like agility and lure coursing (where dogs chase a mechanical lure around a track), and some ambitious pet parents may even try taking their Collie to a dog show or herding events.",
  "ideal_environment": "Collies typically adore children, and they're also a super companion breed to all family members. They're even good with cats and other pets in the household. They're also well-mannered around guests and are open to meeting new people. Essentially, Collies are just friendly dogs.\n\nHowever, because Collies tend to bark, they may not be the best option for apartment/condo life or for dense neighborhoods. In those scenarios, even Mr. Rogers might not want to be their neighbor.\n\nHowever, Collies make excellent farm dogs, as they typically exhibit a low prey drive and can generally live safely with livestock or poultry. The Collie's herding instincts are lower than some other herding dogs, so if you're hoping to have your Collie help you herd livestock on the farm, be sure to choose individual breeding lines that are known for having intense working drives.\n\nWhether on the farm or in your home, one thing is certain: Collies are indoor pets. While they may enjoy cold weather, they cannot live outside in it, and they don't love especially hot weather, either. Besides, this breed wants to be where you are, and for most people, most of the time, that's inside.",
  "health_description": "Collies have a life expectancy of 12-14 years, which is a fairly typical lifespan of medium-sized dogs, but Collies do have a few health problems to look out for. Be sure to purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder; they screen their dogs for health and temperament issues. Knowing the health problems associated with your breed can help you ensure your pet lives their happiest, longest life. \r\n\n\t• Collie Eye Anomaly: Collie eye anomaly is an inherited ocular disease in Collies and similar breeds that can result in blindness. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that creates a deformity in the eye’s blood vessels during development. A board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist may be able to diagnose this condition when a Collie puppy is as young as 6-8 weeks old. There is also a genetic test for the disease. There is no cure for Collie eye anomaly, but some treatments can help reduce the symptoms.  \r\n\t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA affects the photoreceptors of the retina, causing them to lose their function. This condition has both early-onset and late-onset forms. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for this disease. Because it is caused by a genetic mutation, testing is available to screen for the condition. \r\n\t• Skin Problems: Collies also have the potential to develop several severe immune-mediated skin diseases, including dermatomyositis and pemphigus foliaceus. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition that is inherited. Medication can be used to treat the symptoms, but there is no cure. Pemphigus foliaceus typically occurs in middle-age and causes hair loss and crusty skin, most often on the top of the nose or inside the ear flaps. There is no cure, but it can be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants.  \r\n\t• Hip Dysplasia: Some Collies may be at risk for developing hip dysplasia, a condition in which the hip joint isn’t formed properly. The condition results in looseness of the joint, leading to pain (sometimes severe) and lameness. Fortunately, hip dysplasia occurs in less than 3 percent of the Collie population, and treatments are available to those dogs who do experience it. Although the severity can vary, treatments such as pain relievers, physical therapy or surgery are often prescribed. \r\n\t• MDR1: Some Collies have a sensitivity to certain drugs, so be sure your pup has been tested for “multidrug sensitivity” (MDR1). This genetic mutation can cause Collies to have problems processing certain medications, making them more sensitive to the drugs and more likely to experience toxic side effects. This mutation is inherited, and testing is readily available to identify if your dog is affected.",
  "history_description": "Collies originally came from Scotland, where they were used for centuries to herd sheep on working farms. Their kind personalities, herding skills and devotion to family were highly valued. But after Queen Victoria took notice of the breed in the 1860s, it achieved more widespread recognition, and the dogs quickly went from working stiffs to highly prized escorts of the rich and famous.\n\nNot long after that, in the 1870s, the first Collies came to the United States, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The Collie Club of America was then established in 1886 to help protect and promote the Collie dog breed.\n\nWhile the Collie breed's initial burst of popularity had royal roots, it was the 20th-century writings of Albert Payson Terhune (author of \"Lad, a Dog,\" and other books about Collies) and Eric Knight (author of \"Lassie Come Home\") that gave the breed broader recognition as a beloved family companion. The \"Lassie\" movies and television series that followed between the 1940s and 1970s introduced the Collie to an even wider audience. Today, the Collie ranks No. 38 out of 197 on the AKC's list of most popular dog breeds.\n\nCollies are often confused with the Border Collie, another herding breed, but the two dogs are distinct. Each originated in a different region of the United Kingdom and was bred with an emphasis on working ability. Today's Border Collies are extremely intelligent and intense; modern Collies are more laid-back and easy-going.\n\nSo, where is the best place to find Collie puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The average Collie price will depend on the breeder, but you can expect to spend $1,000-$3,000 for a pup. But for that cost, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues. They might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Collie rescue organizations to adopt a Collie or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
