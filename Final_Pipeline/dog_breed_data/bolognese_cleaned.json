  "breed_intro": "Yes, Bolognese is the name of a pasta sauce, but it also belongs to another, equally wonderful Italian export: a sweet-tempered toy dog breed who was once a favorite of Roman nobility. You'll be instantly smitten with the beauty, playfulness and charm of this silky white ball of fur, as will everyone you pass on your daily walks together. (Be sure to budget extra time to get home!) Despite their royal pedigree, you won't need to pamper your Bolognese too much, aside from daily brushing—they have an unusually laid-back attitude. These dogs are smart, too, but it's their sense of humor that really shines. They never take themselves too seriously, and they love nothing more than to make you laugh. Well, that and a good riposo (that's Italian for \"rest\") curled up in your lap.",
  "appearance_description": "A Bolognese looks like a cloud that's come to life. These soft, fluffy fur balls have a pristine snow-white coat that's eye-catching, especially when well-groomed. Their small stature and stocky build makes them extremely portable and just the right size for burrowing into your lap for hours. With sweet, calm faces and inquisitive brown eyes, your Bolo could easily become the center of your world.",
  "temperament_description": "Caring, loving and young at heart, the Bolognese is known for acting as playful as a puppy well into their senior years. They might be pint-sized, but make no mistake, there's a lot of personality packed into their tiny bodies. This cuddly toy dog breed loves being around people, even strangers—although, true to their royal roots, they may first need proper introductions to feel comfortable.\n\nWith a Bolognese puppy, you're guaranteed a companion dog and cuddle buddy for life—one who will follow you everywhere. Bolos thrive on attention and emotional connection and are happiest when their parent is at home. While these sociable types will get along well with other four-legged pets, they are perfectly happy being the stars of their own one-pup act. Leaving them alone for long periods is a no-no, as this can lead to some less desirable behaviors, like separation anxiety, chewing and barking.\n\nDespite their small size, Bolos can make great watchdogs as they will quickly notice and alert you of anything unusual. But don't count on them to be your bodyguard. Apart from letting you know when there's someone at the door, they're not big barkers and are not prone to biting. They can, however, make great therapy dogs and are perfectly content to match your activity level, keep your lap warm and do pretty much whatever else makes you happy.\n\nThese affectionate, intelligent pups do well with city and apartment dwellers, retirees and families with children who have been taught how to handle them gently and safely. Younger children should be supervised around a Bolognese to avoid accidentally injuring your pup with overly rough play.",
  "care_description": "The Bolognese breed is about as laid-back as dogs come, but when it comes to keeping that gorgeous white coat at its best, they definitely need an extra dose of TLC. This playful breed can be easily distracted and exhibit a stubborn steak, so consistency and patience is a must when training them, especially when they're puppies. The good news? Because they're so chill, they don't need a lot of exercise. They do want all your love and attention, though, which is probably the easiest thing you could ever give to these adorable companions.",
  "grooming_description": "Want to keep your Bolo's coat pristine and snow-white? You'll need to set aside extra time for grooming and bathing this elegant pup. Compared to other breeds, the Bolognese's fur does need an extra dose of self-care, but here's the good news: Shedding is not much of a problem. (Allergy sufferers rejoice!) Even if you keep your dog's coat short—and some pet parents may choose to trim it shorter to make grooming more manageable—you should still brush them every day. Use a pin brush first to prevent mats, followed by a comb to ensure you get all the tangles out.\n\nKeep them looking their best with a whitening dog shampoo at bath time, which should be twice a month or ideally whenever you notice their coat getting dirty. Don't forget to wipe their eyes with a damp cloth every day, as they sometimes have tears in a rusty or brown color that can stain their fur. Find out how to get rid of tear stains here.\n\nKeep their nails trimmed short to avoid splitting or cracking. But no need for a daily pedicure or anything of the sort: A bi-monthly visit to your at-home spa should suffice to prevent any overgrowth. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear them tapping on hard surfaces.\n\nHere's another thing to watch out for: hair that can often overgrow in the Bolo's ears. This can cause buildup in the ears that may lead to infection. To manage, check their ears weekly to ensure they're free of wax, debris or funky odors and alert your veterinarian if you notice anything unusual. Your vet may recommend cleaning their ears.\n\nBecause of their small mouths and tendency toward overcrowded teeth, Bolos can be prone to dental health issues. They should have their teeth brushed daily. The key is to introduce your Bolognese puppy to dental care early in life to prevent tooth decay or disease later on. You should also bring your dog to the vet for a professional tooth cleaning at least once a year.",
  "training_description": "Bolognese dog intelligence is in hefty supply, as is their eagerness to please, which makes them pretty easy to train. Yes, even beginners can do it. The key is to start early. You can begin training when they are as young as 8 weeks old. Keep in mind these pups can be strong-willed (#PamperedRoyals) and are easily bored by repetitive tasks, so don't be afraid to keep them on their toes by mixing it up.\n\nMake sure you don't have any distracting toys or objects lying around and keep your sessions to 30 minutes or less. This will keep your inquisitive canine cutie focused. A range of activities, positive reinforcement (aka rewarding their good behavior with treats, toys and praise) and consistency will keep your Bolognese happily engaged and responsive. Let them know they've done a good job every time by doling out healthy treats, fun toys and lots of hugs. They will, quite literally, eat it up.\n\nLet's talk potty training. A Bolognese puppy can be slow to housebreak, so consistent crate training is key. Because these dogs tend to stay quiet, you may want to teach your Bolo how to ring a bell when they need to potty. Learn more about potty training a dog.\n\nEarly socialization is important, even for this social pup. Getting your puppy used to new dogs, people and situations will help bring out their naturally friendly traits as they grow up. Puppy preschool is a great way to start this. Puppies learn to play nicely with each other, and they get to mingle with other pet parents.\n\nBolos tend to experience separation anxiety when you're gone for long stretches. If you do have to be away for hours at a time, you can check them into doggy daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or neighbor to stop by for a play date while you're gone.\n\nIf neither of those are possible, you can help your pup learn to be OK with the alone time. Just like with every other types of training, start small (i.e., leaving the room) before you're gone for hours at a time. You can use the crate to help teach this. First, leave the room for just a few seconds while your pup's in the crate. Don't make a big deal about it; quietly leave, then come back. Reward your pup when you come back. Over several sessions, build up to leaving the room for a few minutes at a time. Then, progress to out of the house, then driving around the block, and so on. Remember not to make a big deal about you leaving and reward your pup every time you come back. If at any time your pup shows anxiety (cries), take a break and go back to the last step they were comfortable with. Be patient; your pup will pick it up. Just remember, their preference is to always be with you because they love you just that much.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Bolognese dog typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Check the label for a statement that says the food meets nutritional standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and don't forget to choose the right formula for their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can advise you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\r\n\r\nWhile the Bolognese dog breed's diet doesn't specify any particular requirements, it's important you keep an eye on their weight to prevent obesity. Even one extra pound will make a difference in this small dog's overall health. It can be hard to resist giving too many treats to your cuddly pooch, but if they gain excessive weight you may need to either dial it back a notch or take them out on more walks. Conversely, if they start losing too much weight, you may have to adjust their exercise and diet regimen accordingly and take them to the vet for a checkup to ensure there are no underlying health conditions. Again, you should always consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food and treats for your Bolo's diet, based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Since Bolognese were not bred for speed, they are as chilled-out as they come—and conveniently, so is their exercise regimen. A couple of 20-minute walks each day and some playtime (either indoors or outside) should be enough to meet their energy level and exercise needs. Bolos love indoor games like hide-and-seek, chasing balls you roll across the floor or learning new tricks, and these are great activities to include as forms of exercise.\r\n\r\nCompared to other breeds, the Bolognese is relatively low-energy, relaxed, calm and easy-going. Their main goal in life is to make you happy, so they will adjust to your activity levels—within reason, of course. Don't expect them to get into the canine version of CrossFit with you or anything.\r\n\r\nTo keep them healthy, you should ensure they stay both mentally and physically active. Give your pup opportunities to run around and play with puzzles and toys that stimulate them. Whether that takes place in a fenced yard or across your living room floor, the Bolo is perfectly happy—as long as they can be by your side.",
  "ideal_environment": "The sensitive and loving Bolognese is a highly adaptable breed, a great family dog and one who can fit well into almost any type of home. All they ask for in return is the attention they thrive on and not to be left alone too long. Yes, their coats may be high maintenance, but not their hearts. Everything else about them is easy to manage, including their relatively low exercise requirements. For these reasons, Bolos make great pets for first-time pet parents.\r\n\r\nThese charming lapdogs get along well with other four-legged critters, too. If socialized well, they are friendly to all, including strangers, especially if they're good friends of yours. Bolos are known for being almost telepathic and can pick up on their pet parent's vibes.\r\n\r\nIf your family has small children, it's best you supervise them around your Bolognese dogs. While mistaking them for a favorite stuffed animal would be easy for your kiddos to do, rough and tumble play could lead to accidental injuries for your furry friend. Try as they might, Bolos just don't bounce back like the loveys filled with cotton do.",
  "health_description": "The Bolognese breed has a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years and is generally healthy, but can be susceptible to a few medical issues. It’s important to be aware of them so you can help your pup live their healthiest life possible and reduce their risk of developing these conditions.\r\n\n \t• Patellar Luxation: This inherited condition can cause the kneecap to dislocate and repeatedly pop out of place. It can be treated with physical therapy, weight management, joint supplements, anti-inflammatory medication and, in severe cases, surgery.\nHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a genetic hip deformity that can cause lameness and pain. Treatments include weight management, joint supplements, physical therapy and surgery.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a genetic eye problem in which the photoreceptor cells in the eye deteriorate, leading to blindness. There is a genetic screening test for the condition, so be sure to ask your breeder, but unfortunately there is no treatment. However, blind dogs can do great if pet parents take steps to monitor and control the condition through lifestyle changes, like not rearranging furniture, so they don’t bump into things.",
  "history_description": "The Bolognese dog originated hundreds of years ago in Italy, where their name comes from the city of Bologna. (That is the only connection they have to the famed Italian pasta sauce that hails from the same place. Yes, great things come from Bologna.) Historically, these amiable lapdogs were often given as gifts to kings and queens as far back as the 11th and 12th centuries. They were so loved, in fact, that Roman nobility, as well as some of the most powerful and wealthy families throughout Italy, commissioned portraits featuring these pups. However, as the aristocracy diminished in power and influence, the breed almost went extinct. A few enthusiastic modern-day breeders saved them from obsolescence in the 1980s, restoring not only the breed as a whole, but their popularity, too.\r\n\r\nBolos came to England in 1990 and were recognized by the United Kennel Club here in the United States in 1995. The Bolos were recorded in the Foundation Stock Service (a breed registry of the American Kennel Club) in 1999. Because the breed is so rare and relatively new to the United States, it is not yet fully recognized by the AKC, but they have been permitted to compete in AKC companion events since 2008. They are also referred to as Bichon Bolognese, since they belong to the Bichon family of dogs.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Bolognese to your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. While the average Bolognese puppy price may vary, you can expect the cost to run anywhere from $1,200 to $2,000 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may even come with pedigree papers. You can also adopt from a local Bolognese rescue organization or check the listings at your local animal shelter. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs for Bolognese in your area.",
