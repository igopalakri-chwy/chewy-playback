  "breed_intro": "The American Foxhound has boundless energy and an up-for-anything attitude, making them the perfect canine companion for active pet parents. An afternoon run through the park? Time to get the leash. Want to participate in scent tracking competitions? See you in the winner's circle. Ready to take an afternoon nap? Who are you kidding? You'll be in the backyard engaging in a lively game of fetch with your perky pooch. Smart and tons of fun, this breed won't stop 'til they're ready to flop.",
  "appearance_description": "It's common for American Foxhounds to keep their noses to the ground in search of exciting activities, but when these floppy-eared hound dogs do look up, their expressive faces seem to say, “Play with me.\" Their tri-color coats are shades of black, white and tan, and each American Foxhound has their own unique markings.",
  "temperament_description": "It's hard not to fall in love with an American Foxhound dog. At the dog park, running errands or waiting on the vet, this outgoing breed knows how to turn strangers into friends. Their personality is best described as easygoing, mild-mannered and up for adventure.\r\n\r\nAmerican Foxhounds are charming and shameless in their quest for attention: Pet them once, and they'll return for affection (and return the affection) over and over. While the breed doesn't quite achieve Velcro-dog status, American Foxhounds love spending time with their people.\r\n\r\nFoxhounds will thrive as members of active families who want a four-legged companion for games of tag, long walks around the neighborhood, trips to the park, swimming and camping. And, after all the outdoor activities, these floppy-eared hounds will happily flop down on the couch for family movie night.\r\n\r\nWhile your four-legged bestie would happily spend all their time enjoying long walks in the park and cuddling on the couch and are great with kids, it can't be all play and no work; raising a Foxhound requires regular and consistent training. These dogs were bred to hunt and need a job to do. Providing physical and mental stimulation—think food puzzles, training games or competitive dog sports—can help promote good behavior.\r\n\r\nLike other scent hounds, Foxhound dogs are pack hounds and tend to enjoy the company of other dogs and appreciate having a four-legged playmate to help burn off some of their excess energy. But be cautious about introducing an American Foxhound to other pets, including cats; the breed is not aggressive and exhibits minimal biting tendencies, but they may chase (and scare) smaller animals.",
  "care_description": "Exercise is the primary love language for American Foxhounds. Be prepared to provide lots of high-octane activities to keep this active breed on their best behavior. While they are known for being easygoing, American Foxhounds can also be strong-willed and require regular training (plus grooming and well-balanced diets) to be happy, healthy members of the family.",
  "grooming_description": "While you could take your American Foxhound to the groomer for a pro bath and blow out, these are low-maintenance dogs, so don't be afraid to DIY.\n\nThanks to their short coats, American Foxhound grooming is simple. These dogs shed less than other breeds and have “wash-and-go\" coats that require minimal care. Brush them once a week with a bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove excess hair and lather them up in the bath a few times a year to remove dirt and oil from their coats (or more often if they spend a lot of time hiking in the woods, swimming or rolling in pungent places). While you're giving your pup the once-over with a brush, be sure to check their ears for signs of infection (redness, swelling) and alert your vet if you notice anything unusual. Your vet my recommend you clean their ears as needed.\n\nTrim their nails about once a month. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear them clacking on hard surfaces.\n\nDental care is also important. American Foxhounds, like all breeds, benefit from an at-home routine that includes dental chews and rinses and brushing their teeth daily. The earlier you start, the easier it'll be to make oral health a habit. And don't forget to schedule an annual professional dental cleaning with your vet.",
  "training_description": "Although American Foxhounds have great qualities, including sweet temperaments, a strong-willed streak is one of their well-known traits. Like other scent hounds, American Foxhounds have high levels of intelligence but like to follow their noses and can be easily distracted by their environment.\n\nTo succeed in training, break down skills into smaller steps and offer rewards like treats, toys or praise for accomplishing each step. American Foxhounds have high energy levels, and keeping training fast-paced can keep them from becoming bored.\n\nSigning up for obedience training and practicing recall (come when called) is also important. Obedience training teaches your American Foxhound puppy important skills like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Keeping them on a leash or in fenced areas prevents them from following a scent and not coming back. It's important to realize that, even if you teach them to come when called, they may not come back if they catch an interesting scent and are off-leash. (These dogs were born to hunt by scent and are known for their speed.)\n\nAnd don't forget socialization! Even though this pup is very friendly, you want to make sure they have lots of positive experiences with people and other dogs while they're puppies. (It'll help bring out the best of their bubbly personalities as they get older.) Enroll them in puppy preschool, where they'll learn to play nicely with other pups and get to meet other pup parents all in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Like all breeds, American Foxhounds benefit from being fed well-balanced commercial dog food designed for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Ask your vet for information about choosing a formula for active breeds to ensure your high-energy dog gets the calories they need for optimal health.\r\n\r\nFoxhounds are enthusiastic eaters and may eat too much (and gain weight) if they are allowed to graze all day; measure out their kibble and feed them one to two meals every day to keep their weight in check. Your veterinarian can create a feeding chart to help you determine how much to feed your American Foxhound.\r\n\r\nEven though these pups are very active, obesity can still be a concern if they eat too much. Remember to limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to prevent weight gain. (Those calories count, too!) If you notice your pup's getting a little portly, chat with your vet. They can help you balance mealtimes, snacks and exercise to help your pup shed the weight and get the nutrition they need.",
  "exercise_description": "If American Foxhounds could write their dating profiles, the first line would read, “No couch potatoes allowed.\"\n\nThese dogs were bred to follow the scent of a fox, traveling across difficult terrain for long distances and, even if there are no foxes to hunt, American Foxhounds are not lapdogs. They're an active breed who requires lots of exercise, like hiking, swimming or competitive dog sports (think: agility, obedience and tracking). Plan on at least an hour (if not more) every day. It's important to keep them on a leash or in fenced areas to prevent these scent hounds from following their nose and running off. And remember, if their exercise needs aren't met, the Foxhound breed can become bored and destructive. Pro tip: A tired Foxhound is a well-behaved Foxhound.\n\nMental stimulation is important, too. Teach them new tricks, provide lots of opportunities to sniff during walks and give them food puzzles to solve when inside to keep them entertained.",
  "ideal_environment": "American Foxhounds need active families. This easygoing, good-natured breed gets along well with children and other dogs and even loves strangers, especially if those interactions involve running, jumping, wrestling, fetch, tug-of-war or other fast-paced activities.\n\nAlthough they are medium-sized dogs, their go-go-go personalities might be too much for families with very small children who could get knocked down by an exuberant American Foxhound.\n\nTheir ideal home has a fenced backyard with neighbors who don't mind being serenaded by bays and howls on a regular basis. They're a vocal breed with a lot to say, so a living situation with shared walls may not be a great fit.\n\nWith outgoing personalities and a desire to be on the go, these social butterflies will make sure you meet all of your neighbors (and the mail carrier, local shopkeepers and other dog parents at the park). The more social interactions and physical activities in their lives, the happier they'll be.\n\nThe Foxhound breed also needs boundaries. The breed has an independent streak and may resist training, so expect to spend time teaching them good manners using positive, rewards-based training.",
  "health_description": "American Foxhounds have a lifespan of 11 to 13 years. Compared with other breeds at high risk for numerous health issues, they’re considered quite healthy—but that doesn’t mean they aren’t affected by common conditions.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: This condition is diagnosed when the ball and socket that make up the hip joints don’t fit together quite right, causing varying degrees of pain, instability of the joints and arthritis as the dog matures. While hip dysplasia is more common in large breeds, it also affects American Foxhounds. The risk factors range from genetics and excessive growth to weight and nutrition. Your veterinarian may recommend joint supplements, anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy or, in severe cases, surgery.\nEar Infections: Like other floppy-eared hounds, American Foxhounds are at higher risk of ear infections. The shape of their ears covers their ear canals, trapping moisture and creating the right environment for bacteria and yeast to thrive. Remember to dry their ears thoroughly after a bath or swim and ask your vet for tips to clean their ears to prevent infections.\nBloat: American Foxhounds have deep chests and thin waists, putting them at increased risk for bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). GDV occurs when gas stretches the stomach and causes it to twist. The condition can be life-threatening, so if you suspect your pup has GDV, go to the vet immediately. You can prevent it by feeding your pup smaller meals more often throughout the day; using a  slow feeder  to prevent them from inhaling their kibble; and avoiding strenuous exercise one hour before and after meals. To prevent it from recurring, your vet may recommend a procedure that stitches the stomach to the side of the body.\nBlood disorders: American Foxhounds are predisposed to develop thrombocytopathy, which is a blood disorder that affects the normal clotting ability of platelets. Affected dogs may bruise more easily than normal, which could be a particular concern for active, working dogs.",
  "history_description": "The American Foxhound is believed to be the oldest—and perhaps the first—dog breed developed in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1650, European settlers landed on American shores with their hound dogs in tow. Cross-breeding various hounds led to taller, lighter and faster dogs who excelled at following scents, chasing foxes and working alongside hunters on horseback.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington played a special role in their history by keeping a pack of American Foxhounds at Mount Vernon. He expanded his breeding program and crossed his hounds with English Foxhounds imported from France as a gift from the Marquis de Layfette to further refine the breed. Over time, the American Foxhound became increasingly distinct from the English Foxhound.\r\n\r\nIt's a little-known fact that Washington hosted annual hunts at Mount Vernon, inviting equestrians and their hounds to race across the grounds in pursuit of foxes. Horses and hounds were a popular combination for well-heeled plantation owners across Virginia, and the American Foxhound was the preferred dog for hunting and companionship. In fact, the pup is the state dog of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1886 and is a lesser-known breed nationwide. If you're looking for a Foxhound puppy, you can find reputable breeders through the American Kennel Club's website. Puppies cost between $400 to $600. But for that price, you're likely getting a puppy who's been screened for temperament and health issues and may include pedigree papers. You might also find an American Foxhound available for adoption through a rescue group specializing in hound breeds. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs for American Foxhounds in your area.",
