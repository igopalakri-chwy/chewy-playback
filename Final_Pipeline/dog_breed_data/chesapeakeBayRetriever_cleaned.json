  "breed_intro": "In a high school comedy with an all-canine cast, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever (aka Chessie) would play the handsome jock with a heart of gold. Smart, athletic and fiercely loyal, this muscular breed would do anything to protect their loved ones. Great companions for pet parents who are always on the go, high-energy Chessies are happiest outside running, playing with toys, or, better still, swimming the day away. Hunting dogs at heart, these sporty pups have the stamina to fetch that ball for hours. The Great Outdoors are calling, so be prepared to answer with your Chessie by your side—this breed just might answer the call for you both.",
  "appearance_description": "Chesapeake Bay Retriever dogs are the poster dogs for the Great Outdoors. Their waterproof, wavy coat comes in light to dark brown shades, deadgrass (a combination of yellow and tan) and sedge (a red-hued coat) and provides natural camouflage when hunting or playing fetch. Large, lean and muscular, Chessies are a sight to behold. Their striking amber eyes reflect their intellect, while their high-octave bark keeps potential intruders at bay.",
  "temperament_description": "Pet parents who think there is just too much life to be lived to stay indoors will find their canine soulmate in the Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog. With energy levels through the roof, these dogs thrive when they can accompany you on outdoor adventures.\r\n\r\nUnlike other retriever breeds who would gladly welcome anyone over and pour them a cup of coffee if they could (we're looking at you, Labs), Chessies can be reserved around strangers. Couple that with their strong bark and powerful physique, and strangers and nosy neighbors might take pause.\r\n\r\nChessies have a high drive to hunt and retrieve, but they can be good with kids as long as everyone respects each other's boundaries. (So teach your kids how to respectfully interact with dogs, and vice versa.) They are also prone to resource guarding, especially with their toys around young children—a behavior you must correct immediately for a harmonious co-existence. Raising a Chesapeake Bay Retriever with kids and other dogs from puppyhood offers everyone the best chance to get along.\r\n\r\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers are affectionate and loyal to their family—and sometimes don't want to share their toys, chews or retrievals. They are considered the most strong-willed of the retriever breeds, and their intelligence and independent streak may test the patience of a new pet parent, though it shouldn't stump those willing to put in the training time. While Chessies love having an active job, they are also content to bond with their pet parents through active play and enrichment activities.",
  "care_description": "Chesapeake Bay Retriever dogs look like the picture of athletic elegance and require your moderate effort to keep them looking that way. Chessies need a ton of daily exercise, a balanced diet and a regular grooming and nail trimming routine to maintain their movie-star good looks and agreeable disposition.",
  "grooming_description": "Chesapeake Bay Retriever grooming is reasonably straightforward. Coming from a breed mix of Newfoundlands (heavy shedders) and Irish Water Spaniels (light shedders), these little bears got it just right with their low-maintenance grooming. Their harsh outer coat and soft undercoat need a thorough weekly brushing to keep their short hair healthy and ready for their close-up, though you'll want to bump that brushing up to daily during the spring and fall when Chessies blow their coats (aka shed their old coats to let their winter or spring coats come in). A fine wire slicker brush will do the trick every time for unruly curls.\n\nOutdoorsy Chessies need their nails trimmed every two to four weeks to avoid walking or running discomfort. Because they need their natural oils for a healthy coat and water resistance, don't bathe this dog more than every two months, and when you do, use a mild pet shampoo.\n\nTo keep Chesapeake Bay Retriever teeth in tip-top shape, brush them daily, and your vet should do a professional cleaning yearly. It's never too early to get your Chessie used to having their teeth cleaned. Make a game of it—through dental treats and flavored toothpaste—and your faithful friend will reward you with fuss-free toothbrushing.",
  "training_description": "Intelligent, loving and strong-willed—that's the Chessie in a nutshell. That can make training your Chesapeake Bay Retriever puppy challenging, especially for first-time pet parents. Professional Chessie training using positive reinforcement is strongly encouraged for this breed, and once you get the ball rolling (pun intended), they are eager to learn. Naturally, they excel at various dog sports. Food is a strong motivator for Chessies.\r\n\r\nSome Chessies can be prone to resource-guarding, so training is necessary to nip that undesirable behavior in the bud. And if you enjoy having friends, family and the occasional co-worker over, early socialization is a must for a well-mannered, stress-free pet. Socialization helps pups get used to meeting new people and other dogs, so they'll be more comfortable mixing and mingling as they grow up. Take your Chesapeake Bay Retriever puppy on walks and let them meet other dogs and people. Consider enrolling them in puppy school, where they learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new adults—all in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A healthy Chesapeake Bay Retriever diet consists of high-quality dog food. Before buying, be sure to factor in your dog's age and look for food that matches their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior).\r\n\r\nChessies are always on the go, so a high-protein diet best suits their lifestyle. But this doesn't mean that they can eat whenever they want—which, let's face it, means whenever there's food around. For optimum health and adherence to weight recommendations, you should set specific meal times, and Chessie size standards should determine their portion sizes. Treats, while a viable training method, should be kept to a minimum under any other circumstance. Yes, even triathletes need to watch their weight. Who knew?\r\n\r\nBe sure to consult with your veterinarian about your Chesapeake Bay Retriever's specific needs. After all, they are in the best position to determine the proper diet to meet your dog's lifestyle.",
  "exercise_description": "Tired of having workout partners who constantly make excuses for ditching exercise dates (my dog ate my shoes!) or who straight-up bail on you for that morning run? The Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog breed lives to exercise with a capital \"E.\" At the very least, Chessies need 30 minutes of intense daily activity to be happy and content. These dynamic dogs were built for endurance and strength and will spend countless hours playing outside, so a brisk walk around the block simply won't do.\r\n\r\nSwimming is an excellent activity to help your Chessie burn off all their energy. With their webbed feet and waterproof coat, these water dogs would happily splash the day away with you. You provide the pool or lake, and they'll provide the fun.\r\n\r\nApart from outdoor frolic and play, Chessies are excellent at dog sport-related activities, including hunting retrievals, field trials, rally, flyball, dock diving, agility and tracking.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Chesapeake Bay Retriever's ideal environment is a house on a lot of land with numerous lakes or pools and plenty of animals to hunt and retrieve. Not a tall order at all, eh? Barring that, they're happiest in a home where they have lots of room to run and play (and extra points if you do have a lake for them to swim in, though a pool will do in a pinch), with an active pet parent who loves to explore the outdoors as much as they do. Originally from Maryland, Chessies thrive in colder climates due to their oily, weather-resistant coat, so cold weather and cold water is no problem. Because of their high exercise needs and tendency to bark, apartment living is not ideal for these dogs, but a determined pet parent can make it work as long as they have access to a fenced, dog-friendly area where their pup can run.\r\n\r\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers can get along with kids, cats, dogs and just about anyone if properly socialized to co-exist. Still, you are looking for an easy-going lapdog, you are barking up the wrong tree or, in this case, swimming in the wrong lake.\r\n\r\nThe perfect match for this super-athlete is an equally energetic pet parent with the experience and patience to know when to curb a strong-willed streak and when to let the Chessie be their lovable, intrepid self.",
  "health_description": "Chessies have a life expectancy of 10 to 13 years, although they are prone to some health issues. Knowing about these potential health problems in advance can help your pup stay healthy for longer.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a skeletal condition, most prevalent with large or giant breed dogs. Signs include lameness, pain, and decreased activity. Treatments include lifestyle changes, joint supplements, medication and surgery in more severe cases.\nOcular Conditions: Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and cataracts. There are genetic screening tests for both conditions so ask your breeder. However, if you have any concerns about your pet’s eyes (redness, cloudiness, squinting, pain), please make an appointment with your vet right away.\n Exercise-Induced Collapse (EIC): EIC is an inherited intolerance to exercise. Affected Chessies become uncoordinated and wobbly after a short period of strenuous activity, with episodes lasting up to 20 minutes and completely subsiding after 30 minutes. As both parents must have the defective gene to pass it down to their pups, you can avoid this condition with responsible genetic testing.\nDegenerative Myelopathy (DM): This neurological condition causes older dogs to lose function in their hind limbs. Genetic testing by responsible breeders can help avoid the disease. While the test won’t guarantee that an affected dog won’t develop the disease, it is a good start.\nFollicular Dysplasia Alopecia: This genetic hair loss caused by a deformity in the follicle’s structure gives Chessies’ coats a shabby appearance. No effective treatment is available for this form of alopecia, although selective breeding can avoid the issue in the first place.\nVon Willebrand’s Disease (vWD): A protein deficiency (von Willebrand factor) that helps platelets stick together and form clots causes this inherited blood disorder. Some dogs may never show signs of vWD; others will bleed more profusely after surgery or injury. There is drug treatment available in some instances. You can manage most dogs with the disease by changing their lifestyle to avoid injury. Consult with your vet for options.",
  "history_description": "Descendant of Newfoundlands, Irish Water Spaniels and other undetermined dogs, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever originated with 19th-century duck club owners who bred these dogs to withstand freezing water conditions and retrieve hundreds of fowl per day. By the American Kennel Club's inception in 1884, Chessies already existed as an emerging breed.\r\n\r\nThe breed gets its name from the Chesapeake Bay on the east coast of Maryland, where they hunted migratory ducks and geese. Their waterproof, oily double coat, powerful legs and webbed feet enabled them to withstand the elements for hours.\r\n\r\nAs successful as they are as duck dogs, Chessies' speed, muscular build and keen sense of smell also make them excellent police K-9 dogs. At the same time, their athletic prowess and dashing good looks help them excel at dog sports and competitions.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. Depending on the breeder, Chesapeake Bay Retriever prices average between $900 and $1,500. For these Chessie puppy prices, you can rest assured you are getting premiere breed characteristics and a dog bred to avoid significant Chessie temperament and health issues. You can also reach out to a Chessie rescue organization, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
