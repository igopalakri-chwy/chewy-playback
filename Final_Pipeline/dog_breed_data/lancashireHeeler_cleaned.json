  "breed_intro": "The sturdy and compact Lancashire Heeler resembles a Doberman Pinscher that’s been left in the dryer a bit too long. Their upright, triangular ears match their alert demeanor, and their short, waterproof coats are fitting for a dog that’s always ready to answer the call to adventure.\r\n\r\nLancashire Heelers may look like lap dogs, but they were built for action—so don’t expect them to laze the day away. Originally bred to herd, this brainy, high-energy, attention-loving breed will keep you on your toes while securing a top spot in your heart.",
  "appearance_description": "Lancashire Heelers are short and squat dogs that look a bit like Cardigan Welsh Corgis.",
  "temperament_description": "Lancashire Heelers are working dogs trying to make it in a dogs-are-family world. So while they may look like the perfect couch companion, these whip-smart pups prefer mental and physical workouts over a lazy day of loafing.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Lancashire Heelers are loners. Their need for activity is rivaled only by their need for companionship, so nothing will make them happier than having you join them in heart-pumping activities.\n\nPastimes like neighborhood walks, games of fetch with a favorite toy, and learning a new skill combine all of their favorite things: mental stimulation, physical exercise, and attention from you!\n\nLancashire Heelers form deep bonds with their family members and tend to love children of all ages. Other pets can also become close friends, but it’s important to note that Heelers may try to chase small animals like rodents and rabbits.\n\nMoreover, because of their size, interactions between Lancashire Heelers and small children (who may not know how to be gentle) or large dogs (that also may not know how to be gentle) should be approached with caution to avoid accidents during play.\n\nThough they’re highly trainable and smart dogs, teaching your Lancashire Heeler puppy will take skill and patience. Herding instincts like barking are common and your pup will need constant guidance to be kept in check.\n\nLancashire Heelers are also typically reserved around strangers and will need time to warm up to new people. But properly socialized and well-trained Lancashire Heelers can be happy, adaptable dogs.",
  "care_description": "Lancashire Heeler dogs are short in stature but not in maintenance needs. Helping this historical herder thrive in your home will take time, patience, and lifelong training.",
  "grooming_description": "Like most working dogs, Lancashire Heelers need very little grooming. Their short, dense, flat coat is both waterproof and relatively foolproof when it comes to hair care. Two brushing sessions a week and an occasional bath should be enough to keep their coats in tip top condition.\n\nThough they shed moderately most of the time, Lancashire Heelers lose their undercoats twice a year (a process called “blowing coat”). Stray fur will be excessive during these periods, so you may need to ramp up your brushing—and lint rolling. Consider using an at-home dog grooming vacuum to help the cleanup.\n\nIn addition to coat care, regular nail trims and daily toothbrushing will help keep your Lancashire Heeler looking and feeling their best.",
  "training_description": "You can take the working dog out of the work, but you can’t take the work out of the working dog quite so easily. In other words, the Lancashire Heeler has many traits—such as barking—that served them well as herding dogs but could pose problems in a home environment. In fact, the United States Lancashire Heeler Club (USLHC) notes that the breed can become a “menace” if not properly managed.\n\nThe solution? Early exposure to different animals, people, environments, activities, and objects is the first step. This socialization can help your Lancashire Heeler puppy grow to feel comfortable, no matter the situation.\n\nIn addition to socialization, consistent rewards-based training can help Lancashire Heelers learn the skills they need to thrive as a family member, rather than a work colleague. Luckily, these dogs are smart and quick learners, but don’t underestimate how difficult it can be for them to toss their instincts to the wind.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Every Lancashire Heeler is unique, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all feeding plan for this pup. However, there are a few basic tips you can follow:\n\n \t• Choose a dog food that’s approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Ask your veterinarian for guidance.\nWhile the label on your dog’s food bag includes a feeding guide that can give you a general idea of how much to feed your Lancashire Heeler based on their weight, your veterinarian can provide a much more precise answer that considers your pet’s weight, age, body condition score, lifestyle, and health needs.\nA vet can also help you determine the proper feeding schedule.\nBe sure to factor treats into your Heeler’s daily calorie count. Treats should only account for 10% or less of your dog’s daily calorie requirements.",
  "exercise_description": "Don’t let their size fool you; Lancashire Heelers are gluttons for action! They need a job to be happy to burn off their excess energy.\n\nAnd while Lancashire Heelers were bred for certain jobs—namely, herding—they won’t mind channeling their efforts into other activities, which is great news if you don’t have any cows in your yard.\n\nInstead, try adding these activities to your regular rotation:\n\n \t• Long walks\nHikes\nFetch\nHide-and-seek\nObedience training\nSkills training\nAgility\nAKC Rally®",
  "ideal_environment": "Lancashire Heelers are compact, versatile dogs that can do well in many different homes thanks to their size. That being said, they typically fit in best with active families who have the time, energy, patience, and skills to provide constant training and daily exercise.\n\nAccustomed to working alongside humans, this dog breed doesn’t enjoy being alone for long. Bored, lonely Lancashire Heelers are more likely to engage in unwanted displays of their chewing and barking prowess.\n\nWhile Lancashire Heelers can be a friend to all, interactions with large dogs and very young children should be approached with caution. At a max weight of 17 pounds, these cute, playful dogs can look like toys, and well-intentioned but rough handling can cause accidental harm.",
  "health_description": "Lancashire Heelers are generally healthy dogs that typically live 12–15 years. But like all breeds, they are predisposed to certain health conditions. The breed club recommends testing for the following diseases:\r\n\n \t• Primary lens luxation (PLL): PLL describes when a dog’s eye lens moves out of its normal location. This dislocation can occur in one or both eyes. Signs of PLL include red, teary, cloudy, painful eyes. The condition can also cause inflammation and glaucoma, and can progress to blindness if left untreated. But if PLL is caught early, surgery to remove the lens can be helpful.\nCollie eye anomaly (CEA): In dogs with CEA, the blood vessels of the choroid (the layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball) don’t develop as they should and disrupt the flow of nutrients to the retina. This can cause blind spots, retinal detachment, and blindness. While there isn’t a cure for this condition, it isn’t painful and dogs with CEA can live long, full lives with a little extra help from their pet parents.\nPatellar luxation: One of the most common orthopedic conditions in small- and medium-sized dogs, patellar luxation occurs when the patella (kneecap) moves outside of its normal groove within the femur. Dogs with this problem may limp or hop to accommodate for the dislocation, and you may hear a popping or cracking sound coming from their knee joint. Not all dogs with a luxating patella need treatment, but surgery may be recommended in severe cases.",
  "history_description": "The origin story of the Lancashire Heeler is admittedly a bit hazy. But according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, their ancestors were likely 17th-century butchers’ dogs that drove cattle to markets in the Ormskirk region of West Lancashire, England. Sometimes referred to as Ormskirk Heelers, they also proved useful as early modern–era ratters, ridding their humans’ spaces of unwanted rodents.\r\n\r\nThough recognized by the United Kingdom’s Kennel Club in 1981, the breed remains rare. As a result, Lancashire Heelers were placed on their home country’s vulnerable native breed list in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Lancashire Heeler didn’t gain official AKC membership status until 2024. And interestingly, while there are several dogs that have the term “Heeler” in their nickname (for example, the Blue Heeler), the Lancashire Heeler is the only breed recognized by the AKC with “Heeler” in the official breed name. For this reason, you may hear these dogs referred to simply as “Heelers.”",
