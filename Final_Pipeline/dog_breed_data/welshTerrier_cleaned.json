  "breed_intro": "Ready to add some excitement to your life? Bring home a Welsh Terrier. This fun-loving breed is full of surprises—they'll happily play with their toys one minute, run around the yard chasing anything that moves the next, and then snatch your favorite sneakers when you aren't looking. Still, as mischievous as they can sometimes be, one flashy smile from their funny, fuzzy face and you'll forgive everything. (You know you're a softie at heart.) You love a good laugh, so you'll get a kick out of your Welshie's playful antics, keeping you in stitches throughout the day. But their affectionate nature means they'll also be just the companion you've been looking for at night when you both finally slow down. You'd been meaning to replace those ratty sneakers anyway, right?",
  "appearance_description": "Welsh Terriers' height, long-muzzled head and \"stuffed toy\" good looks can be deceiving. Beneath their adorable exterior, these energetic dogs are small powerhouses with the stamina to keep up with any task you throw their way. Their tails are always alert and upright, and they love nothing more than using their square noses to dig around for their next big adventure. These black and tan terriers will melt your heart when their sweet, fuzzy face looks up at you through alert, almond-shaped eyes.",
  "temperament_description": "The Welsh Terrier dog breed is affectionate with the people they love. They're outgoing, spirited and highly alert. No wallflowers here! On the flip side, they'll likely chase and bark after any little critter that moves.\n\nWelshies are not naturally aggressive, nor do they have strong biting tendencies. But as a hunting breed, untrained dogs (and sometimes even the trained ones) will chase after small animals, including cats, and fight back if challenged by other dogs. Pro tip: If buying or adopting two dogs at once, getting one of each gender may result in a smoother transition.\n\nA Welsh Terrier's fun-loving temperament can make them great pets who can co-exist beautifully with active parents. Raising a Welshie with kids is more of a mixed bag. The best chance for happy cohabitation depends on the young children's age at the time the dog enters the home (older than 6 is your best bet), and whether you provide diligent supervision and socialization—both for your dog, and to teach your children how to respectfully interact with them.\n\nA medium- or large-sized home with plenty of indoor and outdoor space—a big fenced yard, for example—to speed around in is ideal. They definitely need room to get the zoomies out. Small apartment living can also work, as long as you give your pup plenty of outdoor opportunities to race. But be warned: Due to their high energy and natural hunting tendencies, Welshies tend to jump on furniture to make room for play. They should always be on a leash when out in public, too.\n\nThis breed isn't the best choice for first-time dog parents as Welsh Terriers' intelligence and high energy levels demand above-average physical exercise as well as a ton of training and mental stimulation for them to thrive. Regardless, if a Welsh Terrier puppy has already won your heart, make sure they come from a reputable breeder and invest in a certified trainer to end up with the best Welsh Terrier qualities and a devoted forever friend.",
  "care_description": "The Welsh Terrier breed may look like a huggable, wiry-haired stuffed prize you won at the fair, yet surprisingly, they don't need a lot of brushing to keep them looking their cuddly best. They do, however, require plenty of daily activities and mental stimulation, a balanced diet, plus regular nail trimming and teeth brushing routines to keep them happy and healthy for a lifetime.",
  "grooming_description": "Don't be fooled by their scruffy appearance; in comparison to other double-coated breeds, the Welsh Terrier hardly ever sheds a wiry curl and is considered a hypoallergenic breed. Regular brushing with a long-bristled pin brush and three or four annual professional groomer visits for a haircut and beard trim are all you'll need to keep their coat tidy.\n\nFor a special Welsh Terrier grooming treat, book a hand stripping session where the groomer removes unruly hairs by hand. (This is how the pros prep their Welsh Terriers to compete in dog shows.)\n\nUnless your Welshie has stepped in something foul, bathing them three times a year with a mild shampoo will more than suffice. Between baths, a 50/50 mixture of medicinal mouthwash and water will kill germs and promote healthy skin and coat. Plus, they'll smell good, too.\n\nClipping your Welsh Terrier's nails is more than an aesthetic chore. Long nails can cause pain and trigger irreversible damage to your dog. In fact, they can turn a sound paw into a splayed foot, reduce traction, cause deformed feet and even injure the tendons over an extended period. You should trim nails once a month or as needed. When you hear them tapping on the floor, it's time to trim! If your dog fidgets, a groomer might prefer to grind the nails to sand them down slowly.\n\nLike most dogs who enjoy spending time exploring outdoors, Welsh Terriers need regular ear inspections—once a week is a good bet— to keep them clear and free from infection. If you see redness, swelling or debris, call your vet. They may advise you to clean your dog's ears.\n\nWelshie teeth need brushing daily (best to start from puppyhood, so they get used to toothbrushing early) with a proper toothbrush and dog toothpaste. Best Bully 12-inch sticks are both entertaining for your pet and will keep their molars clean. Finally, keep their teeth in top form and avoid tooth disease and decay with annual teeth cleanings at the vet.",
  "training_description": "Quick-learning and alert, but with a ridiculously high prey drive (we can't stress this enough), Welsh Terriers need significant amounts of obedience training to resist going after potential prey.\r\n\r\nPositive reinforcement methods (treats, toys and praise for a job well done) tend to work well for the easily distracted Welshie. So the first step after bringing home your Welsh Terrier puppy should be to hire a certified trainer who can motivate your dog and set them up for success.\r\n\r\nDespite being the friendliest of all the dogs in the Terrier group, these furry friends are also the most sensitive, with an attention span that wanes pretty quickly. Therefore, you need to commit to short but effective Welsh Terrier training sessions, five minutes at a time, multiple times a day.\r\n\r\nSocialization, aka introducing your dog to new people and experiences, is important to bring out the naturally friendly qualities of your Welshie. Start taking your puppy on walks around the neighborhood to meet new friends and enroll in puppy preschool where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\r\n\r\nUltimately, success will depend on your dog's unique personality combined with your ability to exude confidence. Your Welshie loves you, but make no mistake, they will try to run your household if you let them. If all else fails, thank goodness for sturdy dog leashes and a giant dose of patience. It's a virtue, you know.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A healthy Welsh Terrier's food diet consists of high-quality commercial dog food and thankfully, there are plenty of great options available. Before buying, be sure to factor in your dog's lifestyle and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior).\r\n\r\nDespite their active life, Welsh Terrier weight can easily increase if their diet is not carefully monitored. The struggle is real, even for dogs, it seems. Therefore, a high-protein, well-balanced diet will best suit their needs once or twice per day. At snack time, be creative with low-calorie treats—ice cubes are a favorite. But remember, healthy is best. Carrots, anyone?\r\n\r\nOverall, to keep them in tip-top shape and add years to your Welsh Terrier's lifespan, be sure to consult with your veterinarian about your diet or weight concerns. After all, a professional is in the best position to determine the perfect diet and lifestyle to meet your dog's unique dietary needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Welsh Terrier energy levels are sky-high, particularly when young. They're not the type of dog you can take on a brisk walk around the block then leave alone to snooze the afternoon away. Welshies benefit from lots of exercise and, when supervised—that is, on a long line or in a fenced area—they should be allowed to practice the hunting-related activities (i.e., flushing out and chasing vermin) for which they were bred.\n\nTo stay out of trouble, Welshies must be busy. You know what they say about idle hands (or, in this case, idle paws). They'll find a rousing game of backyard fetch or Frisbee toss particularly entertaining. They also can't get enough of toys that squeak (perhaps reminding them of prey). Toy brands that can hold up to a Welshie's strong teeth include Kong Toys, JW Pet Toys and Outward Hound. Apart from casual playtime, Welsh Terriers excel at dog sports, including rally (similar to obedience courses), flyball, lure coursing and barn hunt.",
  "ideal_environment": "As with most breeds, Welsh Terriers can get along with kids and other dogs provided they have all been raised together from a young age and with consistent training. Still, there's always the possibility their strong prey drive will show up—so you might want to cancel those plans to babysit your sister's new kitty. For a Welshie, the best-case scenario would be to live with active singles, couples or families ready to keep a close eye on their pet.\r\n\r\nTheir ideal living situation would be in a large house or farm with plenty of yard space for the fun, frolicking freedom to be their impish selves.\r\n\r\nThe perfect match for these unpredictable pets is an equally energetic pet parent with the experience, patience and good humor to know when to correct bad behavior with positive reinforcement (aka rewarding their good behavior with treats, toys and praise), and when to let these little clowns get away with harmless larks.",
  "health_description": "Welsh Terriers have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years and, in general, are a healthy breed. Still, Welshies can be prone to a number of health problems. It’s important to be aware of some common Welshie health issues that may affect your beloved pooch.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition in which the hip joint isn’t formed properly, causing instability of the joint and leading to pain. Though it’s more commonly linked to large breed dogs, the condition can also affect Welsh Terriers. Signs include limping, being slow to rise from laying down, “bunny hopping” or showing pain when walking. Responsible breeders are required to conduct testing with a recognized certification organization. Treatments for the condition include lifestyle changes, joint supplements, medication and, in severe cases, surgery.\nOcular Conditions: Eye conditions are quite common in Welsh Terriers, including keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), glaucoma (primary or secondary), as well as genetic (lens luxation) or age-related conditions (glaucoma) that may ultimately require surgery. Breeders are required to do annual evaluations and DNA testing to avoid inherited conditions in future offspring.\nEpilepsy: This is a change in electrical activity of the nervous system that leads to physical events (chewing, stiffening of the legs and body, tremoring, seizures) and severe episodes where a dog can lose awareness of their surroundings. This can be a very scary event to witness, and indicates that your dog needs to be examined by your vet right away. Many times, epilepsy can be controlled using medications, diet, and monitoring with examinations and bloodwork.\nAllergies: Like most terriers, Welsh Terriers are prone to allergies, mainly manifesting in skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, a severe immune reaction of the skin responding to allergens. Treatment includes immunomodulatory medication with the use of an antibiotic or an antifungal medication, depending on what infectious agent is identified by your veterinarian.\nLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This degenerative hip joint condition, which primarily affects small breeds, eventually results in a collapsed hip and arthritis. Mild cases can be treated with therapy, while more severe situations require surgery.",
  "history_description": "Welsh Terrier origins date back to the 1700s. Originally bred to mercilessly hunt and kill vermin, including rodents, foxes, otters and badgers, Welshies later ran in dog packs during fox hunts and were eventually primed to compete in dog shows.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh Terrier's history of having a hardwired instinct to chase small prey is still a large part of the modern Welsh Terrier personality. They excel at keeping pests at bay on a farm, but at home, they are affectionate pets who adore spending time with their loved ones or chasing pests in the yard.\r\n\r\nThings got official for the Welsh Terrier during the 19th century. The Kennel Club in London, United Kingdom, recognized Welsh Terriers as a breed in 1887 and, following the first exports in 1885, the American Kennel Club gave Welshies full recognition in 1888.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find the Welsh Terrier breed today? You can find a list of reputable breeders at the American Kennel Club's Marketplace or Welsh Terrier Club of America. Depending on the breeder, Welsh Terrier pup prices average between $800 to $1,200. For this cost, you'll typically get a Welsh Terrier who's been responsibly bred to avoid temperament and health issues. You can also contact Welsh Terrier rescue organizations to adopt a dog, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
