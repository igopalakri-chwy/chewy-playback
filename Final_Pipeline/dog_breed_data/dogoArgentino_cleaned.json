  "breed_intro": "Ever seen one of those short-haired white dogs with the beautiful black patch over their eye? If they were nearly as big as their person, it was probably a Dogo Argentino.  \n\nThese energetic pups can be all white, too (just like a Maltese), but they’re the opposite of a lap dog. First off, at 90 pounds or more, they’re too delightfully large. But more importantly, they have no time for dillydallying when there’s so much to see (and do!) in the world.  \n\nThese agile dogs need a lot of exercise and play, and if you offer them fun activities with lots of surprises thrown in (a fun trip to the lake, maybe?), they’ll return the love and loyalty in spades.",
  "appearance_description": "If the Dogo Argentino looks a bit serious at first, it’s probably just because they’re alert and planning their next adventure.  \n\nThese short-coated pups sometimes have a large black patch around one eye, and the Dogo Argentino size, along with their agility, is their greatest feature. They can be over 100 pounds, after all.",
  "temperament_description": "The Dogo Argentino breed is athletic and has an energy level to match. These dogs were built for speed, and their love of activity and exercise is one of their most admirable qualities.  \n\nBut so is their love for their favorite person—that’s you. Dogo Argentinos are loyal to a fault, and they’d do anything to keep you out of harm’s way. But don’t fall for the tough guy (or gal) exterior—these pups have a mushy side, too.  \n\nThey’re fun, energetic, and fearless, which is why they need a dedicated pet parent to properly train and socialize them so that they can live their best life. It’s not unusual to see them getting along famously with guests or enjoying a fun game of hide-and-seek with their family.   \n\nDogo Argentinos do have a mind of their own, and instinct might take over if they see a squirrel they’d love to chase up a tree. That’s why these active, determined dogs need a skilled pet parent who can show them that it’s OK to chill sometimes (as long as the day’s energy has been expended).",
  "care_description": "Dogo Argentinos don’t need a ton of time in front of a mirror fussing over their appearance, but they do need a dedicated pet parent who can show them the ropes when it comes to obedience training, socialization, and exercise.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Give your pup a bath every couple of months (but you can make an exception if they take a really dirty romp outside).  \nBrushing: Once a week, brush your Dogo with a curry brush. Your pup may experience heavier shedding as the seasons change (in the fall and spring), and they might need brushing several times a week then.  \nDental care: Help keep your pup’s teeth in shape by brushing them daily with a dog toothpaste. It’s a good idea to start when they’re a puppy, so they get used to the experience. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year. \nEar care: Check your Dogo’s ears when brushing their fur, as moisture and debris can build up and cause an infection. Signs to look out for include redness, swelling, debris, or a bad odor. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your vet, who may advise you to regularly clean your dog’s ears. \nNail care: Make sure you pay attention to your dog’s nails—if you hear them clacking on hard surfaces, it’s time for a trim.",
  "training_description": "When you’re training a Dogo Argentino, you can’t just wing it—these strong, intelligent dogs need a confident pet parent who can show them the ropes, and it requires a consistent commitment. \n\nStart  training and socializing your pup as soon as possible (if you bring home a Dogo Argentino puppy, that’s great, but if you adopt them when they’re older, you can still do it then). Always use positive reinforcement—praise, special treats, and toys—to teach your pup how to be on their very best behavior. \n\nAs you socialize your dog, calmly introduce them to the great big world—try car rides and neighborhood walks that safely expose them to new sounds and smells. They’ll love the exciting adventure of it all, and it’ll teach them that the world can be a lovely place.  \n\nA Dogo Argentino might not always be up for a crowded party or lots of guests, and who can blame them? Focus on creating calming, positive moments with people, and don’t rush the process. It’s OK (and expected) if it takes time for your dog to warm up to everyone.  \n\nLeash training and coming when called are important skills to learn early on, especially if you live in a city with a lot of stimulation and distractions, like squirrels and sirens—these can be sensory overload for an excited Dogo. If your 90-pound pup decides to chase a squirrel, it’s important that you have a good grasp and know how to corral them back to their calm self.  \n\nA certified dog trainer is never a bad idea, provided that they use positive reinforcement—your pup will probably enjoy their special training sessions.  \n\nIf you need assistance in any aspect of training, seek out a certified professional dog trainer in your area who specializes in positive reinforcement methods.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all optimal nutrition plan for your Dogo Argentino, but every pup needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards.  \n\nAlso choose a formula that’s made for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), and consider a large-breed diet, especially for Dogo Argentino puppies. You may also want to feed them a high-protein diet—your vet can help you decide.  \n\nDogos can sometimes develop food allergies, which can manifest in red or itchy skin and/or ears, so keep an eye out for scratching or signs of discomfort. If your dog has an allergy, you vet can advise you on how to change their diet to a novel protein or a hypoallergenic formula.  \n\nDon’t forget to calculate treats into your pup’s daily meal plan—you’ll be using them a lot for training. Treats should never be more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "This active pup has stamina, agility, and speed for days, so a slow 15-minute walk will never be enough. For that matter, three slow walks aren’t enough—these sporty dogs need at least an hour of intense exercise and activity every day.  \n\nHiking, running, or long games of fetch with a ball or flying disc are great options. They’ll love it if you surprise them with fun bonus activities every week, like a surprise swim at the lake.  \n\nDon’t forget about the mental stimulation, too. A bored Dogo is a grumpy Dogo who could compensate in ways that you (and your shoes) won’t appreciate. Using interactive feeding toys or teaching your Dogo to find treats you’ve hidden around your home is a good way to keep them busy and engaged. \n\nDogo Argentinos also love dog sports like agility trials, and you can also get them involved with scent work.",
  "ideal_environment": "This dog needs a large home with a big fenced-in yard and space to roam. They’re not homebodies, and they’ll expect you to go out and about with them.   \n\nBut that doesn’t mean they’re not family dogs—they are, and they’ll love spending time with you indoors, too. They just really need to stretch their legs and expend lots of energy each and every day.  \n\nThese loyal, smart dogs are kid-friendly when properly socialized and trained. Just make sure your kids know how to respectfully play with a Dogo, too. And because of their size, your pup should always be supervised around small kids and babies.",
  "health_description": "The typical Dogo Argentino lifespan is 9–15 years. Here are a few health issues to be aware of. \r\n\n\t• Congenital deafness: Dogo Argentinos may have congenital deafness in one or both ears. One study found that partial or total deafness affected as many as 25% of Dogos. This condition was often more prevalent in blue-eyed dogs and those who were all white, without a color patch. Take heart, though, as most deaf dogs acclimate well and lead a full, happy life. \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones doesn’t properly fit. It’s an inherited condition that can be made worse if a pup is overweight, and it eventually leads to arthritis and pain. More severe cases may require surgery, but the condition is often treated with medications, joint supplements, special diets, weight management, and/or physical therapy. \nHypothyroidism: Common in Dogo Argentinos, hypothyroidism includes symptoms like lethargy, hair loss, skin and ear infections, and weight gain. A blood test can diagnosis it, and treatment is a daily oral medication. \nSkin issues and allergies: The Dogo Argentino’s short white coat makes them more sensitive to sunburn. The breed can also experience skin sensitivities from allergies (both food and seasonal) or underlying health conditions. Get any excessive itching or redness and rashes checked by a vet.",
  "history_description": "The Dogo Argentino’s origins are relatively recent—they were first bred in 1928 in Argentina.  \n\nThey descend from a bunch of breeds, including the Great Dane, Pointer, Bull Terrier, Boxer, English Bulldog, Pyrenean Mastiff, Irish Wolfhound, Spanish Mastiff, and a local dog native to the Córdoba province. Initially used as hunting dogs, most Dogo Argentinos now lives as pampered pets who expend their energy in the great outdoors and in dog sports.   \n\nThe Dogo Argentino Club of America formed in 1985, and the Dogo joined the ranks of the American Kennel Club in 2020. \n\nDogo Argentino breeders charge upwards of $1,000 for a puppy. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also adopt a Dogo Argentino through a rescue like DC Dogos, as there are many patiently waiting for their forever homes. You can also keep an eye out at your local animal shelter or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
