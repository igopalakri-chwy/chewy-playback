  "breed_intro": "Even though their name means \"little lion\" in Mandarin, the playful Shih Tzu is a lover, not a fighter. Your pup will enjoy curling up on your lap at home as much as they will thrive basking in the adoration of passersby at the park. Once lapdogs to emperors, the Shih Tzu certainly looks the part of a royal, glamorous breed with their long, flowing silky coat. But make no mistake, while their coat is high maintenance, this intelligent and independent breed is full of surprises and capable of much more than lounging on pillows all day. In fact, they've been known to be a frontrunner in agility competitions. Never one to put on airs, your even-tempered Shih Tzu will get along with most everyone, other pets included. But you'll always be their No. 1.",
  "appearance_description": "Shih Tzus' faces are often compared to chrysanthemum flowers because their facial hair fans out like petals in every direction, including in front of their eyes if you let it. Their most distinctive feature is their luxurious, floor-sweeping coat, which comes in a variety of color combinations, often with black, tan or white markings, including a spot on their foreheads known as the Star of Buddha. Their innocent round eyes, trusting demeanor and small, compact stature give them the appearance of a cuddly plush animal, which along with their gentle nature has earned them their prized toy dog status over many centuries.",
  "temperament_description": "Small in size but big on personality, the Shih Tzu is adored by everyone they meet. An agile and adaptable pet, your pint-sized pooch will love cuddling with you on the couch in front of the TV, but they're equally happy trotting by your side in the park.\r\n\r\nA fun-loving breed, Shih Tzus enjoy playing with older children, who understand how to play gently with a small dog, and other four-legged pets as long as proper introductions have been made (they are descended from royalty after all). They aren't known for biting, but like any dog, they may bite if pushed too far in rough play. Be sure to teach all children how to gently interact with dogs, and to supervise your Shih Tzu puppy around young children who may mistake this adorable pup for their favorite stuffy.\r\n\r\nWith their ability to assess situations much faster than other small breeds, the Shih Tzu is so much more than a pretty face. They make excellent watchdogs; they are always on alert for someone approaching your home and will let you know they're coming. Even though they may exhibit a stubborn streak and require extra patience when training, they are worth the effort. Their loyalty and calm manner in all types of situations serve them in good stead as emotional support animals when their small size is not an issue.",
  "care_description": "Regular grooming is essential for showing off your Shih Tzu dog's luxurious long hair and keeping it out of their eyes. You may find yourself needing extra doses of love and care during training. But good news! It all balances out, as these low-shedding pups require less daily exercise than other dogs and can be just as happy playing hide-and-seek in your living room as chasing after a ball in the park.",
  "grooming_description": "The amount of grooming your Shih Tzu requires depends on the haircut you choose. If you really want to do justice to their piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance (that cascading, waterfall-like coat), you will be brushing them every day. Even if you keep a short-haired pup (about one to two inches all over), their coat still needs care about every other day. A pin brush is ideal for both cuts, so you can reach through all the layers of hair right down to their skin and keep their coat free of mats and tangles.\n\nYou also want to pick up a fine-tooth comb for their mustache and topknot, which you can either tie up into a snazzy little bow or have trimmed to a more manageable length by a groomer. And since they barely shed at all, you'll be able to catch most of those loose hairs when you brush them.\n\nTo keep them smelling good for all those cuddles you'll be getting, bathe your Shih Tzu every three weeks. This keeps their hair and skin healthy without stripping the natural oils from their coats.\n\nThe Shih Tzu dog breed often has either an underbite or an overbite, which makes them more prone to periodontal disease and other dental problems. So, it's important to keep their teeth healthy. While a yearly professional teeth cleaning by your vet is essential, don't forget to brush their teeth at home. Start your pup with toothbrushing once or twice a week and work your way up to daily brushing. You can also consider giving them a high-quality dental chew to help keep their pearly whites in great condition.\n\nIt's important to keep your Shih Tzu's nails short and trimmed every three weeks, as overly long nails can affect their gait, bleed when they break off or cause pain by piercing the soft pads of their paws. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear that familiar tappity-tap on hard surfaces.\n\nBecause they have no shortage of hair growing in their ear canals, Shih Tzus' ears often become a host to infections and parasites. Trim that excess hair (with rounded shears) and check their ears for redness, swelling and debris every week. If you notice any of the above, go to the vet for a check-up. Your vet may recommend cleaning their ears.",
  "training_description": "The lovable Shih Tzu dog breed is notoriously attention-hungry, so the key to getting them to do what you want is to lay it on thick with praise and rewards. With the right blend of consistency, gentleness and firmness, you can overcome your pet's stubborn streak. It's important to keep practicing commands (like sit, stay and come) and obedience throughout your Shih Tzu's life. But remember to use only rewards and positive reinforcement methods. As this breed is prone to anxiety, raising your voice can backfire and cause your pet to misbehave even more.\n\nBecause they have small bladders, housetraining can be particularly challenging. Taking your Shih Tzu out every few hours or immediately after having an accident can help them learn to associate going outside with potty time. Crating your puppy for short periods when you're not around to supervise them can also help. (Learn more about crate training here).\n\nPuppy training and socialization classes are highly recommended; the earlier you start, the better. Though they naturally want to please you, they still have a mind of their own and could make a mad dash across the street if they see another dog. So, it's important to keep your pup on a leash when outdoors. If you need assistance in any aspect of training, look for a certified dog trainer in your area.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Shih Tzus typically do well with any high-quality commercial dog food. It should be easy to pick up and chew since this breed usually has either an underbite or overbite. For this reason, dry kibble is often the preferred option, but with whatever you choose, be sure to factor in your dog's age for a formula appropriate to their stage in life (puppy, adult, or senior). You may also choose to make your pup's meals at home. If you do plan to go this route, run the meal plan by your vet to ensure your pup gets all the nutrition they need.\r\n\r\nLike most small breeds, Shih Tzus should be fed two or three times a day. You can help nourish your pooch's glamorous coat from the inside out, as well as support muscle mass and joint health through a diet high in fat and protein with the right balance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.\r\n\r\nBecause Shih Tzus are not high-energy dogs, they are prone to excessive weight gain, so it's important to limit the treats you give them. Be sure to check with your vet for the proper mealtime and snack portions. Your vet is in the best position to make nutrition recommendations based on your dog's unique needs.\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget to keep your pup's bowl clean and filled with cool, fresh water throughout the day; they may be more thirsty than usual if they're on a dry food diet.",
  "exercise_description": "Bred to be the lapdog of emperors, the Shih Tzu is more well-suited for your air-conditioned living room than the rugged hiking trails of the great outdoors. That said, they do need some daily exercise to manage their moderate energy levels and stay healthy, though much less than what is required for bigger breeds.\n\nTaking your dog out for two to three 20-minute walks a day will help keep their bodies fit, and their minds entertained. Any longer may be difficult for this short-legged breed to endure. (Watch out for signs of exhaustion like heavy panting or lying down on the ground and refusing to budge.) Because they're moderately sensitive to heat, avoid the hottest times of the day for your walks and make sure to bring some water along, as well as a vessel for your pooch to drink from. Conversely, you'll want to dress them up in a fleece or jacket in the wintertime and keep their exposure to the cold to no longer than 15 minutes.\n\nSwitch up your daily routes for your Shih Tzu to experience different environments, like an open field or a sandy beach, and bring their favorite rubber ball for them to chase. Giving your Shih Tzu lots of opportunities for indoor and outdoor play will stimulate their minds as well as their bodies. You don't want this curious pup to get bored, as it can lead to behavioral problems like chewing on things around the house or even excessive barking.",
  "ideal_environment": "Shih Tzus are really in their element as long as they get to be with you. Whether that's part of a large family with lots of kids and four-legged pets, or just the two of you and a Netflix marathon, these companion dogs are happy just being by your side. But take note: Shih Tzu puppies should be supervised when playing with small kids and babies; this toy breed's small stature can make them vulnerable to injuries.\n\nThey can be good for new pet parents who are consistent with training (that royal strong-willed streak!) and are home often. A Shih Tzu will suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for long periods; if you're going to be gone for awhile, take your pup to doggy daycare or schedule a play date with a neighbor or friend.",
  "health_description": "The Shih Tzu has a life expectancy of 10 to 18 years and can be susceptible to a range of health issues. It's important to be aware of potential health problems, so you can help your pup live their healthiest life possible.\r\n\r\n \tLiver Shunts: Shih Tzus are more likely to develop a liver shunt called portosystemic shunt (PSS) that prevents toxins from being removed from their bloodstream. This can lead to symptoms such as seizures or stunted growth. Ask your vet to test your pooch's blood for this issue and conduct an ultrasound liver scan. Sometimes diet and medication may be enough to treat this disorder, but in other cases, your Shih Tzu may require surgery.\r\n \tBone and Joint Problems: Shih Tzus suffer from a few bone and joint problems, including patellar luxation and hip dysplasia. Patellar luxation is the condition where the kneecap slips out of place. Mild cases may be treated with joint supplements and pain medication, though surgery may alleviate more severe symptoms. Hip dysplasia causes the hip joints to form improperly and can lead to arthritis. Symptoms can include bunny hopping, limping or pain. A vet can diagnose it with X-rays and identify the right course of treatment which may include weight management, medication or, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tEye Problems: Eye conditions that could affect your pet include dry eye, glaucoma or cataracts. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don't produce enough tears. Signs of dry eye include a thick discharge or pawing at the eye, and it can typically be treated with ointment. Glaucoma and cataracts both can lead to blindness if left untreated. It's important to screen your Shih Tzu for these conditions as early as possible so they can be diagnosed and treated with medications and surgery as recommended by your veterinarian.\r\n \tKidney Disease: If your Shih Tzu has inherited glomerulonephropathy, their kidneys may fail at an early age. Clinical signs include lack of appetite, vomiting, increased drinking, increased urinating and weight loss. Your vet may recommend annual or semiannual bloodwork and urinalysis to check the health of your pup's kidneys and identify any issues early. However, if your pet is showing any of the symptoms, please make an appointment right away.\r\n \tBrachycephalic Syndrome: Smoosh-faced cuties like Shih Tzus have anatomical changes to their nose and throat that make them prone to overheating and having trouble breathing. If your pet is experiencing any trouble breathing, see your veterinarian immediately.",
  "history_description": "Though their earliest ancestors can be traced as far back as 1000 B.C. in China, Shih Tzus as we know them in modern-day times originated in Tibet. These luxury lapdogs were given as gifts to Chinese royalty and were a favored house pet during the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.).\r\n\r\nThey were later bred with Pekingese or Pugs in a world-famous breeding program that fell apart when its founder, Empress Tzu Hsi, died in 1908. As a result, their numbers dwindled to only seven males and seven females, which were then used to rebuild the breed. Every Shih Tzu dog alive today is descended from one of those last 14 pups.\r\n\r\nAfter they were exported to England and other European countries, American soldiers stationed overseas brought the pups back to the US in the 1940s and 1950s. Since they arrived in the West, Shih Tzus have become a highly coveted breed, receiving American Kennel Club recognition as a member of the toy group in 1969. Famous celebrity pet parents include Bill Gates, Beyonce, Mariah Carey and Queen Elizabeth II.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Shih Tzu as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Shih Tzu price? Expect to spend anywhere from $1,200 to $3,000 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Shih Tzu rescue organizations, keep an eye out at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.\r\n\r\nHave you seen teacup Shih Tzus online? Neither the AKC nor reputable breeders recognize these really small dogs. These pups have been bred for their small size and are often unhealthy. Sadly, these pups are touted as being \"rare,\" so they cost more. If you see a breeder who has these types of dog, find a different breeder.",
