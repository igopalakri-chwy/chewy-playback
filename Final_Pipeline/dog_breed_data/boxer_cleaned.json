  "breed_intro": "The strong, athletic Boxer dog breed might look intimidating from afar, but up close, they are silly, outgoing and the life of the dog park. And let's not forget about their adorable full-body wiggle. Loyal and protective, the Boxer makes a great family dog. One look into their sweet, human-like eyes, and you might just fall for this fun-loving, easy-going breed.",
  "appearance_description": "Handsome and agile with a shorter muzzle and dark, soulful eyes, peak-condition Boxers have a muscular build and gleaming short coats. Their colors include fawn shades that vary from light tan to mahogany or brindle (aka black stripes on a fawn background), and they can also have white markings. The Boxer's tail is often docked and their ears cropped, although more pet parents are leaving Boxer ears in their natural, floppy state, which certainly seems to suit their playful personality.",
  "temperament_description": "With their muscular physique and dark eyes, Boxers might seem tough and serious. But don't be fooled! The ability to make many two- and four-legged friends is one of the Boxer's greatest strengths. Silly pups at heart, they're like a kid in a dog's body, which may explain why Boxers and kids get along so well. They'll never cease to put a smile on your face with their clown-like antics. You can often catch them sitting with their rear legs out in front of them (like people) and rolling back into a lazy dog position. They're also prone to zoomies and stopping on a dime to dole out sloppy, wet kisses. If your dream dog is athletic and affectionate, the Boxer's for you.\r\n\r\nOften described as being more human than dog, Boxers are known to be quite sensitive. They'll work 24/7 to please their loved ones, but this desire to please means they can get their feelings hurt. (Sad puppy dog eyes warning!) Originally bred to serve as guard dogs, Boxers perform brilliantly as service, assistance and therapy dogs, and in roles such as drug detection and search-and-rescue. However, some Boxers may not get along well with dogs they don't know and of the same sex.",
  "care_description": "Exuberant, playful and sensitive, Boxers require a good deal of exercise and training. But the extra effort is worth it thanks to their good nature and charming personalities.",
  "grooming_description": "Brush their coat: The Boxer dog breed's short hair and shiny coat, which sheds most in spring, requires very little grooming. Brushing your Boxer a few times a week using a rubber curry brush or a hound glove can help keep shedding in check and keep the coat healthy and tight to the skin.\n \tClean their teeth: Speaking of brushing, brush their teeth daily to prevent tartar buildup and dental disease.\n \tBathing and nail trimming: Unless they get really dirty, Boxers only need to be bathed once a month. Turn it into a doggy spa day and trim your Boxer's nails at the same time (unless they get naturally worn down on hard surfaces).",
  "training_description": "Training is a great way to provide physical activity and mental stimulation, which are especially important for Boxers. Originally bred as a guard dog and wild game chaser, they're energetic, smart and prone to jumping and leaping, especially when they're young. Boxer puppies may nip when they play, which may be cute when they're puppies, but they have a powerful bite force as adults, and their play biting will not be so cute. So, a Boxer puppy will benefit greatly from early socialization and dog training classes. (You'll for sure want to teach them the \"down\" command.)\n\nThe good news is Boxer dogs are highly trainable due to their intelligence and excellent problem-solving skills. A training regimen with plenty of fun and positive reinforcement works best, as they can become bored with repetition (and remember, they can get sad if they feel they've let you down).\n\nCanine sports such as obedience, agility and herding are all great options for burning off that Boxer energy. Interactive toys, puzzle games and scent work (which teaches a dog to identify and track various odors) also can keep Boxers mentally stimulated throughout their life.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Boxers do well on high-quality, complete and balanced commercial diets. To determine if a dog food is complete and balanced, look on the package for a statement that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).\r\n\r\nBreed-specific diets, like Royal Canin Boxer dog food, can help satisfy a Boxer's unique needs by providing, for example, the optimal amount of protein to maintain muscle mass and nutrients that contribute to good heart health. (Boxers are prone to heart issues. More on that below.)\r\n\r\nWhatever diet you choose, it should be appropriate to your dog's age (puppy, adult or senior) because Boxers have different nutritional needs at different life stages. As puppies, they'll benefit from diets that support their growth and immune system, like Royal Canin Boxer dry puppy food. At around 6 or 7 years old, they may need to transition to a senior diet to help manage their weight, which can become an issue later in life. Be sure to speak to your veterinarian, as they can help you choose the best food for your dog based on their activity level, weight, age and unique needs.\r\n\r\nTreats can be an effective training aid but giving too many can cause obesity. Treats shouldn't make up more than 10 percent of a dog's diet. And of course, your Boxer should always have access to clean, fresh water.",
  "exercise_description": "Boxers are smart, active dogs who need exercise every day, whether it's a few walks and runs to release energy or several hours a day in a secure, fenced-in area. Well-trained Boxers make great running companions for short, brisk runs when the weather is moderate. Because Boxers are speedy (they're one of the fastest dog breeds and can reach speeds of over 30 miles per hour), experts recommend pet parents keep them on a leash. Boxers also love to play fetch. Growing Boxer puppies should be exercised less than adults. You don't want to cause injury or damage development.",
  "ideal_environment": "Boxers need room to roam, so apartments may not be ideal. A house with a big yard for activity and exercise would be best, but living in an area where long walks are possible will also suffice. Also, Boxers don't like extreme temperatures. They should be kept inside the house as a cherished member of the family, where they'll likely claim a section of the couch or bed if you allow it.\r\n\r\nOverall, Boxers do well in family households, but because they are playful and high-energy, they're not a great choice for a frail adult or a home where very small children might be frightened by a well-intentioned but jumpy puppy.",
  "health_description": "Boxers have a life expectancy of 10-12 years, but they're also prone to some health issues that can limit their lifespan and mobility. It's good to know what those potential health problems are in advance, so you can keep them healthier longer. \r\n\r\n \tHeart Defects: Some Boxers are born with congenital heart defects. Later in life, they can develop a genetic heart muscle disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or ARVC. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is also common in Boxers and can lead to heart failure. This condition causes the heart to enlarge and the walls of the heart to thin, leading to inefficient pumping of blood. Regular vet checkups and Holter monitoring (a portable device that monitors heart activity) from middle age onwards can prolong a Boxer's life. \r\n \tUlcers: Eye ulcers are a common condition in Boxers. Signs are extreme tearing, squinting and redness. If you suspect your Boxer has an eye ulcer, take them to a vet who can diagnose and treat it. \r\n \tDegenerative Myelopathy: This incurable degenerative neurological condition spreads through the spinal cord and can leave a dog unable to walk when they get older. Subtle dragging of the hind legs is often the first sign dog parents notice. A doggy wheelchair can help improve mobility and quality of life. \r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Boxers have a predisposition to this skeletal condition in one or both hip joints. If your Boxer has trouble getting up from sitting or navigating stairs, it can be an indication of the disease. A veterinarian can diagnose hip dysplasia with an examination and X-ray. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include physical therapy or surgery. \r\n \tAortic Stenosis: This health condition, which refers to a narrowing at the heart's aortic valve, is hereditary and occurs in large-breed dogs. It is often detected as a heart murmur during a routine physical exam but is diagnosed through an X-ray and echocardiogram. In mild cases, the dog may not need treatment. In moderate to severe instances, medication may be needed. Most often, exercise is limited in Boxers with this condition. \r\n \tCancer: Unfortunately, Boxers are prone to several different cancers, including hemangiosarcoma and lymphosarcoma, as well as other tumors. Having a good vet who is in tune with your dog's health history is essential. \r\n \tDental Issues: Sometimes, Boxer teeth do not come in when expected, which can cause painful cysts to form that damage the dog's jawbone. Boxer underbite, when the upper jaw is shorter than it should be, can be common. If the upper incisors dig into the lower jaw, teeth will have to be extracted. \r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland is no longer producing enough thyroid hormone. This can lead to changes that may include (but are not limited to) lethargy, weight gain, skin changes, reproductive problems and neurological problems. Hypothyroidism is typically managed with a daily thyroid medication that replaces the missing hormone. \r\n \tGastric Dilitation-Volvulus (GDV): GDV is a problem that is most prevalent in large, deep-chested dogs. When GDV occurs, the stomach fills with food or gas and then twists, cutting off the blood supply to the stomach and adjacent structures. This condition can be rapidly fatal and requires immediate emergency treatment. Prevention may include feeding smaller more frequent meals (often from a slow-feeder bowl) and limiting exercise before and after feeding times. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend performing a surgical procedure called a gastropexy, which can secure the stomach to the chest wall and limit its ability to rotate.",
  "history_description": "The sleek Boxer we know today can be traced back to Medieval Germany. It was bred down from the larger German breed, the Bullenbeisser, or bull biter, whose forte was hunting ferocious game like bear and wild boar. Fun fact: The Boxer's ancient ancestors were Assyrian empire war dogs and can be traced back to 2,500 BC. The name \"Boxer\" comes from the breed's English fans and is a nod to how the breed plays or defends themselves with their front paws, similar to how a human boxer spars.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Boxer in 1904, and the breed's parent club, the American Boxer Club, was formed in 1935. A jack-of-all-trades, Boxers have been athletes, cattle dogs, police dogs, war dogs (in both World Wars), watchdogs, protection dogs and guide dogs for the blind. Boxers have been one of America's most popular breeds since the 1950s. That's when a dog named Bang Away won at the Westminster dog show and became known throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in making a Boxer part of your family, the cost ranges from $800 to $2,000 for a purebred Boxer puppy. It's important to check the bloodline and choose a reputable breeder that does health testing. You can also reach out to a Boxer rescue organization to adopt a Boxer, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are Boxer dogs hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Boxers are not considered hypoallergenic. Even though their coat is short, they do shed. The good news is they require little grooming. Some people are allergic to a dog's saliva, and because a Boxer grooms themself with their tongue, the saliva can get onto their fur and into the air when they shed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Boxers drool?",
      "answer": "Yes, Boxers do drool. Because Boxers have drooping jowls, they produce large quantities of saliva. Most Boxers don't drool all the time, but expect excess drool after exercising."
