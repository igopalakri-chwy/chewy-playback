  "breed_intro": "You're packing your gear for a weekend camping trip when your beloved Bearded Collie scampers over and pricks their ears in anticipation. There's no question—they're coming with you. These dogs are as rambunctious as they are smart, so they're always up for a new adventure, whether it's a quick trip to the store or a long hike in the woods. Plus, they're herding dogs, so you can count on them to keep tabs on your family and friends, too. You smile to yourself knowing this weekend's going to be full of fun and excitement—for both you and your dog.",
  "appearance_description": "The first thing you'll notice about a Bearded Collie is their shaggy double-coat bouncing in the wind as they run toward you with agility and speed. But beneath that abundant mane is a surprisingly lean dog for their size. Weighing in around 50 pounds when full-grown, these rambunctious pups peer out from their bangs with shining, inquisitive eyes that reflect their desire to be with you. Their coats range in color from black or gray to light brown, and your pup's color may change as they grow up.",
  "temperament_description": "Inquisitive and independent, Bearded Collies are born leaders. These highly intelligent dogs thrive on activity, so you'll want to keep their minds and bodies busy. Otherwise, if they get bored, Beardies might come up with their own list of fun activities (think: herding friends and family, stampeding wildly through the house or destroying the furniture).\r\n\r\nLike Border Collies, Beardies were bred for herding sheep. Their herding behavior can be an issue in chaotic households with young kids and other animals. But this doesn't mean they can't excel in family homes. In fact, your ever-alert Beardie will eagerly steer friends and family out of danger. With early training, you can help your Beardie know when it's OK to use those herding instincts. It's also a good idea to teach children of all ages how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBearded Collies are rambunctious at all ages, which can be entertaining for friends and family. These athletic dogs love chasing, playing and running alongside you while doing everything from hiking to running errands. Instead of being left at home while you jog, Beardies would love to come with you. There's no such thing as too much activity for these pups.\r\n\r\nBearded Collie dogs' high energy level and keen intelligence can sometimes lead to a bit of a strong-willed streak, especially in training. It's not that they don't want to obey; they just think their way is better. Starting their training and socialization while they're puppies will help them see that you're pretty smart yourself.",
  "care_description": "Bearded Collies are incredibly smart, but that doesn't mean they don't need help from their human families. This medium-sized dog needs lots of exercise, daily grooming and plenty of human interaction. As independent thinkers, they thrive with firm structure and expectations so that they don't stray too far off course.",
  "grooming_description": "Bearded Collies have a soft undercoat and a long, somewhat rough outer coat. They shed all year long, but your vacuum cleaner will work harder in the spring and fall when they shed more. If you keep your Beardie's coat long, you may want to opt to use a barrette to keep their hair out of their eyes. Some pet parents give their Beardies a haircut to reduce maintenance. Shorter coats are easier to brush, but be aware of potential matting. Here are some more grooming tips for your Bearded Collie:\n\n \t• Brushing: You should give your pup a quick daily brush to keep the tangles at a minimum. This will take about 10 minutes, if you keep your Beardie in a long coat, and even less time for shorter coats. Keep a towel and brush handy inside the door to wipe them off when they come in from frolicking in the backyard, and your daily detangle can become a fun, natural bonding experience instead of a chore. You'll want to give them a more in-depth brushing once a week, using a pin brush to get the tangles out and a boar bristle brush to smooth and shine their coat. You may also find a slicker brush and de-matting comb handy, too. This more thorough brushing will take 30-60 minutes.\nEar cleaning: While you're giving your pup their weekly brush, check your pup's ears for debris, wax build-up and signs of infection (redness or swelling)—because these pups are prone to ear infections. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nBathing: If your Beardie's a show dog, you'll be giving your pup a weekly bath. Otherwise, they'll be happy with a bath once every four to six weeks. Some veterinarians recommend bathing your Beardie no more than once a month to avoid skin damage.\nNail trimming: You'll know your Beardie's nails need a trim when you can hear them clicking on the floor. Some Bearded Collie puppies need nail trims every other week, while others wear down their own nails with everyday running and playing.\nDental care: Just like you, your Bearded Collie dog will stay happy and healthy with daily teeth brushing. And don't forget to schedule an annual professional cleaning by your vet (not a groomer).",
  "training_description": "The Bearded Collie dog breed is highly intelligent and energetic. Take advantage of their natural smarts and energy and start training your puppy as soon as they come home. Your Bearded Collie puppy will probably pick up the basics—sit, come and stay—very quickly. Use lots of rewards—treats, praise and play breaks—to let them know they're doing a good job.\n\nBecause Beardies are herding dogs, they are inherently prone to offer direction rather than take it. They also learn quickly, which could lead to boredom and distraction during training sessions. Keep sessions energetic, moving on to new skills and tricks as soon as the dog has mastered one. And remember: Despite their instinct to push limits, these dogs want to please you.\n\nSocialization is important for this naturally friendly dog. Introduce them to new people and other dogs, beginning as soon as you bring your Bearded Collie puppy home. Take them on walks to meet new friends in the neighborhood and enroll them in puppy school. Here, they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people—all under one roof.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There's no one-size-fits-all feeding chart for the Bearded Collie breed. You'll need to factor in your dog's stage of life (puppy, adult, senior) into the variety you choose. Look for the statement that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nMost Bearded Collie dogs do well on a high-quality commercial dog food diet with a few treats thrown in—but remember that treats can be high in calories, which can lead to obesity and the health issues that accompany it, so keep a careful eye on your dog's weight. Because Beardies are so active, they might benefit from a high-protein dog food formula.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, chat with your veterinarian. They are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Bearded Collies need lots of time to run around outside for their mental and physical health. Aim for about one hour each day. If you're not able to get their wiggles out every day, these pups are creative and will come up with their own fun games, like \"let's chew the Manolos\" or \"tearing out the bushes.\"\n\nBeardies enjoy long walks or jogs and frequent adventures to the dog park. They'll appreciate fun games in the backyard, like fetch, too. If you're into competition, sign up for dog sports. These pups excel at agility, rally and herding.\n\nAs you exercise their bodies, don't forget their minds need stimulation as well. Teach them fun tricks, like play dead or shake, and give them interactive dog toys to play with around the house.",
  "ideal_environment": "Bearded Collies can thrive in a fast-paced environment of any size. Their ideal living space? A family home with a large, fenced-in yard. A sprawling lawn gives Beardies the chance to run and play outside, where they and the kids (or fellow pets) can tire each other out.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a smaller home or apartment, you can still fulfill your dreams of having a Beardie as a pet. As long as you can meet their daily exercise needs—yes, that means even on rainy or snowy days—they will do just fine with apartment life.\r\n\r\nHerding breeds like Bearded Collies are popular with families because they're friendly, athletic and have a distinct look that'll make them the star of the neighborhood. They're a good choice for a first-time pup parent, too. However, it's important Beardies are included in your daily activities, not left by themselves for most of the day. A Beardie pup left home all day while the kids and parents rush off to their activities could cause chaos by coming up with chewing, digging and other ways to stay busy at home.",
  "health_description": "Bearded Collies are a generally healthy breed with a life expectancy of 12-14 years, but they are prone to a few health issues. Look out for these Bearded Collie health conditions in advance so you can keep your pet healthy and happy. \r\n\n \t• Autoimmune Diseases: Bearded Collies are prone to developing autoimmune diseases, such as hypoadrenocorticism (Addison’s disease), hypothyroidism, pemphigus, low platelet (ITP) or red blood cell count (IMHA). If your vet suspects an autoimmune disease, they will probably order blood tests. Most autoimmune diseases are treatable with medications. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Bearded Collies are less prone to joint issues than giant breed dogs, however, researchers have found that about 5 percent of Beardies develop hip dysplasia, a condition where the hip joint is malformed causing the joint to be loose. Symptoms of hip dysplasia include limping, pain or decreased mobility. Treatments typically include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, physical therapy and, in severe cases, potential surgery. \r\n \t• Eye Problems: Bearded Collies are prone to eye problems, including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Cataracts can often be treated with surgery, but there is no treatment for PRA.  If you suspect your pup is having trouble with their vision, please check with your veterinarian.",
  "history_description": "The Bearded Collie breed's origin and history can be traced back to the Scottish Highlands, where the dogs were raised to help shepherds by herding and driving sheep across the rugged land. The dogs were prized for their energy, wit and stamina—they worked long days. Because of their role and geography, they were often called Highland Collies or Mountain Collies. Somewhere along the line, these humble herding dogs found their way into the homes of the Scottish elite. They became quite fashionable, even appearing in portrait paintings with their families. By the early 1800s, the Bearded Collie types had developed a rather standard look, temperament and set of traits that match the breed of today. Beardies were a well-kept secret of the Scottish Highlands; they made their way to the United States only in the mid-20th century. The American Kennel Club formally recognized the breed in 1983.\r\n\r\nSo, where should you look for Bearded Collie puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The cost of a pup can range $1,500-$2,500. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you're interested in adopting a Beardie, reach out to a Bearded Collie rescue organization or your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
