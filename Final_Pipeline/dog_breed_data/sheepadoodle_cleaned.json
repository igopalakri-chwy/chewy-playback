  "breed_intro": "If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to share your home with a living, breathing teddy bear, look no further than the Sheepadoodle, a fluffy Old English Sheepdog-Poodle mix.\n\nThe Sheepadoodle’s long, wavy locks are easy on the eyes but not on the grooming routine, so expect to spend quality time brushing your pup every day. If you’d like less coat to care for, you might prefer a Mini Sheepadoodle, which is a cross between an Old English Sheepdog and a Miniature Poodle. They offer all the perks of their standard-sized counterparts in a more compact companion.\n\nIn addition to sporting the cuddliest coat, Sheepadoodles have a mind and body built for play. You’ll need to schedule time for exercise, training, and mental stimulation, too.",
  "appearance_description": "Because Sheepadoodles don’t have a breed standard, their appearance is less predictable than other established dog breeds. But they typically have long, thick, wavy fur with a black-and-white pattern, like an Old English Sheepdog with a perm.\n\nThis fur tends to extend to a Sheepadoodle’s endearingly floppy ears and often obscures their dark, friendly eyes. But regular grooming visits (and using hair ties) can help improve their vision!",
  "temperament_description": "The Sheepadoodle’s parent breeds were both bred to work, and their offspring have the wits, athleticism, energy, and training aptitude to prove it. However, that doesn’t mean they can’t excel as family pets, too—just be sure to give them a daily “job” (like exercise) and plenty of attention. \n\nEvery dog is different, but properly socialized and trained Sheepadoodles are every bit as fun and loving as they look. They’re quick to make friends with people of all ages, though very small children may not be ready for a dog of their size and zest. Sheepadoodles can even pal around with other pets—cats included. \n\nOnce your Sheepadoodle dog is good and worn out, you can expect a ready and willing cuddle partner who’s equipped with the perfect coat for maximum coziness.",
  "care_description": "Sheepadoodles are dogs with big hearts and big appetites for exercise. Both their body and their brain need a daily workout.\n\nThe Sheepadoodle’s thick, wavy coat is a work of art—emphasis on work. But on the plus side, you couldn’t ask for a more lovable dog to groom. Your daily upkeep sessions will be one-on-one time well spent.",
  "grooming_description": "While doodle mixes like the Sheepadoodle are often recommended to people with dog allergies as a hypoallergenic pet, no dog can truly claim that label. And though Poodles shed very little, Old English Sheepdogs lose a lot of fur. So, there’s no guarantee that your Sheepadoodle won’t shed or make you sneeze.\n\nWhen considering a Sheepadoodle puppy, know that your grooming to-do list will include:\r\n\n\t• Brushing: Odds are high that your Sheepadoodle’s coat will be prone to matting, so prepare to provide daily brushing with a slicker brush or pin brush. However, regular visits to the groomer for shorter cuts can reduce the time you spend on hair care. \nBathing: How often you bathe your dog depends on how they get their exercise (for example, brisk jogs on the sidewalk versus swimming in ponds), but keep in mind that overbathing can strip their skin of healthy oils. \nEye care: Use brushing and bathing sessions to check on your Sheepadoodle’s eyes. Reach out to your vet if you have any concerns.\nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails every month or so. If you can hear their claws clack as they walk, it’s time for maintenance.\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth every day using a dog-safe toothpaste and toothbrush. This is the best way to prevent dental disease.\r\n\nStart a grooming routine when your Sheepadoodle is a puppy so that by the time they’re older—and tougher to wrangle—spa days are no big deal.",
  "training_description": "It’s important to start safely exposing your Sheepadoodle puppy to new experiences—including animals, people, environments, activities, and objects—as soon as you bring them home.\n\nThis socialization process can help your dog feel comfortable in a wide variety of settings and lets their friendly, outgoing personality shine. Talk to your veterinary team about age-appropriate socialization for your dog. \n\nBoth of the Sheepadoodle’s parent breeds are whip-smart and eager to learn. These attributes served them well as working dogs.\n\nHowever, if your dog favors their Old English Sheepdog parent, you may encounter a bit of willfulness during the training process. Don’t take it personally. Old English Sheepdogs were bred to work independently in the field, so they might need more encouragement. \n\nSpeaking of which, like all dogs, Sheepadoodles respond best to consistent rewards-based training. And because both their intelligence and energy are so high, it’s best to keep training as engaging and active as possible—like a game.\n\nIf you aren’t up for the task, consider signing your Sheepadoodle puppy up for a training class, or enlisting the one-on-one help of a professional trainer at any age and stage of your dog’s life.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Nutrition is complex, so it’s helpful to partner with your veterinarian in determining your Sheepadoodle’s diet. They can help you find a food that meets Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) standards and is nutritionally complete for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), size, lifestyle, and health.\n\nMost adult Sheepadoodles should eat twice a day. Because these dogs are prone to bloat and gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), consider following these mealtime tips to help reduce their risk:\r\n\n\t• Use a slow-feeder bowl to prevent your dog from eating too quickly.\nRestrict exercise for at least an hour before or after your dog eats.\nAvoid raised food bowls. \nProvide smaller meals throughout the day.\r\n\nDog treats can be a great training tool, but only in moderation. They should never make up more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "The Sheepadoodle’s appetite for action won’t be satisfied by a quick trot down the block twice a day. And if your dog is bored with energy to spare, they’ll be more likely to engage in unwanted behaviors like barking and chewing. \n\nYour Sheepadoodle will need about an hour of exercise every day. Here’s a list of dog-approved activities to get you started: \r\n\n\t• Hiking\nLong walks\nJogging (in cool weather)\nSwimming\nFetch\nObedience training\nSkills training\r\n\nRegardless of which activity you and your pup pick, be sure it takes place either on a leash or within a securely fenced area. Sheepadoodles can follow their hunting and herding instincts into danger!\n\nAnd once your Sheepadoodle is adequately exercised, you’ll be rewarded with the sweetest, softest cuddle partner you could ask for.",
  "ideal_environment": "Standard Sheepadoodles are big dogs, so a home with lots of space, and room to romp and roam (like a fenced backyard), can make life easier. However, both Standard and Mini Sheepadoodles can do well in apartments, as long as you offer them enough exercise and attention. \n\nAs you may have guessed, the Sheepadoodle coat is excellent in cooler climates, but it can make for a very hot dog in warm weather. When dealing with the latter, shorter haircuts and shorter amounts of outdoor exercise can help. \n\nWhen properly socialized and exercised, Sheepadoodles are gentle and friendly with people of all ages. However, due to their size and energy, all interactions with very small children should be closely monitored so no one gets accidentally knocked over during play. \n\nSheepadoodles can also get along with other pets in the home, though it’s best if they’re able to grow up alongside their furry family members. Otherwise, they may see fellow pets as creatures to herd or chase.",
  "health_description": "The average Sheepadoodle lifespan is 12–15 years. They’re considered a generally healthy crossbreed, but like all breeds, they’re predisposed to certain health conditions.\n\nPartnering with your veterinary team to monitor your pet for signs of common problems is an important part of caring for your Sheepadoodle pup. \r\n\n\t• Bloat: Bloat in dogs occurs when gas and/or food cause the stomach to expand. Sometimes, bloat progresses into a condition called gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), in which the dog’s stomach twists and cuts off blood flow to and from the stomach and the spleen.\r\n\n\t• GDV is painful and a life-threatening emergency, and the signs include retching or dry heaving without vomiting, swollen abdomen, sudden anxiety, pacing, panting, drooling, and collapse. If you notice any of these signs, get immediate veterinary care.\r\n\nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition in which the hip joint doesn’t develop properly, and it’s characterized by a looseness that leads to arthritis if left untreated. Mild cases are treated with interventions like physical therapy and joint supplements, while severe cases may require surgery.\nProgressive retinal atrophy: Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is when the rods and cones of the retina deteriorate. Signs of disease include a reluctance to enter dark spaces, clumsiness, and cataracts. There’s no cure for PRA, and the condition eventually leads to blindness.",
  "history_description": "While the Sheepadoodle crossbreed is a relatively new creation—likely originating around the 1990s—the parent breeds’ origin stories go back hundreds of years.\n\nOld English Sheepdogs have a misleading moniker. First developed in the 18th century, they aren’t an ancient breed. Nor are they fully English, as they likely have some Scotch, European, and Russian ancestors. And finally, they aren’t even sheepdogs; they were mainly used to move cattle from fields to markets.\n\nPoodles have their own muddled history, because while they may be the national dog of France, the breed was developed in Germany. And though their elegant appearance eventually made them a popular choice for wealthy French households, Poodles were originally bred to be duck retrievers.",

    {
      "question": "Do Sheepadoodles bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Sheepadoodles can bark more than other breeds—a holdover from their herding and hunting instincts. However, providing early, positive training and plenty of daily exercise and attention can help reduce barking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are Sheepadoodles so expensive?",
      "answer": "Responsible breeding that prioritizes health over profits involves time, resources, genetic testing, and regular veterinary care. These costs are reflected in the Sheepadoodle’s price, which can be $1,000 or more."
    },
    {
      "question": "How big does a Sheepadoodle get?",
      "answer": "Full-grown Standard Sheepadoodles, which are a cross between an Old English Sheepdog and a Standard Poodle, can grow to be 65–85 pounds and 16–22 inches tall. Full-grown Miniature Sheepadoodles, which substitute a Miniature Poodle for the Standard, can grow to be 25–45 pounds and 15–20 inches in height."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is better, a Sheepadoodle or a Goldendoodle?",
      "answer": "Both Sheepadoodles and Goldendoodles are wonderful dogs. A better question to ask is, “Which dog is better for my particular family?” The breeds have similar energy levels and are both exceedingly smart and friendly, but the Sheepadoodle’s coat may require a bit more effort and be less forgiving in hot climates."
