  "breed_intro": "This water-loving pup will probably weigh more than your child—and maybe even you—but don’t let that intimidate you. Newfoundland dogs are big softies, literally and figuratively.   \n\nNewfoundlands adore the outdoors, and they arguably love water more than fish do, so expect to come home with a very wet (and possibly muddy) pup. It’s all worth it to see these huge canine kiddos live out their mermaid dreams.  \n\nAnd if you haven’t gotten around to meeting your neighbors yet, just take your Newfie on a walk—this friendly dog will be delighted to introduce you to everyone in your path.",
  "appearance_description": "Full-grown Newfoundlands typically weigh at least 100 pounds. With a dense, heavy coat, Newfies carry their head proudly, and their tail hangs straight when they’re relaxed.  \n\nMost of the time, Newfoundland dogs have coats that are black or black and white, but they also come in brown and gray.",
  "temperament_description": "Newfoundlands are known for their patient and gentle demeanor. They love being with their people and are naturally friendly with strangers.  \n\nJust like all dogs, Newfoundland puppies need early socialization (or as early as possible, depending on what age you bring them home). Exposure to new people, places, and things will help them take on the world without fear.   \n\nSocialization will also teach them how to play with other pups—your Newfie will probably not understand how big they are, and someone’s got to tell them! Consistent training will help your Newfoundland grow up to be a confident, well-adjusted dog. And because they’re quite bright, your Newfie will probably pick up cues quickly.   \n\nThe sweet-tempered Newfoundland makes a great family dog, as they typically get along well with kids of all ages, even the littlest babies and toddlers. Unfortunately, young ones sometimes mistake a Newfoundland for a pony and think they can ride them, so teach kids that dogs prefer pets, not rides. (This kind of behavior can also aggravate health problems like hip dysplasia, so it’s important to avoid it.)   \n\nIn general, though, these gentle giants make any home a happier place.",
  "care_description": "Newfoundlands need a lot of love and care. What else would you expect from a dog the size of a teenager? They shed a lot and drool a lot, so grooming is key. However, while they will definitely enjoy hanging out with you, they don’t need a ton of exercise.",
  "grooming_description": "There are two things to know about Newfies and grooming: First, they shed. Second, they drool. The drool is the simplest to manage—just be sure to keep a towel handy to clean their face (and your furniture). Their other grooming needs are a little more involved.  \n\n\t• Bathing: Newfoundlands love being in the water, so you may not need to bathe your dog as much as other breeds during the summer—unless they decide to take a romp in the mud. In general, give your Newfie a bath every six to eight weeks. It can take several hours to thoroughly dry a Newfoundland’s coat, even with a dog-approved hair dryer, so bathing might be a great job for a pro groomer. \nBrushing: Newfie dogs shed year-round, but they take it up a notch twice a year in the spring and fall. To manage shedding and keep their coat healthy, brush your Newfoundland at least once a week with a slicker brush, followed by a long-toothed comb to get rid of mats. Brush daily during shedding season, and have a good vacuum cleaner ready.  \nDental care: Brush their teeth daily. Start early if you adopt them when they’re young; they’ll get used to it faster when they’re a puppy. Get a professional dental cleaning at your vet once a year. \nEar care: Their heavy, floppy ears are prone to bacterial infections, so watch for redness, swelling, or debris, and contact your veterinarian if you notice anything unusual. Your vet may recommend cleaning your dog’s ears regularly on your own.  \nNail care: Trim your Newfie’s nails. You’ll know it’s time for a trim when you hear their nails clacking on hard surfaces (roughly every two to four weeks).",
  "training_description": "Train and socialize your Newfoundland as a puppy (or as early as possible, if you adopt them as an adult), even if you don’t have children or smaller pets. An adult Newfie can weigh as much as 150 pounds, so it’s important for them to learn good manners (though most of these gentle giants are happy to do so).  \n\nThe Newfoundland is quite bright and curious. When you train them, use positive reinforcement—that is, treats, toys, and praise; as with all dogs, negative reinforcement can have poor consequences and do a lot more harm than good. Your dog will probably love clicker training, but they’re smart enough to learn almost anything you want to teach them.    \n\nThey’ll probably pick up quickly on cues like sit, stay, and come, even as young as 8 weeks old. If you’d like some help, a certified trainer who uses positive reinforcement can work with you and your pup. \n\nAlthough a Newfoundland dog’s size is massive, the breed is also gentle. These patient pups are good with children, provided that both children and dogs are taught how to behave around each other. These kind giants may forget how large they are, so supervise playtime.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for Newfoundlands to follow, but every pup needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Also choose a formula that’s made for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), and consider a large-breed diet, especially for Newfoundland puppies.  \n\nYour veterinarian can help determine the best diet and feeding times for your Newfie. Don’t forget to calculate treats into your pup’s daily meal plan—they should never be more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.  \n\nTo help prevent bloat in this breed, feed your pup smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day and use a slow feeder to keep them from woofing it down. Never use elevated food or water bowls, and don’t let your Newfoundland exercise for the hour before or after mealtimes.",
  "exercise_description": "Newfoundlands were bred for water rescue and enjoy having a purpose, but they don’t need a ton of exercise. They’re not known for their speed, and running long distances can actually hurt their joints.   \n\nAbout 30 minutes of activity every day works, whether it’s a long walk, a leisurely hike, or a dip in the pool. Agility trials, dock jumping, flyball, or tracking competitions may also be a good fit for this breed. \n\nKeep in mind that Newfies tolerate cold weather much better than warm weather—they are from Canada, after all. So, plan your walks during cooler parts of the day during the summer (morning and evening) and make sure your Newfoundland always has fresh water available, especially when temps rise.",
  "ideal_environment": "Newfoundlands don’t require a ton of extra space to roam, but pet parents should consider that everything is bigger with a Newfie—from their beds to their crates. That means you’ll need more space in your home than you would for a Yorkie or Shih Tzu.   \n\nThe Newfie is happy to welcome friends to their home—as long as everyone doesn’t mind a little drool. They’re friendly with just about everyone and everything, cats, small dogs, and kiddos included. However, these giants may forget how large they are and could accidentally knock over a child, so always watch over playtime. \n\nNewfoundland dogs do best in colder climates, but they can acclimate to warmer weather. Always have fresh water available, and a strong AC unit doesn’t hurt, too.  \n\nThese dogs love swimming, so your Newfie would adore a nearby body of water where they could take a daily dip. \n\nLastly, these giant pups are best for an experienced pet parents who can be diligent about training to ensure they learn the very best manners.",
  "health_description": "The average Newfoundland dog lifespan is 9–10 years, as large dogs sadly don’t live as long as smaller pups. Here are some health issues to be aware of: \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Newfoundlands, like many large breeds, are prone to a life-threatening condition called gastric dilatation-volvulus, a severe form of bloat. It occurs when the stomach gets distended with air and/or food and twists, cutting off blood supply to the organs. Symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately.  \nTo reduce the chances of GDV, use a slow feeder and offer your dog smaller meals throughout the day instead of one big dinner. Keep their food bowls on the ground (don’t elevate them) and don’t exercise one hour before or after meals. A preventative gastropexy procedure might be a good idea, too.  \nElbow and hip dysplasia: Elbow and hip dysplasia are genetic conditions that develop during puppyhood when the joints don’t align well and become looser than normal. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or, in severe cases, surgery. \nHeart disease: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), or an enlarged heart, is one of the most common heart diseases in large-breed dogs. When the heart enlarges, it results in thin and weakened heart muscles that can lead to heart failure.  \nCystinuria: Cystinuria is a genetic disorder that causes an amino acid called cystine to form in the urine, leading to kidney and bladder stones. Symptoms include straining to urinate, peeing frequently in small amounts, having accidents at home, and blood in the urine. This is a medical emergency, and treatment may involve diet changes, medicine, and/or surgery, depending on severity.",
  "history_description": "Fishermen relied on these dogs because of their partially webbed feet and natural swimming abilities; they assisted in water rescues and hauled fishing nets ashore. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. \n\nToday, the dog appears on 10 different monuments across the U.S., and it’s easy to see why: In 1802, Lewis and Clark took a Newfoundland named Seaman on their famous expedition. Multiple presidents have had Newfies, including James Buchanan, Ulysses S. Grant, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Senator Robert F. Kennedy even had a black Newfoundland dog named Brumus, whom he took to work with him.  \n\nA Newfoundland puppy can cost up to $3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also go the route of Newfoundland adoption. Look for a Newfoundland dog rescue, such as the National Newfoundland Rescue; keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter; or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
