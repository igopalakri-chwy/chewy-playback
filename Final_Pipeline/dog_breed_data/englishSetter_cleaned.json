  "breed_intro": "English Setters never seem to take a bad photo—just look at that coat! But these dogs aren't all glammy and Instagrammy; they enjoy a bit of rough-and-tumble play as well. And while they do love a grand outdoor adventure, they're perfectly happy with a long walk and games of fetch with you where they can get their wiggles out. And really, having their BFF (that's you!) with them is really the deciding factor—if you're going, they're going. And if you're staying in, they will, too. They're just delighted to be your sweet sidekick.",
  "appearance_description": "The medium-sized English Setter breed oozes elegance and is the picture of strength, stamina and pure grace. They have a flat coat with feathering on their ears, chest, legs and tail. English Setter dogs are generally white with speckles, known as ticking or belton. Blue or orange belton is the most common type.",
  "temperament_description": "English Setters are happy-go-lucky pups who are gentle and affectionate and great with kids; they think everyone they meet is their best friend. These guys will be your biggest fan, so make sure to invest in a comfy dog bed and put it in the center of the action as they're happiest when surrounded by the love and laughter of their people, both day and night.\n\nThese pups are great playmates for kids, and they're more than happy to join other dogs in the home. While they're born hunters, they can get along with cats as long as they're raised with them from puppyhood. But expect these dogs to chase smaller pets, like rabbits and hamsters; they may be a challenging addition if you keep critters at home.\n\nEnglish Setters are alert and protective and make great watchdogs. They won't hesitate to sound the alarm when someone unfamiliar approaches, but once settled, they're just fine—they tend to return to a state of calm pretty quickly too.",
  "care_description": "It's just a fact that a dog with such a gorgeous and luxurious coat is going to be high maintenance, and the English Setter is true-to-form. While they shed a moderate amount, their coat care, training and exercise needs will require a lot of your attention. But hey—it gives you more time to love on your pup.",
  "grooming_description": "English Setters have a soft silky coat with medium-length hair on their body. While shedding is not a big issue, they should be brushed at least once a week to prevent tangles and mats on the areas where their hair is feathered. Pet parents should use a soft-bristled brush for weekly grooming, and for areas where their hair is feathered (underbelly, legs and tail), a long-toothed metal comb will help detangle those long, silky strands of hair. Moreover, a bath every four to six weeks should keep skin healthy and their coat looking clean. When it's bathtime, check their nails; they may be ready for a trim. Bonus: the bathwater will soften the nails, making them easier to cut. A good rule is if you can hear their nails tapping as they walk, it's time for a trim.\n\nWhile pet parents should brush their pup's teeth daily to keep tartar and gingivitis at bay. When raising an English Setter, pet parents should get their dog used to teeth brushing while they're a puppy, so it's easier to do once they've grown up. Plus, your dog should get a professional cleaning by your vet at least once a year.",
  "training_description": "English Setters rank high for intelligence, so they're relatively easy to train. But the pups were bred as hunting dogs, so they may think they're smarter than you and know better. Starting while your English Setter's a puppy and being patient will win them over. Be sure to reward them with treats, praise and fun playtimes with special toys when they do a good job (aka positive reinforcement).\n\nStart your puppy with the basics, like sit, stay and come and be sure they know how to walk nicely on a leash. These will help you manage their hunting instincts (like chasing), but it's important to remember that you won't train these traits completely out of your pup.\n\nIf you find your English Setter puppy doesn't take to potty training easily, be patient. You may find crate training to be helpful, as it limits access to your entire house. Like with the rest of their obedience training, patience, consistency and lots of positive reinforcement are the keys to successfully housetraining your dog.\n\nBe sure to start introducing your puppy to new people, other dogs and situations while they're young. These experiences will help their naturally friendly nature shine. Take them on walks and introduce them to new people and dogs and enroll in puppy preschool. Here, they'll learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all under one roof.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Like most dogs, high-quality commercially available dog food should suffice for your English Setter. Choose a formula based on their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior), and look for the statement that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\n\nPet parents should know that English Setters are prone to obesity, so maintaining a healthy weight is important. Extra pounds can lead to health problems down the road, like heart disease. And while treats can make everyone happy, it's important to remember that they have calories, too; be sure to include them in your daily meal plans.\n\nIf you have questions about your pup's diet, chat with your veterinarian. They're in the best position to help guide you when picking the right food for your English Setter based on their unique needs.",
  "exercise_description": "English Setters have a high energy level, and they require daily exercise. Plan on spending about an hour every day dedicated to burning their energy reserves. While pet parents who have an active lifestyle will find they have a great buddy for running and hiking, it's not a deal-breaker for pet parents who aren't so active. Like many dogs, a long walk twice a day with your furry companion should be more than enough. Playing games like fetch in the backyard or at the dog park are also great ways to give them the activity they need. If you're a bit competitive, you and your pup may enjoy dog sports, like agility or tracking.\n\nThese dogs are born to hunt, so any off-leash activity needs to be in a controlled environment, like a fenced yard or dog park. Otherwise, your nose-first pup may catch wind of something that needs chasing, and they're off speeding away from you! Even with all the expert training you'll give, these pups will be laser-focused on their quarry. And no amount of calling or begging will get them to pay attention to you. So, for their safety and your mental health, always have them on a leash when out and about.\n\nIt's important to note that the English Setter breed doesn't fully mature until they're about 2 years old. Protect their growing bones and joints and don't include them in strenuous activities until after they've stopped growing. It's a good idea to check with your vet before engaging in a new activity.",
  "ideal_environment": "English Setters thrive in the hustle and bustle of a loving family—whether that's a home with a gaggle of kids or just you. They enjoy being around a lot of activity, so they'll be happy welcoming guests to your home for a summer BBQ. While they may bark at strangers, they're not barky, like a Silky Terrier, and they'll quiet down fairly quickly. These guys are great with kids and other dogs, and with proper socialization, they'll even get along with cats. But English Setters will chase small pets that look like critters—hamsters, rabbits and gerbils beware. And they're relatively easy to train, making them a good choice for someone looking for their first pet.\n\nThese dogs really need a home with a fenced yard where they can run around and get all their wiggles out. They're not ideally suited for smaller homes, like apartments, but if you're able to give them the daily exercise they need (either at a dog park or on leashed walks), you may find they do well in tinier abodes.",
  "health_description": "Bred as sporting dogs, English Setters are quite hardy. While they have a life expectancy of 12 years, there are a few health issues and problems that potential English Setter pet parents should be aware of.\r\n\n\t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: With hip and elbow dysplasia, the bones that make up the joints in those areas don’t form correctly, causing pain for your pup. Common symptoms of hip and elbow dysplasia include limping and an unwillingness to play. Treatment includes medication, physical therapy and surgery in severe cases.\nHypothyroidism: Dogs who suffer from hypothyroidism have an underactive thyroid. This condition can lead to weight gain, lethargy, excessive shedding, hair loss and itching and redness of the skin. Hypothyroidism is typically diagnosed with a blood test and managed with daily medication.\nDeafness: Deafness is another health condition commonly seen with English Setters, especially if they are all white. It’s important to remember that dogs can live full and wonderful lives despite being deaf.",
  "history_description": "The origin of the English Setter goes back centuries where records indicate they were trained bird dogs in England. (The term “setter\" refers to the seated or crouched position these dogs assume when they discover game; they lay down quietly or “set.\") However, the history of the modern English Setter begins in the 19th century where the breed was first developed by Englishman Edward Laverack and Welshman R.L. Purcell Llewellin.\n\nAt one point, English Setters were referred to as Laverack or Llewellin Setters, a name clearly reflecting their lineage. But eventually, the roads diverged for this breed. The Laverack line became known as the show-dog type, and the Llewellin line was prized for their field qualities.\n\nEnglish Setters were one of the first nine breeds ever registered in America and joined the American Kennel Club when it was founded in 1884. As part of the Sporting group (dogs who work with hunters), English Setters have retained their popularity since their introduction.\n\nWhile Setters are sometimes mistakenly believed to be one breed that includes English, Irish, and Gordon Setters, these three types of dogs are, in fact, three separate breeds with different traits and characteristics. The English Setter, for example, is slightly smaller than Irish Setters or Gordon Setters, and they are known for being more gentle as well.\n\nIf the English Setter sounds like a match for you, you can find reputable breeders on AKC Marketplace. The average price for a puppy is around $700 but can go up depending on the pup's lineage and pedigree. For that price, you're likely getting a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to English Setter rescue organizations, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
