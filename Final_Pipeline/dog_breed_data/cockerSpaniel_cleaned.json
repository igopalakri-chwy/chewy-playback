  "breed_intro": "American Cocker Spaniels are very pretty—but if they know it, they’re not letting on. These kind, unassuming dogs have lovely, floppy ears that fly in the wind when they run.  \n\nWhile they’re not the most active dogs in the world, they still enjoy expending their energy on fun sports, like agility training or flyball. Cockers are also heavy shedders, so it’s up to you to schedule lots of brush time; you can do it while you snuggle on the sofa and watch a movie in the evenings.  \n\nAt the end of the day, these gentle pups love their outdoor playtime, but they love cozying up to their favorite person just as much.",
  "appearance_description": "Think of the leading “lady” in the Disney film “The Lady and the Tramp,” and you can easily picture a Cocker Spaniel: They’re sweet dogs with long eyelashes, shampoo-commercial ears, and flowy hair on the rest of their body. Their round eyes are gentle and welcoming, often giving off a “puppy eyes” vibe.",
  "temperament_description": "Cocker Spaniels are generally happy dogs who get along with most two- and four-legged friends. This makes them a great companion for families with kids and babies or other pets. Some Cocker Spaniels make good therapy dogs, too, but it will depend on your pup’s individual temperament. \n\nGentle and loving, Cocker Spaniels enjoy the company of their humans. They’ll generally want to be wherever you are and won’t stray too far away. While they’re usually pretty laid-back, Cocker Spaniels are not couch potatoes and enjoy playtime with you. Many may also like dog sports like agility training.",
  "care_description": "Those locks need consistent brushing to keep tangles and shedding at bay, but the moments you spend grooming your pup—along with training and socializing—will also give you lots of quality time together.",
  "grooming_description": "Taking good care of this breed’s long fur is a nonnegotiable. Begin a grooming routine with your Cocker Spaniel puppy early in life, if possible, so they get used to regular baths and brushing.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: If you bathe your pup at home, use a high-quality dog shampoo and rinse it out completely to avoid skin irritation. Bathing too often could also lead to skin irritation; once every few weeks is usually best unless your dog decides to take a romp in the mud.  \r\n\n\t• Pro Tip: Take special care when drying your dog’s ears, as trapped moisture can create an infection (and ear infections are common with this breed).  \r\n\nBrushing: Be gentle when brushing your Cocker Spaniel. A metal dog comb, like this Frisco comb, will help you dislodge any mats. As double-coated dogs (long guard hairs on top of a soft undercoat), Cocker Spaniels shed a lot. A pin brush or slicker brush will help with that.  \nDental care: Teeth should be brushed daily. You can ask your vet if they recommend dental chews as well.  \nNail care: Nails should be trimmed once every three to four weeks; specific timing depends on whether your pup engages in activities that might naturally wear their nails down, like spending lots of time outdoors.",
  "training_description": "Both Cocker Spaniel puppies and fully grown adults tend to be easy to train. These smart dogs are also natural people-pleasers, so they catch on quickly and respond well to positive reinforcement—think treats and praise as rewards.  \n\nYou can teach your Cocker Spaniel cues like sit, stay, and roll over, but also include activities like agility training or scent work. These will engage your dog’s physical as well as mental needs.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Choose a complete and balanced diet that’s AAFCO-approved for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). You can even find food made just for Cocker Spaniels. \n\nSome pups develop sensitivities to specific ingredients; if that happens, your vet can help you figure out if you need to adjust their diet. Your vet can also help you decide how much and how often to feed your pup, including treats.  \n\nTreats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "Cocker Spaniels aren’t as energetic as the famously active Australian Shepherd, but they do need to have their energy needs met. They’ll enjoy a good snuggle on the couch, but Cockers also need to engage in daily games of fetch and other fun activities.  \n\nPlan for at least two walks a day (about an hour total) and make room for other types of play. Dog sports like agility or nose work are excellent ways to see your Cocker Spaniel in action.  \n\nTheir speed can be surprising for their size, so agility or flyball, a team sport that involves jumping hurdles and catching a ball at the end, can be fabulous outlets.  \n\nMental exercise is a must for your Cocker Spaniel, too. Food puzzles are an easy way to provide that mental stimulation and reward your pup with a little treat. Or, you can also play hide-and-seek by putting food in different boxes and letting them sniff it out.",
  "ideal_environment": "Cocker Spaniels are adaptable and can make themselves at home in an apartment in the center of town or in the middle of the countryside. But they don’t necessarily need a yard to roam; what’s most important is that you spend time playing and exercising with them.  \n\nThey do tend to bark, but you can work with a positive-reinforcement trainer to help curb that, if necessary.  \n\nCocker Spaniels won’t greet strangers as openly as the exceptionally friendly Labrador Retriever, but they are kind, gentle, and happy pups—they might take just a moment to warm up to new people. Cockers usually do well with kids, other dogs, and cats once proper introductions have been made.  \n\nThese pups are good for a first-time pet parent, if you’re willing to spend the time grooming and training them.",
  "health_description": "The typical Cocker Spaniel lifespan is 10–14 years, and there are a few health issues to watch out for.  \r\n\n\t• Ear issues: A Cocker Spaniel’s ears are long, fluffy, and adorable, but they can trap moisture inside, which can lead to many issues. Thoroughly drying their ears after baths or outside playtime can help. If you think your pup has an ear infection, talk to your vet; they may also recommend weekly ear cleaning to prevent infections.  \nEye issues: Cocker Spaniels can develop a handful of eye conditions. \r\n\n\t• Cataracts are the most common eye problem in Cocker Spaniels, and they can be hereditary. Surgery is the go-to treatment.  \nAnother concern is progressive retinal atrophy, which is the degeneration of the retina that can lead to blindness. While there’s no treatment, dogs often adjust well to vision loss with a little help from their pet parents.  \nLess serious, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye, can look like red and irritated eyes and is typically treated with eye medication.  \r\n\nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones don’t properly fit together. It’s an inherited condition that can be made worse if a pup is overweight. Hip dysplasia eventually leads to arthritis, and treatment depends on the severity. \nLuxating patella: Cocker Spaniels can develop luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can help prevent this condition. \nSkin issues: A Cocker Spaniel’s skin can get oily, so seborrhea and dermatitis are common issues. A thorough rinsing after bathing can prevent some skin problems. Your vet might also recommend medication or a shorter Cocker Spaniel haircut to help.",
  "history_description": "Spain is widely considered to be the Cocker Spaniel’s country of origin. Here, they were first bred as hunting dogs, and their ancestors were considered either “land” or “water” spaniels. Eventually, those groups became more nuanced, and the dogs known for hunting the woodcock became the Cocker Spaniel.  \n\nCocker Spaniels were one of the first breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), in 1878. But a distinction between Cocker Spaniel breeds—the Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel—didn’t come until 1946.  \n\nThe 1950s were a good time for Cocker Spaniels in America. They were the most popular breed of the decade, according to the AKC. This likely had something to do with then-Vice President Richard Nixon’s Cocker Spaniel, Checkers, and the popularity of the movie “Lady and the Tramp,” in which Lady is a kind, charming Cocker Spaniel.  \n\nThe cost of a Cocker Spaniel puppy can be as much as $3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also search for a Cocker Spaniel for adoption, as there are plenty out there in need of good homes. Find Cocker Spaniel rescue dogs through a breed-specific organization, such as Abandoned Angels; keep an eye out at your local shelter or rescue; or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
