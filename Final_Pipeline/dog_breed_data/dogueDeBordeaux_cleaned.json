  "breed_intro": "Thinking about adding a Dogue de Bordeaux to your home? You better have a king-sized bed! While this large-and-in-charge breed (also called the French Mastiff) may look intimidating with their massive heads and drooly jowls, they actually want nothing more than to snuggle up with their people—morning, noon and night. Prepare to be noticed when out on walks with this gentle giant, as their impressive size makes them hard to miss, though these pups are more interested in what you're doing than in meeting new people. If the perfect end to your day includes the 3 Rs—rest, relax and repose—then slide on over and make some room for the Dogue de Bordeaux.",
  "appearance_description": "With their massive wrinkly heads and expressive eyes, the Dogue de Bordeaux is a sweet and sensitive soul. While the Dogue de Bordeaux's strong, muscular body and no-nonsense expression beg for them to be taken seriously, it's hard to be intimidated by their drooly, lovable face.",
  "temperament_description": "Tom Hanks may have been upstaged by his co-star in the classic 80s movie \"Turner & Hooch,\" but IRL Hooch would be content to let you steal the show. The Dogue de Bordeaux (also known as the French Mastiff, and the breed that played the lovable aforementioned Hooch) is a calm and mild-mannered pup who is more interested in being your devoted pal than being on the A-list.\n\nWhile generally gentle and laid-back, Dogue de Bordeaux can be strong-willed and watchful. (They were used to guard French estates back in the day.) Proper socialization and training at an early age are necessary to make sure your puppy doesn't become overly fearful or reactive toward people they don't know. Working with a certified trainer can help ensure your puppy grows up to be friendly and confident.\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux breed can get along with other dogs, cats and kids—if trained properly and/or they grow up together. Children should be taught how to interact gently and respectfully with dogs, too.\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux can jump into action at a moment's notice, and are surprisingly speedy for their size, but they are happiest lounging around with their family. They thrive on interacting with the people they love the most, though their snoring and constant drooling certainly won't win them any awards in the Quietest Sleeper or Tidiest Dog categories.",
  "care_description": "These dogs may be high on the maintenance scale, but caring for a Dogue de Bordeaux is not all work and no play. While their wrinkly faces, complete with buckets of drool, require daily cleaning, their fur is fairly easy to maintain and requires minimal brushing. As a puppy, the breed needs proper socialization and training to grow up friendly and confident. But when it comes to exercise, you're in luck—they're not really into running and have much lower energy levels than, say, a Border Collie. So that leaves more time for playing and lounging (again, you're really going to need that king-sized bed!).",
  "grooming_description": "A Dogue de Bordeaux's wrinkly face is among their cutest traits. Those wonderfully mushy faces, though, do require daily cleaning to keep their wrinkles clean and dry.\n\nDogue de Bordeaux shed minimally year-round, but a weekly brushing with rubber curry or shedding blade is typically enough to keep loose hair from creating an unwanted layer over your furniture. A bath once a month is all they need to stay fresh. Trim your Dogue de Bordeaux's nails every two to four weeks or before they start to click on the floor when they walk. Check their ears regularly for debris, redness or swelling; if you notice any of the above, contact your vet, who may recommend at-home ear cleaning.\n\nBrush your dog's teeth daily. Starting when your Dogue de Bordeaux is a puppy will get them used to it faster. An annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not groomer) will keep their teeth and gums in tip-top condition. Dental disease can lead to a host of other health issues, including organ damage, so proper dental care is a must.",
  "training_description": "Dogues de Bordeaux are loyal companions who were used as guard dogs on French estates in the during the late 18th century. As a result, they can be wary of strangers, making early socialization and training essential to ensure your Dogue de Bordeaux puppy grows up friendly and confident.\n\nThough they are a large, intelligent and powerful breed, and their bite force (ie, how hard they can bite) is one of the strongest among dogs, these pups have a sensitive soul that doesn't respond well to harsh or forceful words when training. This French Mastiff breed requires the relationship-building and trust that develops with positive reinforcement training methods, which involves using treats, praise and playtime with special toys to reward them for a good job. They can be strong-willed, and pet parents must be willing to commit to consistent training starting in puppyhood to teach their dog basic skills and manners.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Dogue de Bordeaux typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). When in doubt, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the best food for your dog based on their individual needs.\n\nIt's important to note that this dog is not a high-energy pup. As such, it may be all too easy for them to pack on the pounds, and you'll want make sure you don't overfeed them. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet. But it's not just mealtime you need to consider—remember that treats are calories, too! You'll be giving your pup lots of treats as rewards (and just because you love them). So, be sure you stick with smaller-sized dog training treats and only occasional snack times to avoid extra weight gain. Avoid table scraps, especially cooked bones and high-fat foods.",
  "exercise_description": "If you'd prefer to read about running rather than actually run, then you have found your perfect match with the Dogue de Bordeaux. As a large breed, it's easy to stress the Dogue de Bordeaux's bones, joints and ligaments, so intense exercise, like running up and down stairs or jumping off anything taller than their shoulder, should be limited until they are at least 18 months old.\n\nThey still have typical puppy behaviors, though, so mental stimulation is important. Pet parents may want to try an interactive dog bowl for meals and/or puzzle toys or games for enrichment.\n\nAs they get older, walking these pups 30 to 45 minutes once a day is sufficient exercise. As full-grown adults, the breed can handle more activity, but will never be runners (neither will you, and you're OK with that). Many Dogues de Bordeaux love swimming, and hopping in the water with them is the perfect no-impact activity and a great way to keep them cool on hotter days.",
  "ideal_environment": "While the Dogue de Bordeaux doesn't need a ton of exercise, they are big dogs who need their space, so apartment living isn't ideal for this breed. Because of their size and the pressure that puts on their bones and joints, a Dogue de Bordeaux's ideal home is a one-story house with few steps. If you live in a spacious condo on an upper level, make sure you have an elevator available.\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux can be good with families with older children, other pets, and cats if socialized properly and/or if they grow up together. They are incredibly loyal and want to be with their people at all times, but pet parents need to properly socialize their Dogue de Bordeaux with strangers so they don't become overwhelmed by company.",
  "health_description": "The Dogue de Bordeaux has a lifespan of 5 to 8 years, and there are several health issues seen commonly in this breed. Knowing about these potential concerns will help you to proactively ensure your pup lives a happy, long life.\n\n\t• Bloat: Also known as gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), bloat is a major emergency concern in larger breeds with deep chests. It occurs when a dog’s stomach fills with gas, food or fluid. When the stomach becomes distended, it puts pressure on the organs and decreases blood flow. In many cases, the stomach twists and obstructs blood supply to major organs. This can happen quickly and be life-threatening and requires surgery.\nOrthopedic Issues: The size of the Dogue de Bordeaux can put strain on bones, joints and ligaments, resulting in dysplasia in the hips, elbows and shoulders. Dysplasia occurs when the joint isn’t formed correctly and can be painful. Joint dysplasia can generally be treated with medication, such as joint supplements and anti-inflammatories, and sometimes surgery.\nHeart Disease: Dogues de Bordeaux are especially susceptible to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which occurs when the heart becomes enlarged and weak and can no longer pump blood effectively. This condition can usually be managed with medication. Another heart concern is aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of one of the valves of the heart. Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed.\nLymphoma: Lymphoma, or lymphosarcoma, occurs more often in the Dogue de Bordeaux than other breeds. The disease causes the body to make abnormal lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, which means it can be found anywhere in the body. It’s one of the few cancers that can be found through a blood test. Like in humans, the treatment is typically chemotherapy.\nEpilepsy: Seizure disorders in the Dogue de Bordeaux are typically genetic and occur between 6 months and 5 years of age. Though scary for a pet parent to watch, seizures can usually be managed with medication.\nHereditary Footpad Hyperkeratosis: This occurs when the skin on the footpads develops abnormally, resulting in hardening that leads to splits and cracks. Signs typically develop in Dogues at 4-6 months of age. There is no cure, but there are medications and techniques to help manage the condition.",
  "history_description": "Like several dog breeds, including the Berger de Beauce, the Dogue de Bordeaux originates from France, in the Bordeaux region. Also called French Mastiffs, their history goes back to ancient times, and the accepted theory is that they were introduced to France (known as Gaul at the time) in the first century BC. The dogs were used as war dogs and ruthless warriors. Throughout time, the breed has been used as hunters and drafters pulling wagons and carts.\n\nDogues de Bordeaux were originally bred in two types, the smaller Doguin who disappeared in the 1700s and the larger dog which is what we now know as the Dogue de Bordeaux. Around that same time, they were used as guard dogs for estates of aristocrats, but that ended during the French Revolution when nobility were sent to prison or killed.\n\nThe breed became popular in the United States with the release of the 1989 movie \"Turner & Hooch.\" The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2007, and the Dogue de Bordeaux joined the AKC Working group in 2008. (The Working group includes the dogs who typically have jobs to do, like guarding or pulling sleds.)\n\nAre you looking to add a Dogue de Bordeaux puppy to your family? This type of puppy typically costs between $1,500-$2,500. Check out the AKC puppy finder to find a reputable breeder who should screen for health and temperament issues. You can also seek out local Dogue de Bordeaux rescues to find a worthy, loving dog to adopt, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area. When adopting, be sure to ask for the dog's wellness check information.",
