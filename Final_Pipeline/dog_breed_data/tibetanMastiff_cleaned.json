  "breed_intro": "We’re not saying that if you ran into a Tibetan Mastiff in the woods that you’d definitely mistake them for a four-legged Sasquatch, but it’s possible. At their largest, they can be 150 pounds or more, and they have floofy, shaggy mane that would make a lion jealous.  \n\nBut they also have a loyalty that’s as heartwarming as they are massive. If you give them lots of outdoor space and mentally stimulating tasks, they’ll be a true-blue friend.",
  "appearance_description": "A Tibetan Mastiff’s fluffy fur gives them a bearlike appearance, and their thick mane lends a lion-esque air to their noble nature. Their expressive eyes are wise and alert. Hovering around 28 inches tall, even the Tibetan Mastiff’s height is impressive.",
  "temperament_description": "Tibetan Mastiffs are introverts. They’re exceptionally loyal and adoring of their person (or family), but they tend to be wary of (or just completely ignore) strangers. They’ll probably think of you as their equal instead of as their pet parent, but they’re so smart and independent, they’re not exactly wrong.  \n\nLike all dogs, Tibetan Mastiffs require proper socialization from the time they’re a puppy (or as early as possible, if you adopt them when they’re older). With safe and supervised exposure to different people, pets, and situations, they’ll be more adaptable. \n\nTibetan Mastiff puppies can be taught to get along well with children and other pets when raised with them. But as adults, they may be less accepting of new dogs or other people’s children, even with socialization.  \n\nBecause their sheer size, it’s a good idea to supervise all Tibetans around young children, cats, or small dogs. Teach all children how to interact gently and respectfully with dogs. \n\nThese dogs typically won’t love agility trials or anything else where speed comes into play. They’re happiest when they have their own little world to look after—give them a yard with room to roam and their own little paradise to “supervise,” and they’ll be thrilled.",
  "care_description": "Despite all their fur, the Tibetan Mastiff is not as high-maintenance as you might think. They don’t need a lot of grooming or exercise, but they do need work to keep them well-socialized and good-mannered.",
  "grooming_description": "The Tibetan Mastiff is a no-fuss pup.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: Their coats are good at repelling dirt, so they don’t need a bath more than once a month.  \nBrushing: Every spring, Tibetan Mastiffs blow their undercoats (where they shed chunks of hair, instead of individual strands) and will need to be worked over with an undercoat rake. The rest of the year, weekly brushing with a pin brush or slicker brush is enough to keep their moderate shedding under control and keep their fur from matting.  \nDental care: Brush your Tibetan Mastiff’s teeth daily. Start when they’re a puppy, if possible, so they get used to the routine. Regular brushing, combined with dental treats, water additives, and other dental health tools, can help prevent tooth and gum disease. See your vet once a year for a pro teeth cleaning. \nEar care: Once a month, check for debris in the ear canal, and examine the ears for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or any bad smell. Call your vet if you notice anything.\r\n\n\t• Your vet may recommend at-home ear cleaning. You can wipe the inside and outside of the ears with a damp cloth or ear wipes, taking care to avoid the ear canal.\r\n\nNail care: Nails need trimming once or twice a month. You’ll know it’s time for a trim when you hear them tapping on hard surfaces as your dog walks by.",
  "training_description": "The Tibetan Mastiff is one smart cookie, but they also think very independently and tend to follow their own instincts when it comes to training, so you’ll have to earn their trust.  \n\nThis pup needs a leader who’s patient and consistent; use positive reinforcement training to reward your dog with toys, treats, and praise for good behavior. You may need to experiment to find a reward that will get them excited enough to pay attention to you. (As much as they love you, they have their own minds and opinions about the world.) \n\nSocialize your Tibetan Mastiff puppy from the time you bring them home (or as early as possible if you adopt), safely exposing them to as many new people, children, animals, and environments as you can. You’ll want to continue socializing their whole life to keep them engaged with the world, as these loyal souls tend to be naturally introverted.  \n\nTibetan Mastiffs do best with experienced pet parents who can instill these dogs with good manners. Enlisting the help of a certified dog trainer may be a good idea, too.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Tibetan Mastiff typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food that’s complete and balanced. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Pick a large-breed formula, which supports the bones and joints of dogs the Tibetan Mastiff’s size.  \n\nBecause Tibetan Mastiffs can develop a life-threatening health issue called GDV (more on that later), take these precautions during mealtimes:  \r\n\n\t• Feed your dog multiple daily meals—not one big daily meal. \nDon’t let your dog exercise for an hour before or after eating. \nOffer your Tibetan Mastiff food in slow feeder bowls, snuffle mats, or puzzle toys. This slows down how quickly they scarf.  \nAvoid using raised food bowls, which may increase the risk of GDV.  \r\n\nSupplements or treats containing glucosamine, chondroitin, and fish oils can also help protect your dog’s joint health as they age. Ask your veterinarian if your Tibetan Mastiff would benefit from these supplements. Your vet can also help you determine the best food and diet, including serving size and feeding schedule, based on your dog’s age, weight, and activity level.  \n\nAs with any dog, make sure your Tibetan Mastiff doesn’t gain extra weight, as obesity can have a negative effect on their body and joints. Only give a moderate amount of extra goodies; treats shouldn’t make up more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "Tibetan Mastiffs have a moderate energy level and need 20–30 minutes of daily exercise. Ideally, they’ll get this out in the yard, sniffing around the area in the morning and early evening, when they’re most active. \n\nIf you don’t have a lot of land, you’ll need to take them on walks during these times of day. Allow them to rest in the middle of the day, especially during the warmer months, where overheating is a serious risk. \n\nThese strong-minded pups won’t always come when you call and (given their introverted personalities) they might not be a natural bestie for other canines, so taking them to a dog park or allowing them to go off-leash aren’t good ideas.  \n\nThese unique pups also might not be into structured games as much as other dogs. Don’t be surprised if they’re not fascinated by fetch—they’re already busy surveying the land.",
  "ideal_environment": "The ideal home for a Tibetan Mastiff has lots of acres to wander. At minimum, they need a large fenced yard. They do great in colder climates and higher altitudes and may be less active in warmer climates, especially during the hottest parts of the day. \n\nTibetan Mastiffs aren’t a great fit for first-time pet parents. In fact, these dogs need an experienced person who has the time and energy for daily obedience training and socialization—both are consistently necessary to help your pup live their best life. \n\nWith proper socialization, Tibetan Mastiffs can get along well with kids and other pets, especially if they’re raised with them. But due to their sheer size and strength, they should always be supervised when meeting and playing with others.  \n\nNote that these reserved souls appreciate a calm environment. Children who are loud and rambunctious may startle your dog and won’t be the best companions. Tibetan Mastiffs are also generally not a great fit for homes with cats or tiny dogs.  \n\nA properly socialized Tibetan Mastiff will tolerate the presence of people and dogs whom they don’t know well, but they tend to be aloof toward (and sometimes wary of) strangers. That just means more time to enjoy with their favorite person—you.",
  "health_description": "The typical Tibetan Mastiff lifespan is 10–12 years, and they don’t tend to have a lot of health issues. Here are some that may pop up:  \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Tibetan Mastiffs, like many large breeds, are prone to a life-threatening condition called bloat  that occurs when the stomach becomes distended with air and/or food. Sometimes, the stomach twists and cuts off blood to organs in the abdomen—this is called gastric dilatation-volvulus. Go to the emergency vet immediately if you notice signs of bloat or GDV: a distended abdomen, dry heaving, pacing and restlessness, and excessive drooling. \nEye issues: Tibetan Mastiffs are prone to both entropion, in which the eyelid folds inward, and ectropion, which causes the lower lid to fold outward. These conditions don’t usually affect vision, but they can cause irritation, discomfort, and (in severe cases) cornea damage.  \nHip and elbow dysplasia: Common in large breeds, dysplasia is where the joints don’t fit together properly, whether it’s the hip or elbow. Treatment may include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, physical therapy, or surgery. \nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms include weight gain, lethargy, and chronic ear and skin infections. Low thyroid is typically easily managed with daily lifelong medication.",
  "history_description": "Tibetan Mastiffs are an ancient breed from the mountains of Central Asia. But despite their ancient origins (records of large guardian dogs date back to 1100 B.C.E. China), very little is known about their history, according to the American Tibetan Mastiff Association.  \n\nWhat is known is that in 1800, an English ship captain’s travel memoirs mentioned “huge” guardian dogs at the monasteries in Tibet. The first such dog was brought to England in 1847 and presented to Queen Victoria as a gift. A few decades later, in 1873, the breed officially entered England’s new Kennel Club as the Tibetan Mastiff.  \n\nThe following year, the Prince of Wales brought two more of them to England, where they were eventually a part of the Alexandra Palace Show. \n\nThe American Kennel Club didn’t recognize this breed until 2007. But nowadays, you’d be much likelier to find one of these pups in the U.S. than you would in Tibet. \n\nTibetan Mastiffs cost anywhere from $2,500 to $3,500. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Tibetan Mastiff adoption. Look into a organizations like Tibetan Mastiff Rescue, keep an eye out at your local shelter or rescue, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
