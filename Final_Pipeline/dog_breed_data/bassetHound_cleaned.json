  "breed_intro": "Looking for a mellow dog who can’t help but give off a “woe is me” vibe with their droopy ears and big, soulful eyes? You may be the perfect pet parent for a Basset Hound. \n\nBasset Hounds aren’t going to run any races or join you on mountain-climbing hikes (and they shouldn’t, to protect their fragile back), but they will be a constant companion who loves to stop and smell the flowers (literally). And if they get a whiff of a scent they just can’t resist from across the way, their sudden enthusiasm might just surprise you.",
  "appearance_description": "Basset Hounds have soulful puppy dog eyes, short legs, and powerful snoots held low to the ground. Their ears are an adorable tripping hazard. Most commonly, their coat is a combo of black, tan, and white.",
  "temperament_description": "Basset Hounds are happy daydreamers with a laidback aura. They’re good-natured and calm dogs with a personality that’s accepting of family and guests equally. Don’t expect them to get all wiggly and excited about things like most dogs—Basset Hounds are a bit more reserved than that.  \n\nBut they will surprise everyone when they’re captivated by a scent they must sniff. They’ll cheerfully run off after whatever smell they detect, so it’s smart to keep them on a leash when they’re not in a fenced area.   \n\nBecause they can come off a little lackadaisical, it’s easy to dismiss Bassets as not as bright as other pups—but this would be a mistake. These dogs are very intellectual, and they need something to do with their nose and mind.  \n\nScent work keeps them happy, so they require a pet parent who can help with tracking and making sure they’re mentally stimulated with access to lots of sniffs and smells.    \n\nIf it takes your Basset Hound a bit longer to pick up on training, it’s probably just because they were preoccupied by all the scents around them. They’re not people pleasers, either, so they need a pet parent who makes training fun.  \n\nThese medium-sized pups are also affectionate souls. They don’t know they’re not exactly small enough to be lapdogs, so be prepared for some oversized snuggles on the couch.",
  "care_description": "Basset Hound have big ears and loose skin that need extra attention. They’re fairly easy to care for, but they need the usual training and socialization to be their best selves.",
  "grooming_description": "These delightful pups don’t need a lot of time in front of a mirror—but they could still use a hand keeping their coat shiny and their ears dry and clean.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: Basset Hounds have smooth, short hair that does a great job of repelling dirt and water. Bathe them once a month (unless they happen to splash in a particularly muddy puddle).   \nBrushing: Use a bristle brush once a week to keep their coat shiny and shedding under control.  \nDental care: Teeth should be brushed daily with a dog toothpaste. You can ask your vet if they recommend dental chews as well.   \nEar care: Ear care is essential for this breed because their floppy ears can trap moisture. Check frequently for debris, redness, odor, and swelling, and ask your vet if they recommend at-home ear cleaning.   \nNail care: Nails should be trimmed every three to four weeks—you’ll know it’s time when you hear them clacking on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Start your Basset Hound puppy with some basic obedience training, like sit, stay, and come, when they’re as young as 8 weeks old. If you adopt a Basset Hound when they’re an adult, start training as soon as you can—it’s never too late for them to learn.  \n\nDon’t forget to socialize your puppy, too—you can ask your vet when it’s safe to begin. It’s important to introduce your dog to new people and places so they’re used to novel interactions and continue to be a chill and relaxed pup. \n\nBasset Hounds are very smart dogs. So if it takes them a while to get the hang of things, it’s not for lack of intelligence, but more so because they can be a bit independent-minded.  \n\nAs scent hounds, Bassets can be easily distracted by interesting smells. You can’t really blame them when their sniffers are second only to the famous detective, the Bloodhound. So, keep training sessions short, and be consistent and patient for best results.  \n\nAlways use positive reinforcement—praise, special treats, and toys—to teach your pup how to be on their very best behavior.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Choose a complete and balanced diet that’s AAFCO-approved for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.  \n\nBasset Hounds love to eat, and their propensity for delicious kibble (combined with their low-exercise needs) can cause them to gain unnecessary weight. They also have a sensitive back, so it’s important to keep their weight in check to avoid issues there. Work with your vet to determine the best diet for your Basset Hound.  \n\nAs they get older, a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement as well as omega-3 fatty acids could be great additions to their diet to help with back and joint problems. Your vet can tell you if supplements a smart idea.",
  "exercise_description": "Basset Hounds aren’t athletes—even if they tried to jog, those droopy ears would probably get in the way. Plus, their long back and short legs aren’t designed for running, so stick to walks.  \n\nThey won’t enjoy adventures like hiking, either, so stay closer to home. Around 20–30 minutes of exercise each day is plenty for these mellow pups.   \n\nBut intellectual exercise is a whole other story. As smart, independent thinkers, Basset Hounds do best with an outlet for their powerful tracking instincts—you can look for local tracking classes or track with your dog on your own.  \n\nOf course, scent work is a must. Basset Hounds will enjoy sniffing out treats that you’ve hidden around the house, and a snuffle mat mimics foraging for food in the grass (though you can hide goodies in the yard, too).",
  "ideal_environment": "As a good choice for a first-time pet parent, your Basset Hound will likely be happy to call anywhere home. But there are a few caveats: They do best in a home without a lot of stairs, and they’re probably not your soul pup if you’re a star athlete. \n\nThese easygoing canines also enjoy a good bay (that’s a long, profound howl) that your neighbors might have strong feelings about. So, if you live in an apartment or just have sensitive neighbors, you’ll likely need a home that offers a little more space for your Basset Hound to be themself.    \n\nWhen well-socialized, these hounds can be delightful with children and babies, and chances are they’ll even enjoy the company of cats. They might not run to the door to greet your company, but they certainly won’t mind if you host dinner parties now and then.  \n\nBasset Hounds don’t enjoy being left alone for too long, so it’s ideal if you’re not away for most of the day. They may also do well with a dog buddy to keep them company when you’re not home.",
  "health_description": "The typical Basset Hound lifespan is 12–13 years. Here are some health issues to be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Ear infections: Basset Hounds are predisposed to ear infections. Prevention involves keeping their ears clean and dry, especially after a bath; ask your vet how often you need to clean your Basset’s ears and which ear-cleaning product to use. Treatment often includes topical antibiotics, antifungal compounds, and anti-inflammatory meds.  \nElbow and hip dysplasia: Elbow and hip dysplasia are genetic conditions that develop during puppyhood when the joints don’t align well and become looser than normal. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or (in severe cases) surgery. \nGlaucoma: Glaucoma occurs when fluid in the eyes doesn’t drain and pressure builds. This medical emergency can be painful and result in blindness. Glaucoma can be genetic in Basset Hounds, and there is a screening test. Treatment is topical medications or surgery.   \nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP): ITP is a blood disease where the dog’s immune system attacks the body’s platelets. This affects clotting and can result in internal or spontaneous bleeding, making ITP a medical emergency. Treatment may include a blood transfusion or immunosuppressive medications.  \nIntervertebral disc disease (IVDD): IVDD is a neurological condition caused by a bulging or slipped disc pushing on the spinal cord. It can be very painful, and your dog may be suddenly paralyzed or unable to use their back (or, less often, front) legs.\r\n\n\t• Keeping your Basset Hound at a healthy weight helps prevent IVDD, but you also need to make sure their bottom and back are always supported when you pick them up. They also need to avoid stairs as much as possible.  \r\n\nVon Willebrand disease: Basset Hounds are susceptible to von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder where the blood doesn’t clot properly. Your veterinarian can test your dog for this.",
  "history_description": "The Basset Hound was the 10th breed to be recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885.  \n\nOriginally bred in France and Belgium, the Basset Hound—from the French word bas, meaning low—is a low-to-the-ground cousin of the Bloodhound. They originally became popular because of their ability to sniff out hares in the wild.  \n\nThe breed’s popularity skyrocketed in the U.S. in 1928 when TIME magazine featured a Bassett Hound on the cover in celebration of the 52nd annual Westminster Dog Show. The Basset Hound Club of America formed in 1935.  \n\nThese smart pups enjoyed another popularity boost in the 1960s when they were featured in an ad campaign for Hush Puppy shoes and in the Fred Basset comic strip.\n\nBasset Hound puppies can be anywhere from $850–$2,500 or more. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Basset Hound adoption, as there are many pups patiently waiting for their forever homes. Adopt through a Basset Hound rescue, like the Tri-State Basset Hound Rescue or ABC Basset Rescue; keep an eye out at your local animal shelter or pet rescue; or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
