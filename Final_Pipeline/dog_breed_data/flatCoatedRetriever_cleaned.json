  "appearance_description": "Flat-Coated Retrievers have sleek bodies that are highly athletic and powerful. Their intelligent, animated expressions let you know they're always ready for new adventures and games. This breed's lustrous, flat, straight coat helps protect them from water and weather while they're out for a hunt or hike. The Flat-Coated Retriever's wagging tail often gets a workout when this breed meets new people or plays a game of fetch with their favorite humans.",
  "temperament_description": "If you were to take the head of your high school's pep squad and magically transform them into a dog, paws down you'd get a Flat-Coated Retriever. Known for being friendly and outgoing, their happy-go-lucky temperament will rub off on you whether you're going for a walk, playing a game of fetch or heading off on another adventure with your new best friend. Three cheers for that!\n\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever breed is very family-oriented, highly social and not known to be aggressive. But while the Flat-Coated Retriever doesn't rank high on biting tendencies, these dogs can act like puppies even into adulthood, so some mouthing and playful biting might occur.\n\nThey are the epitome of the social butterfly and love meeting new people. (They're always looking for new recruits to the Homecoming committee!) Their family comes first, though—they bond strongly to their people and get along well with kids, dogs and cats.\n\nThis high-energy breed is happiest outside where they can run and romp. Bred to be sporting dogs, the Flat-Coated Retriever will be happy to retrieve game for you, but the breed is also well-suited for sports like agility, tracking and scentwork.",
  "care_description": "Despite their rugged appearance, a Flat-Coated Retriever is a high-maintenance pooch. While their coats are relatively easy to maintain, they do shed a lot, and since they're extremely active and mature more slowly than other dog breeds, you'll be spending a lot of your time playing with and training your pup.",
  "grooming_description": "The Flat-Coated Retriever's grooming needs are about average, compared to other dog breeds like the Golden Retriever, but be prepared: They do shed more than other shorter-haired dogs. Here are some grooming tips for your Flat-Coated Retriever:\n\n \t• Brushing: The Flat-Coated Retriever breed has a longer flat coat, and they need to be brushed once a week at a minimum. First, brush your pup's coat with a slicker brush to remove the loose hairs and remove the tangles. Then, follow with a metal comb to ensure you got all the tangles out. Frequent grooming can help to minimize the number of times you'll need to pull out the vacuum; but even with regular grooming, you'll still want to keep a few lint rollers handy to deal with that heavy shedding.\nEar cleaning: While your brushing your pup, check their ears for debris or wax build-up. If you notice signs of infection (redness, swelling or foul odor), contact your vet. If they recommend at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nBathing: Plan to give your dog a bath every three to four weeks at a minimum. If your pup has been swimming or especially active, you may need to give them a bath more frequently.\nDental care: It's also important to give your Flat-Coated Retriever the dental care they need. Vets recommend brushing your dog's teeth daily. This helps prevent dental tartar buildup and keeps your Flat-Coated Retriever's teeth healthy. Start by introducing teeth brushing when your dog is a puppy. Your vet can give you some tips on how to best brush your dog's teeth. It's recommended that your dog have a full dental cleaning at the vet once each year to get those pearly whites completely clean.\nNail trimming: Flat-Coated Retrievers will also need regular nail trims about once a month to keep their nails at an appropriate length. Keeping your dog's nails shorter prevents them from straining and causing pain to their paws.",
  "training_description": "Flat-Coated Retriever dogs are friendly and enthusiastic, and they can grow to be quite large. Starting with positive reinforcement training (aka rewarding good behavior with treats, toys or praise) and focusing on leash manners and how to politely greet people when your dog is a puppy will be helpful as your dog grows. Flat-Coated Retrievers also tend to mature slowly, which means some puppy-like behaviors may carry on well into their adulthood. Training can help them learn what's acceptable and what's, well, not.\n\nWith the Flat-Coated Retriever's high level of intelligence and their history of being bred to work with their humans, you've got a dog who needs plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. Training can help with this, and enrichment and exercise like food puzzles and nosework games can keep your dog engaged and entertained.\n\nThis breed tends to be highly sensitive, so it's even more important to make sure to use positive reinforcement training. Punishing a behavior can be scary and painful for a dog, and if a dog doesn't take corrections well, this type of training can break the dog's confidence and result in lifelong, fear-based behavior problems. Instead, work with a trainer who specializes in positive reinforcement and who can set your dog up for success.\n\nBe sure to start socializing your Flat-Coated Retriever (aka introducing them to new people and experiences) while they're a puppy to help reinforce their naturally friendly nature. Take them on walks and let them meet new people and other dogs. Puppy school is a great way to start socializing your pup. They'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\n\nFlat-Coated Retrievers are people-lovers at their core, but they can sometimes express that love in undesirable ways. For example, they have a tendency to jump on people when greeting them, which is well-intentioned but not ideal, given their larger size and height. Training can help curb their enthusiasm and teach them to greet new friends in a more socially acceptable way—perhaps a paw-shake and a vigorous tail-wag?",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Flat-Coated Retriever typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or a senior.\n\nHighly active dogs, like many Flat-Coated Retrievers, will benefit from a high-protein diet. If your dog loves to run and play, they may need this higher protein content. Dogs who are quieter and don't participate lots of athletic activity won't need this extra protein, and they could gain unnecessary weight on a high-protein diet. Consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right high-quality dog food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "To keep them happy and healthy, Flat-Coated Retrievers need at least 90 minutes of exercise a day. A fenced-in yard can give your dog plenty of running room, but they'll also benefit from plenty of time hiking, swimming and exploring with you. All those trail maps you've been hoarding? Time to put them to good use.\r\n\r\nBecause this breed has a high energy level, getting them started in dog sports can give them another way to burn off energy. (As an added bonus, it's a great way for your Flat-Coated Retriever to spend time with their favorite person—you!) This breed's speed makes them well-suited for sports like dock diving and agility. Their sensitive noses are perfect for scentwork and tracking. Your dog might also love obedience and rally sports—anything that keeps their paws and nose active!",
  "ideal_environment": "Their high energy and larger size means that Flat-Coated Retrievers do best in larger homes or even a farm, where there is space to run and roam with an active pet parent. They can fit into smaller homes and apartments as long as there is a fenced-in yard or other outlet that provides them plenty of exercise.\r\n\r\nThanks to their friendly and eager-to-please nature, the Flat-Coated Retriever tends to form strong bonds with their pet parents and loves to be surrounded by family. They get along great with kids, other dogs and, yes, even cats (when properly trained and socialized). Still, it's still important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nThis breed loves people, and most Flat-Coated Retrievers will happily meet your guests at the door with an enthusiastic tail wag. Just remember this breed can go a little overboard in their exuberant greetings by jumping on guests, so social households that enjoy throwing parties will want to make sure they can keep their Flat-Coated Retriever's greetings in check.\r\n\r\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever puppy is slow to mature, and their puppy-like behaviors may continue for years. For that reason, this breed is best-suited for experienced pet parents with a sense of humor. These dogs tend to be good-natured but a bit mischievous—your favorite pair of shoes may quickly become chew toys, and your energetic dog will try to turn anything into a game of fetch—so it's important that a family can think ahead, puppy-proof a house (even for an adult dog) and laugh off the dog's antics.",
  "health_description": "Flat-Coated Retrievers have a life expectancy of 8-10 years. While this breed tends to be healthy, there are some health issues you should be aware of. Knowing about these issues can help you to avoid or quickly recognize them, keeping your dog healthy and happy. \r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a painful condition where the ball and socket of your dog’s hip joint rub together. This can get worse as your dog ages and can make it difficult for them to run and play. Hip dysplasia can be hereditary, so it’s a good idea to work with a breeder who has evaluated their breeding dogs for the condition. If your dog does develop hip dysplasia, there are many treatment options, including pain medications and surgery. \r\n \t• Luxating Patellas: Luxating patella is a condition in which your dog’s kneecap slips in and out of place. This can be painful, and your dog may limp on and off as the kneecap shifts, then returns to its correct position. In severe cases, surgery may be recommended to correct this issue. \r\n \t• Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Also called bloat, GDV is a condition that can occur where your dog’s stomach twists and gets filled with gas. This is a life-threatening emergency that typically requires surgery. GDV often affects dogs who have deep and narrow chests, so the Flat-Coated Retriever can be at risk. Your vet may recommend tacking your dog’s stomach to their body wall during their spay or neuter as a preventative measure (called prophylactic gastropexy). You can also help prevent bloat by feeding your dog more frequent meals throughout the day using a slow feeding bowl. \r\n \t• Cataracts: Flat-Coated Retrievers can be prone to developing cataracts, which are a white or milky opacity that can limit your dog’s vision. If they progress, some cataracts can cause blindness. Cataracts can be hereditary, and they can typically be surgically removed. \r\n \t• Glaucoma: Glaucoma can be a genetic condition affecting flat-coated retrievers resulting in increased ocular pressure that can cause pain and blindness. There is a genetic screening test so be sure to ask your breeder.  Diagnosis is typically by checking intraocular pressure (IOP), and treatment is most commonly eye drops and medication.",
  "history_description": "The Flat-Coated Retriever's origins began in Britain in the 1800s. The breed was heavily influenced by the St. John's Dog and Setter. The Flat-Coated Retriever's coat was one of their most notable characteristics, and it was developed to help protect the dog from rain, brush and other elements they would face when out hunting.\r\n\r\nFlat-Coated Retrievers were bred to be easily trainable and to be physically suited to the hunt field. They accompanied hunters while duck hunting, swimming out to fetch the ducks that had been shot.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were initially highly popular. They did well in dog shows and field trials. Initially, the black-coated dogs were valued more highly, but the liver-colored dogs became more popular in the 1900s. However, the Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever were also recognized as separate breeds, and these breeds gradually surpassed the Flat-Coated Retriever in popularity. The American Kennel Club (AKC) officially recognized the Flat-Coated Retriever in 1915.\r\n\r\nWhile Flat-Coated Retrievers had been highly popular with gamekeepers and hunters, World War II resulted in challenges like food shortages and limited transportation, causing the breed's numbers to decline. After the World Wars, breeders turned their attention to preserving the breed and their history, which they did successfully. Since then, selective breeding has helped to restore this unique breed, and today, the Flat-Coated Retriever is popular as both a hunting and family dog.\r\n\r\nYou can find Flat-Coated Retriever puppies from reputable breeders on the AKC's website. The average Flat-Coated Retriever puppy price varies from $2,000-$3,000. For that price, you're usually getting a puppy who has been screened for potential health problems and temperament issues, and your puppy might have pedigree papers. You can also reach out to local shelters to see if there is a Flat-Coated Retriever to adopt.",
