  "breed_intro": "If your perfect Saturday involves breakfast in bed and lounging in your pajamas, the Belgian Malinois will probably have some questions. For starters, “Why are you still lying there?” and “How soon can we go outdoors?”  \n\nTheir ideal pet parent starts the day with a 5-mile run, spends the afternoon out to the hiking trail, and doesn’t come home until the sun goes down. Of course, they’ll want to be right next to you for all of this, as these dogs are bursting with energy—and devotion.  \n\nBelgian Malinois need a pet parent who’s in excellent shape, can handle their intense activity level, and (just like them) loves a good outdoor challenge.",
  "appearance_description": "The Belgian Malinois’ alert gaze and powerful build show they’re ready for action whenever you are.  \n\nMals sport thick, short coats in fawn or mahogany with black at the tips. With a swift, sure gait and their heads held high, a Belgian Malinois is proud to protect and serve—and play all day.",
  "temperament_description": "The Belgian Malinois’ temperament is as spirited as they come, making them a good fit for pet parents who love to be on the go. Ready to toil tirelessly at any task, a Mal is quick to respond to their person’s cues and is considered one of the smartest dog breeds in the world. \n\nTheir intelligence paired with their admirable strength is reason to salute them: They often work in search-and-rescue missions alongside the police and military.  \n\nIt’s possible to bring a Belgian Malinois into a home with kids and babies, but compatibility rests heavily on early and consistent training and socialization. Children, too, must be taught how to interact with dogs. Even then, you’ll want to make sure playtime is supervised, as other animals, strangers, and sudden movements could startle this alert pup.  \n\nThe Belgian Malinois has a naturally high prey drive, which means they’ll chase moving objects (think toddlers, cars, cats, and other dogs), so early obedience lessons are a must to keep everyone (including them!) safe and happy. \n\nRaising Belgian Malinois puppies is indeed rewarding, in part because their smarts make them a joy to teach. If you choose to adopt a Mal, you’ll quickly see why their reliability and razor-sharp wits are universally adored.",
  "care_description": "Belgian Malinois don’t have extensive grooming needs, as their relatively short coat is easy to manage. The time you save on hair care will be spent outside, whether in your backyard, at the park, or on a hiking trail. Exercise is no afterthought with this active breed, so lace up your sneakers.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Don’t bathe your Mal too often unless they’re visibly dirty (every couple of months is fine).  \nBrushing: A Belgian Malinois has a short coat and doesn’t require lots of trips to the beauty shop. Instead, weekly brushing sessions keep their coat healthy and distribute skin oils, giving the coat a subtle sheen. Pet parents have their pick of tools, including a bristle brush or nifty rubber mitts. Heavy shedding happens twice a year (in the spring and fall), so during these extra floofy times, your pup will need daily brushing.  \nDental care: Daily teeth brushing fights plaque buildup on your dog’s teeth and also prevents periodontal disease. Once a year, get a professional cleaning. \nNail care: Nail clipping is needed every three weeks or so (you can also ask a groomer for help).",
  "training_description": "Whether you sign up for dog obedience classes or take a DIY approach, training your Belgian Malinois will harness this pup’s bright mind and teach them good manners.  \n\nUse positive reinforcement to train your pup; these dogs are surprisingly sensitive, so it’s important to let them know they’ve done a job well done. Praise, treats, and special toys are all fun rewards. \n\nBecause Mals are a herding breed, their instinct is to chase and corral anything that moves, whether around the house or out in public. With proper training, you can curb your dog’s determined (though unfortunately misguided) tendency to dash after moving objects. \n\nEarly socialization is also part of the game, and it’ll help your Malinois get used to new people and situations. Teach them how to walk on a leash and how to perform cues like come and sit, while always keeping tabs on other people nearby.  \n\nChildren tend to see a Belgian Malinois as a big pony because of their size, so they’ll need to learn how to behave around them and be respectful of their food, toys, and space.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Food should be high quality, complete, and balanced. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s stage of life (puppy, adult, or senior). \n\nMals are prone to weight gain, so watch it with the food scoop. You should count your dog’s calories to keep track and prevent obesity. If you notice your pup has put on a few pounds, talk with your vet about a nutrition and exercise plan designed to shed the extra weight. \n\nTreats, of course, are perfectly acceptable, especially when you’re in training mode (and that adorable puppy face definitely deserves some jerky). But don’t dole out too much of a good thing—treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calorie intake.",
  "exercise_description": "If your idea of a perfect workout involves hiking for several miles or a long run on the beach, a Belgian Malinois is your soul pup. This dog’s energy level might seem boundless, and a slow stroll on a leash once a day is not enough exercise to keep them happy.  \n\nMal pet parents should give their dogs at least two 30-minute sessions of rigorous exercise per day. Mals who don’t get enough exercise will find other ways to entertain themselves, so for the sake of your shoes (and your pup’s happiness!), keep them busy.  \n\nWalking on a leash is nice for taking in the world and smelling flowers, but Belgian Malinois also need access to a large, fenced yard or an area where they can safely run around. Your dog would also love to be your biking or running partner. Agility, tracking, flyball, or dock diving (Mals have incredible jumping skills) should also thrill your pup.",
  "ideal_environment": "A city apartment without outdoor space for racing and romping won’t suit a Belgian Malinois’ temperament or physicality. This breed isn’t prone to barking, but they do tend to let their parents know when they hear someone is nearby—which isn’t ideal for a compact space with close neighbors.  \n\nA Belgian Malinois’ dream home has good-sized yard or regular access to public acreage, such as a park, dog beach, wooded trails, or bike paths. \n\nWith solid training, a Belgian Malinois makes a great family pet, as long as both your pup and kids know to respect each other’s spaces and their time together is supervised.",
  "health_description": "Belgian Malinois are a fairly healthy breed, but there are a few conditions to watch out for. \r\n\n\t• Cancer: Hemangiosarcoma is a common cancer that affects the cells that line the blood vessels. It can develop anywhere in the body, but it’s usually found on the skin, spleen, liver, and heart. If the cancer isn’t extensive, surgery and chemotherapy, may be recommended to remove or shrink the tumor. \nEye issues: The three most common eye problems in the Belgian Malinois are cataracts, chronic superficial keratitis (pannus), and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). While there is no treatment for PRA, dogs often adjust well to vision loss. Pannus can be treated with drug therapy, and surgery is the go-to treatment for cataracts. \nHip and elbow dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is when the ball of the femur isn’t properly positioned in the hip socket, and elbow dysplasia alters the function of the elbow joint. Both are caused by abnormal joint development, and both can lead to pain, an inability to walk properly, and arthritis in dogs.",
  "history_description": "Recognized as an official American Kennel Club (AKC) breed in 1959, the Belgian Malinois’ origins can be traced to the city of Malines, Belgium, which is responsible for the dog’s name.  \n\nIn Belgium, Mals were valued on farms and ranches, keeping track of sheep and cattle herds. The breed came to the U.S. in 1911 and grew in popularity until World War II, when the import of European dogs was halted. Then in the 1960s, Belgian Malinois became popular once again. \n\nThis pup isn’t nearly as well-known as their near-doppelgänger, the German Shepherd, but the Belgian Malinois temperament and their talents are also highly coveted by police and military as service dogs. Cairo, a famous Belgian Mal, is remembered as a pup of exceptional bravery who went with members of the U.S. Navy Seal Team Six to help in the raid on Osama Bin Laden in 2011. \n\nA Belgian Malinois puppy can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou may also be able to adopt a Belgian Malinois. Search for a Belgian Malinois rescue in your area, such as the New York Belgian Malinois Rescue, or check out Mission Rescue K9, an organization devoted to giving working service dogs like Belgian Malinois a good retirement home with a loving pet parent. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do Belgian Malinois shed?",
      "answer": "Yes, Belgian Malinois shed twice a year in the spring and fall, but you can keep their short, thick fur under control by brushing it every day in those seasons. Head outside to give your pup a good brushing, which will keep all that extra fur out of your house."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you pronounce Belgian Malinois?",
      "answer": "To pronounce Belgian Malinois, it might help to put on a beret and eat a baguette. French is an official language of Belgium, and this pup has a French name. It’s OK if you didn’t study French in school; just say BEL-juhn mahl-uhn-WAH (the “s” is silent)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Belgian Malinois good with kids?",
      "answer": "The Belgian Malinois can be a good family dog if training and socialization happen early on. They do have a very high energy level, so supervision is always recommended around Mals and small kids."
    },
    {
      "question": "Belgian Malinois vs. German Shepherd: What’s the difference?",
      "answer": "It’s easy to confuse Belgian Malinois and German Shepherds, as they look very similar and are both often found in fields like search and rescue or as police dogs.  \n\nBut there are a few key differences: Belgian Malinois tend to weigh slightly less and live a couple years more, and their muzzle is more pointed than a German’s Shepherd’s more square snout. While they both have high energy levels, the Belgian Malinois needs the most exercise of the two breeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Dutch Shepherd vs. Belgian Malinois: What’s the difference?",
      "answer": "While most Belgian Malinois are fawn or mahogany (with black tips at the ends of their fur), the Dutch Shepherd is most likely to be a brindled color, or faintly tiger-striped in shades of silver or gold.  \n\nMals are also somewhat larger, but both breeds are among the most energetic ones out there."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are there so many Belgian Malinois in law enforcement?",
      "answer": "Loyal, smart, and athletic, these dogs also have a strong work ethic. Together, these admirable traits point to the reason there are so many Belgian Malinois military and police pups."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a Belgian Malinois cost?",
      "answer": "The Belgian Malinois price varies by where you live, the puppy’s bloodline, and whether they’ve received specific training. Expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000."
