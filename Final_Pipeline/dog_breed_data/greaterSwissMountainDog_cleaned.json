  "breed_intro": "If you love to explore the great outdoors, it makes sense to choose a pet with nature right there in their name. Enter the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. This breed is confident, playful and independent with serious athletic ability—think of them as the star quarterback of the dog world. And Swissies are just as loyal as they are athletic, meaning they'll prefer doing anything that involves you, their BFF. So lace up your hiking boots, because the day is going to be a great adventure.",
  "appearance_description": "Of all the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog's physical attributes, their soulful eyes are perhaps the most endearing. These dogs can be hefty, often weighing nearly as much their pet parents! A Swissy's short coat always comes in the same black, white, and rust colors, but you'll see many distinctive and unique markings in these bold and loyal dogs.",
  "temperament_description": "You can think of Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs, with their large size and endearingly social personalities, as big, friendly giants. They generally love meeting new people and have outgoing personalities. That social tendency also means they don't enjoy being left alone without their families for long and are very fond of snuggling.\r\n\r\nOne well-loved trait of this breed is their ability to bond strongly with their families. They particularly enjoy spending time with children, although parents need to be vigilant as Swissies can be very enthusiastic and forget their size when playing—possibly toppling younger children in the process! Proper training and socialization will help them learn self-control and manners around smaller or more fragile members of your family. It also greatly helps to teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs can get along well with cats as long as they're properly introduced. These dogs have an impressive herding drive and a complimentary prey drive, so teaching puppies how to properly interact with other pets is on the list of life lessons for your new friend.\r\n\r\nThey can have a slight stubborn streak (like most of us, let's be honest), which means they need patient and calm parents to balance them out. You'll need to be confident in your abilities in guiding the pup to channel the dog's powerful playfulness in the right direction using positive training techniques. Translation: Reward their good behavior with praise, toys and of course, treats. (It's really all about the treats.)\r\n\r\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs are watchdogs but not guard dogs. They may sound the alarm with plenty of deep, throaty barking when a stranger approaches your home, but most strangers will be greeted with friendliness once they cross the threshold. These pups enjoy keeping an eye on the neighborhood and will tell you about anything out of the ordinary with a bark or two.",
  "care_description": "Good news: Taking care of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog doesn't have to be a full-time job. Their coats are low-maintenance (though they do shed a bit), so you won't be spending lots of time or money on grooming. Instead, plan to work in dedicated sessions each day for socializing, exercising and training these high-energy pups.",
  "grooming_description": "For most of the year, the Swissy is a low-maintenance breed. Here are some grooming tips for your Greater Swiss Mountain Dog:\n\n \t• Brushing: Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs only require a quick brushing once a week to maintain their silky coats. A two-sided brush, like the ConairPROPET brush, pulls double-duty as the pin brush side will remove the dead hair and the bristle brush side will keep your dog's topcoat looking sleek and shiny. The Swiss Mountain Dog sheds heavily twice a year, in the spring and fall, in a process known as blowing their coat. A dog who blows their coat will shed it in chunks of fur instead of shedding individual hairs. During that time, you'll need to use a dog deshedding tool, like the FURminator, to remove the shedding undercoat every day. They might not shed quite as much as their close (and longer-haired) cousin, the Bernese Mountain Dog, but you'll still encounter a significant amount of fluff.\n Bathing: Swissies are generally very clean, so you shouldn't need to bathe them more than once every two months for most of the year. During shedding season, you may want to up the frequency to once a week as this can help get ahead of any loose hairs.\nNail trimming: Trim your Swissy's nails when you hear the tell-tale clip-clap on hard flooring, about once a month. Start teaching them to accept this chore from puppyhood by rubbing their paw pads regularly—it helps them get used to having their paws touched.\nDental care: Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs' teeth need brushing daily to avoid gum disease and plaque buildup. Start this process while your dog's a puppy to help them get used to it quickly. As well as brushing at home, an annual dental deep clean by your vet is recommended.",
  "training_description": "Diligent and dedicated training brings out the best of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog's brains and brawn. As a large breed, Swissies take time to mature mentally and physically, and they're independent and intelligent, too. They need a calm and confident leader who understands these pups need patience and consistency in training them. First-time pup parents can be frustrated with the challenges of training this breed, making Swissies a better choice for someone with previous dog experience.\n\nWhen it comes to training your Swissy, plenty of socialization should be the priority with quality over quantity when it comes to interactions with people, other dogs and new environments. To help get them used to meeting new people and other dogs, start while they're a puppy and take them on walks to meet and sniff the people and other dogs they encounter. And enroll in puppy preschool, where they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\n\nObedience training is important for all Swissies, whether they're puppies or fully grown. Your dog needs to learn basic commands like sit, stay and come. These dogs are genetically hardwired to pull carts, so they're prone to pulling you along on walks, too. Focusing on leash training will curb that tendency, and it'll be rewarding bonding time for pet and parent alike. Be sure to use rewards like treats, praise and playtime to encourage your pup when they do a good job.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog breed typically thrives on a complete and balanced high-quality commercial dog food. Choose a food that's designed specifically for large-breed puppies (like Hill's Science Diet Puppy Large Breed dry dog food) or adult dogs (like Hill's Science Diet Adult Large Breed dry dog food) to make sure they receive all the nutrients they require; and don't forget to choose a food that's appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult or senior). Look at the packaging for a statement that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things to consider when raising a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is the fact that, like many large dog breeds, they're slow to mature, and that's OK. It's essential to avoid rapid weight gain, which can cause orthopedic disorders as your puppy grows up. The easiest way to achieve this is to provide the correct nutrition and not overfeed them, as this can lead to preventable health issues, including obesity and joint problems.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to include the treats you give in your daily meal plan. Those calories count, too! If you see your dog gaining extra weight, speak with your vet. They can help you develop a customized nutrition plan based on your dog's needs to shed the weight and still maintain their optimal nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have plenty of energy and will enjoy 30 minutes of walking a day. They love the great outdoors, so include them on hikes or long walks in nature. They're not, however, suited for jogging.\n\nThis working breed was originally used by farmers, herdsmen and merchants and was bred for a variety of tasks, including guarding and drafting (pulling carts). Swissies are able to pull up to 3,000 pounds! They can perform well in a variety of dog sports, including drafting, weight pulling, herding, agility, dock diving, conformity (dog shows) and more. They're game for trying anything, as long as it means more time with you. Before you do try a new activity, check in with your vet to make sure your pup is physically healthy and up to the task.\n\nSwissies aren't very well-adapted to hot conditions, so take care not to overwork your dog in hot weather and keep your exercises to the cooler parts of the day.\n\nA note about puppies: Large-breed dogs like the Swissy take longer to grow up, and care needs to be taken to support their growing joints and growth plates. Keep puppy exercise more low-key (like walks) and avoid more strenuous activity (like dog sports) until they're fully grown, around 2 years old.",
  "ideal_environment": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs love nothing more than being part of your world, whether that's just you or a family. They crave attention, physical contact and lots of activity. Swissies won't enjoy being left home alone or out in the backyard without company.\r\n\r\nWith plenty of socialization and training, Swissies can live alongside other pets, including cats, very happily. They can have a high prey drive, so all your leash training will come in handy when a squirrel or bunny runs across the street on evening walks.\r\n\r\nThis breed absolutely needs a family that can provide the physical and mental activity they need to thrive. Give your Swissy a job, like a dog sport or pulling kids in a cart, and they will make sure it gets done! They love to watch over their pet parents but will also enthusiastically participate in anything else you ask of them. Swissies are independent and need a confident, consistent leader to guide them, making the dog a better choice for an experienced pup parent.\r\n\r\nSome Swissies don't cope with heat very well—which isn't too surprising when you consider their Alpine origins. If you live where it gets warm, keep your outdoor activity to the cooler parts of the day and keep the AC going when inside.\r\n\r\nOne of the classic Greater Swiss Mountain Dog traits is keeping a keen eye on their surroundings and barking whenever something seems outs of place. However, they tend to be both confident and kind around strangers, so they don't make great guard dogs.\r\n\r\nBecause these dogs are large and very active, they need a home and yard with lots of room to move around and run. This makes them an unsuitable choice for people living in small spaces, like apartments and condos.",
  "health_description": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have a life expectancy of 8-11 years, and they suffer from fewer complaints than many other large-breed dogs. It’s a good idea to get familiar with the health problems that affect this breed, so you can work with your vet to keep your dog as healthy as possible. Always ask breeders for the results of your dog’s health tests, and if you’re adopting from a shelter, request a copy of the vet wellness exam. \r\n\n \t• Orthopedic Problems: As with many large breeds, Swissies can suffer from hip and elbow dysplasia as well as osteochondritis (OCD). Dysplasia is caused when the joint isn’t formed properly, causing the dog pain. OCD is a condition that occurs when growing cartilage does not properly turn into bone. This results in an abnormally thick cartilage layer that may tear, resulting in inflammation and discomfort. Limping can be a symptom of dysplasia and OCD. Dysplasia may be treated with weight management, medications, physical therapy or surgery. OCD may be treated through exercise restriction or surgery, depending on the severity. \r\n \t• Gastrointestinal Issues: As with many deep-chested breeds, gastric torsion (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) can be an issue for the Swissy. Symptoms include a swollen abdomen, non-productive retching, drooling, restlessness and abdominal pain. You can help prevent this condition by feeding your dog smaller meals throughout the day with a  slow feeding bowl and avoiding strenuous exercise for an hour before and after meals. Splenic torsion can occur when the blood supply to the spleen twists on itself. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, vomiting and severe weight loss. Both conditions are life-threatening and need immediate veterinary intervention. \r\n \t• Urinary Incontinence: When it comes to potty troubles, the inability to “hold it” can affect puppies as well as spayed adult females. Medications are often used to treat the condition. \r\n \t• Eye Problems: Swissies can suffer from slow-growing cataracts, distichiasis and entropion. Distichiasis involves extra eyelashes growing in the incorrect position, often scratching the eye and may be treated with medicated eye drops or surgery. Entropion is when the eyelid folds inwards and can be treated with surgery. Both can cause pain, corneal irritation and damage. \r\n \t• Epilepsy: This disorder causes seizures. The cause is unknown, but many experts believe that it may be inherited. Seizures typically show up between 1-5 years old. Depending on the severity, symptoms are usually managed with medication.",
  "history_description": "The exact origin of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is unclear, but they're believed to be descendants of the war dogs used by Roman Legions during their invasion of the Alps. Swissies belong to a group of dogs known as \"Sennenhunds,\" and in their native Switzerland are known as Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund or Grand Bouvier Suisse. The other breeds within the Sennenhund group include the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Appenzeller, and the Entlebucher Mountain Dog.\r\n\r\nUp to the early 1800s, the Swissy was used by Alpine dairy farmers who found it cheaper to train dogs to pull carts instead of horses. This breed worked hard as draft dogs and hauled carts filled with dairy and meat to local markets. Swissies were also used as a general farm dog, watched over cattle and were good-natured and loyal family companions.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1800s, automation and mechanization meant the breed wasn't needed for work, and their population decreased dramatically. In an attempt to preserve the breed, the Swiss Kennel Club recognized the dog in 1910. The first dogs were brought to the US in 1968, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog in 1995, and they're a member of the Working group (the dogs bred with a job to do).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the best place to find Swissy puppies, the AKC keeps a list of reputable breeders, as does the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America. A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog puppy costs 1,500-$3,000. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also adopt a Swissy, either from a rescue organization that focuses specifically on this breed, like the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Rescue Foundation, or from your local animal shelter. Or, search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
