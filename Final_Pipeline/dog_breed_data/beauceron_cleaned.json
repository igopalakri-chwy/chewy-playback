  "breed_intro": "Adventure lovers, activate! Get ready to be part of a dynamic duo with a Beauceron in your life. Smart, affectionate, energetic and surprisingly gentle considering they were bred for boar herding, hunting and guarding, Beaucerons will be happy to tackle any adventure that comes their way, as long as they're with you. Day of hiking? No problem. Running a few dog sport courses? Absolutely. Defenders of the realm? Fighting crime? Well... they might accidentally topple a criminal to the ground in their enthusiastic greeting. You'll need to teach them who's boss early and often, but no matter what the journey, the unique and regal Beauceron is with you for the ride, from start to finish.",
  "appearance_description": "The Beauceron's dark, expressive eyes are always alert, hinting at the dog's intelligence and quick mind. The powerful, muscular breed may intimidate others with their impressive height and weight, but a well-trained Beauceron has a friendly energy behind all that strength. Their dark coat is highlighted with tan or red accents, or a black-and-tan coat with gray accents. They're bred to have double dewclaws on their rear legs (kind of like a big toe on humans). The dog is sometimes mistaken for a Doberman Pinscher, but Beaucerons tend to be a little stockier and have slightly longer fur.",
  "temperament_description": "This high-energy, intelligent dog loves to get out and adventure with an active family. As a friendly and regal pup, Beaucerons can adapt well to children if they're socialized from the time they're a puppy. To be extra safe with kids, you'll want to set up playpens and baby gates and close doors when needed, since the dogs can be pretty strong. Plus, they're herders, so they may try to herd smaller children. And of course, monitor their interactions when they're together, to ensure everyone—dogs and tiny, young humans alike—respect each others' boundaries.\n\nAlthough they look intimidating, Beaucerons are not aggressive. When they do run up to people, it's to greet them enthusiastically. However, Beaucerons can be trained to be effective guard dogs when needed.\n\nTheir high level of intelligence makes them easy to train, but those smarts can also lead them to feel stressed or anxious if they don't get enough mental stimulation—and it also can mean they can be comedians and get into a lot of funny antics.\n\nBeaucerons have a strong prey drive, so they may not be the best pet for homes with cats or small dogs. But early socialization can certainly help with other dogs and cats in the home. But even around other dogs, you'll want to supervise them, since they can be a little bossy when they play.\n\nBecause of their intelligence, large size and high energy levels, they may not be the best choice for first-time pet parents. But experienced pet parents who have previous experience training dogs may find a Beauceron to be a loyal companion for life.",
  "care_description": "The Beauceron breed doesn't need a lot of grooming, but they do need a lot of exercise. So while brushing and bathing won't take up a lot of your time, you will need to take them out for adventures at least a couple of times every day. Beaucerons also do best with early socialization so they can adapt well to encounters with other pets and strangers.",
  "grooming_description": "Good news! You can save the epic adventures for your vacation, rather than grooming your Beauceron. While you don't need to brush your Beauceron every day, you'll want to brush your them a few times a week with a pin brush or slicker brush to keep up with the shedding. And when the seasons change in the spring, they'll shed more, which may temporarily up your brushing game to daily.\n\nWhen it comes to baths, Beaucerons only need a dip in the bubbles about once a month, unless they get dirty while playing outside and need an extra bath. When you do bathe your Beauceron, use a good quality dog shampoo with natural ingredients and make sure they are rinsed thoroughly and dried well.\n\nLet's talk teeth. In general, many veterinarians recommend brushing your dog's teeth daily. You'll have the most success if you start brushing your dog's teeth as a puppy, so they get used to the sensation. Your veterinarian can help teach you the best tooth brushing techniques. You'll also want to visit your vet annually for professional teeth cleaning.\n\nBeaucerons may need their nails trimmed every six to eight weeks. Some, however, will naturally file down their nails through play and exercise outside. You can tell your dog needs a nail trimming when you can hear the clickety-clack of their claws on the floor before you can actually see your pup.",
  "training_description": "When you make a Beauceron puppy your family member, make sure they know who rules the roost (you, of course), as they can test boundaries that aren't clearly defined. Without guidance, you may find your Beauceron trying to become the supreme ruler of the household.\n\nThankfully, these intelligent dogs respond well to encouragement and positive reinforcement training, and they're eager to please. Treats might not motivate them, but they'll be very motivated by their favorite toy. As dogs with high prey drives, Beaucerons will respond well to training that hones in on their desire to herd, like using flirt poles (exercise equipment for dogs that entices them to chase a fast-moving lure) or Treibball (a sport where you direct your dog to move large exercise balls into a goal, like herding sheep into a pen).\n\nA good rule is to start training and socializing your Beauceron as a puppy. Some pet parents prefer the help of certified trainers, so they'll begin by taking their Beaucerons to puppy classes and then graduate to obedience training, where they learn commands like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Whether training yourself or with a professional, you'll want to make sure your dog is socialized to get along with other dogs and people. Ultimately, Beaucerons are so smart, they can be trained for some pretty impressive jobs, including being a guard dog, a hunting dog or even working with police or helping with search and rescue operations.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Beaucerons tend do well on high-quality, commercial dog food that provides a balanced diet meeting all their nutrition needs. You'll want to provide food designed for their current stage in life, whether they're a puppy, an adult dog or a senior dog. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart that will guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nBe sure and calculate any treats you may give your dog during the day, so you don't accidentally overfeed your dog. And of course, if your dog is getting a lot of exercise every day, you'll want to keep this in mind too and feed a little more accordingly. Since Beaucerons love mental challenges, they might also enjoy slow feeders and interactive toys (such as Kongs) that dispense their food through play.\r\n\r\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian. They are in the best position to help you pick the ideal food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "In order to give your Beauceron the exercise they need every day, you'll need to exercise both their minds and their bodies, totalling about two hours.\r\n\r\nTake your pup on a long walk, about an hour, and give them time to explore with their noses. Beaucerons love to run and play outdoors, so jogging and hiking can be fun activities for the both of you.\r\n\r\nThis breed also loves to guard and hunt. Since they have such a strong herding instinct, competitive sports may be a great option for Beaucerons. Consider dog sports like Treibball, where a dog pushes a large ball toward a goal. Parkour, which is an agility sport that involves running, jumping, balancing and climbing over various obstacles, is also something they'd love. Beaucerons can also take to flyball sports.\r\n\r\nAnother fun exercise your Beauceron will love is Canicross, which is a form of urban mushing where instead of pulling sleds, your dog pulls you. Mental and physical work out while spending time with their favorite person? Well that's a recipe for a very happy Beauceron.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is this: Don't skimp out on a Beauceron's exercise. If they don't get enough mental and physical stimulation, they might take out some of their pent-up energy on your favorite shoes or furniture.",
  "ideal_environment": "A Beauceron's ideal environment is one where they can spend a lot of time with their pet parents, going on adventures and outings, and in general where they can be a part of the action. Their high exercise needs make a larger home with a yard where they can run and play and get rid of pent-up energy preferable, but Beaucerons can adapt well to a smaller apartment, as long as they're taken on at least two long, brisk walks—about an hour each—every day.\r\n\r\nThe Beauceron breed can get along well with children and other pets if they've been socialized well as puppies, even though you'll still want to keep a close eye on them. Their herding instincts run deep, and they may try to herd smaller kids and other dogs. However, they might not do well in homes with cats since they have a strong prey drive.",
  "health_description": "Beaucerons have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years and are considered a healthy breed. You can help them have the fullest possible lifespan by looking out for these health issues.\r\n\n \t• Bloat: Because of their deep chest shape, Beaucerons may be susceptible to bloat, also called twisted stomach or gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV). This condition is life-threatening, so you’ll want to see a veterinarian immediately if your pet develops symptoms suspicious of bloat. Symptoms include salivating, trying to throw up without success (dry heaving or retching), pacing, breathing rapidly or acting distressed. One way to help prevent bloat is by using slow feeders and not exercising after eating. However, genetics likely play a factor and if other dogs in the family line have bloated, your pup may be at increased risk. The treatment is emergency surgery but a preventative version of this surgery to tack the stomach to the body well can sometimes help prevent bloat from occurring and is often performed at a young dog’s spay or neuter. Ask your vet about preventative gastropexy.\nHip Dysplasia: Larger dogs like Beaucerons are more prone to hip dysplasia, which is when the ball of the hip joint is loose and does not fit well into the socket. This can be painful and result in limping. While there is not a genetic screening test for hip dysplasia in dogs, it is genetic and dogs with the condition should not be used for breeding. Treatments may include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication or, in severe cases, surgery.\nAllergies: Beaucerons may also be prone to certain allergies such as seasonal or food allergies. If your pup is extra itchy, talk to your vet about allergy testing or available medications. For severe allergies, a veterinary dermatologist may be consulted.\nDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): DCM is a hereditary heart condition common among large breed dogs. It occurs when the heart becomes enlarged resulting in weak and thin heart muscle. Symptoms may include trouble breathing, cough, exercise intolerance, weakness or fainting/collapse. If you have any concerns about your pet’s heart, please see a veterinarian immediately. There is a genetic screening test so ask your breeder. Treatment is typically medications.\nEye Issues: Beauceron dogs may be prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). This is an inherited disorder that eventually results in loss of vision for dogs. There is a genetic screening test so be sure to ask your breeder. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for PRA, but dogs who lose their vision can still have excellent quality of life.\nCanine Copper-Associated Hepatitis: This is a rare condition in which copper accumulates in the liver, leading to inflammation and damage to the liver. Testing typically includes bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound and liver biopsy to diagnose this disease, and treatment will likely include medications and prescription diet.",
  "history_description": "The Beauceron's origin dates back to France in the Middle Ages. In fact, the oldest manuscript referencing the Beauceron is a Renaissance manuscript from 1578 by French naturalist M.Buffon.\r\n\r\nOne of two French sheepdogs, the Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce or the Bas Rouge. In 1896, the two breeds of French shepherd dogs were officially classified. The French shepherd dog with shorter hair was named the Beauceron and the dog with long coat was named the Briard.\r\n\r\nThroughout their history, the Beauceron has had many roles. They were used in World War I in trench warfare, as messenger dogs for the French army, and to herd and guard livestock including sheep and cattle. They've even served as police dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Beauceron was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2007 and assigned to the Herding group. (Herding breeds share an instinctual ability to control the movement of other animals.) The dog is more well known in France, while in the United States, the breed is sometimes mistaken for Doberman Pinschers.\r\n\r\nSo where is the best place to find Beauceron puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Beauceron breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. Depending on the breeder, expect the Beauceron average cost to be anywhere from $1,000 to more than $2,000, depending on health and temperament screenings and pedigree papers. You can also reach out to rescue organizations or local animal shelters about adopting a Beauceron puppy, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
