  "breed_intro": "Cheerful, lively and ready to take charge? If that sounds like you, you've met your match with the Australian Terrier. This peppy pup would love to rule the roost if you'd let them. But Australian Terriers are most happy when paling around with their bestie (that's you!), whether that's running errands, hiking your favorite trail or taking a stroll through the neighborhood. These pups love to keep all your attention for themselves; they're happiest when they're your only pet. Their whole goal in life is to spend every moment with you—and that's a goal you're ready to take on.",
  "appearance_description": "The Australian Terrier is a small, solid dog with a long body and neck and short legs. With intelligent-looking eyes, pricked ears (ears that stand up) and a pert tail, they're an alert and attentive-looking breed. You'll find them in a range of coat colors, from blue and tan to red or sandy.",
  "temperament_description": "The personality of the Australian Terrier breed is generally joyful and upbeat—these dogs are a bundle of energy. They are the type of pup to keep their family entertained, but they'll get into mischief (aka chewing things, excessive barking) if they aren't sufficiently exercised or if they're left alone for too long. Because Aussies were bred to be companions, in addition to keeping vermin, like rats, off the farm, they bond strongly with their families and can get very attached to humans. If you're someone with a busy travel or work schedule, the Australian Terrier might not be the breed for you.\r\n\r\nDespite their devotion to their pet parents, this isn't your happy-go-lucky Golden Retriever who'll bound up to strangers and lick their face. Australian Terriers can be aloof with people they don't know well—children, neighbors or strangers. They'd choose gardening with their parent at home over mingling at a neighborhood block party any day of the week. But socialization, starting when they're a puppy, will help them get used to meeting new people and situations.\r\n\r\nAustralian Terriers do best as the only dog in your home. Because they were bred to hunt vermin, small pets, like cats and bunnies, will be high on their list of things to chase—best to keep them in a home without any kitties or critters.\r\n\r\nDue to their intelligence and innate desire to hunt prey, these dogs are strong-willed and independent thinkers. They have the terrier characteristics to want to be the leader, but with the right approach and experienced pet parents, they can be well-trained.",
  "care_description": "Australian Terriers have moderate care needs. Despite looking like their cousins, the high-maintenance Silky and the Yorkshire Terriers, these pups are relatively easy to groom. However, with their high energy levels and independent nature, you'll be bonding with your pup over lots of time training and playing together.",
  "grooming_description": "Australian Terriers are really low maintenance when it comes to their coat care. This dog's coat is more than just for looks—the Australian Terrier uses their coat for protection. In the Australian Outback, the longer hair around their neck protects them against snake bites when nosing around in the brush, so their neck ruff should be left intact. Their coat also acts as a defense against the elements. They're a double-coated breed, and that coat keeps them warm in the winter, and in the summer, it regulates their body temperature and protects them from sunburn.\n\nHere are some grooming tips for your Australian Terrier:\n\n \t• Brushing: Because their coats are so low-maintenance, many pet parents handle grooming themselves. To care for your Australian Terrier's coat, brush it once a week using a stripping comb or knife to remove the dead hair, keep the coat from getting matted and maintain that signature terrier look. There's no need to give this breed a haircut.\nEar cleaning: While you're brushing your pup, peek inside their ears once a week to check for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \nNail trimming: Your pup's nails will most likely need a trim about once a month. If they get too long, it can be more difficult for your pup to walk and even lead to arthritis. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear your pup tap dancing on your kitchen floors.\nBathing: These dogs don't require frequent bathing, so aim to pop them in the tub no more than three to four times a year unless they've played in something particularly stinky or muddy.\nDental care: Brush your Australian Terrier's teeth daily to defend against periodontal disease, and schedule an annual professional cleaning with your vet. Be sure to familiarize your Aussie with the toothbrush when they're a puppy, so they're used to the process as they get older.",
  "training_description": "Australian Terriers respond well to structure and routine, and keeping them on a schedule can make training them much easier. Everyone likes to be rewarded when they do a good job, so be sure to use lots of treats and praise when your Australian Terrier does the right thing. (This is known as positive reinforcement training.) Start with the basics of obedience, like sit, stay and come, and be sure to teach them how to walk nicely on a leash.\n\nIf you find your Australian Terrier puppy doesn't take easily to house training, don't fret! Sometimes small dogs are just harder to train; they have small bladders and need to go out more often, and their potty time cues may not be as instantly recognizable as a larger dog's. Consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them when they potty outside. (Be sure to use the same cue words, like “Let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.)\n\nCrate training is a great way to help potty train your puppy. Dogs like to keep their “dens\" clean, and a crate that's just the right size mimics that den-like feel. Find a crate that fits the “Goldilocks\" zone: not too small and not too large. You want a crate with enough room they can turn around in, not one so large your puppy chooses to use one end as a bathroom.\n\nAustralian Terriers are not naturally friendly; socialization is crucial to help these pups get used to meeting new people and other dogs and other social situations. Starting while they're a puppy, take your dog on walks and let them sniff and meet new people and other friendly dogs. Enroll in puppy preschool, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and interact with other pup parents all in one location.\n\nOne characteristic you might need to work on with your Australian Terrier is excessive barking. It's natural for them to bark at visitors, strangers or other dogs, but you can teach them to know when to bark and when to keep their thoughts to themselves. It's important to remember that, while you can teach your pup to curb their natural instincts, like barking and chasing, you'll never train these traits completely out of your dog.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Because Australian Terriers are so active, it's important to feed them a high-quality commercial dog food that sustains them on those long walks and chase sessions in the yard. Be sure to choose a formula that fits their age and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Talk to your veterinarian about the best food and feeding schedule for your individual dog.\r\n\r\nOne topic of conversation that might come up with older dog is obesity—something many small dogs struggle with as they age. It's important not to overfeed your Australian Terrier, as obesity can limit their mobility and lead to other health issues down the road like heart disease.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably go through quite a few treats during obedience training, but remember that treats equal calories. Instead of always rewarding your pup with food, give your dog playtime with a special toy you only use during training or give them a massage.\r\n\r\nWhen feeding your Australian Terrier, watch out for food sensitivities and allergies. If you notice your dog isn't doing well with a particular food—symptoms may include itching, vomiting or diarrhea—consult your vet right away. They can help you determine what's causing your pup's symptoms and the best course of action, whether that's a change in food or medication.",
  "exercise_description": "The Australian Terrier's short legs may lead you to believe they prefer a short stroll down the sidewalk to a mountain hike, but don't underestimate these energetic and adventurous dogs. Plan on 60-90 minutes of exercise throughout the day.\n\nThey need vigorous exercise and play sessions several times a day, whether that takes the form of a long walk in the woods, an off-leash romp in a fenced yard or a rousing game of hide-and-seek. Australian Terriers play well with older kids and young children they're already comfortable with and will run circles around them for days before tiring themselves out.\n\nIt's important to keep these pups on a leash if you're not in an enclosed area, like a fenced backyard. These dogs have a very high prey drive and will chase when they see something that needs chasing. So, for their safety and your mental well-being, keep them on a leash when out and about.\n\nAustralian Terriers are smart cookies; be sure to engage their brains as well as their bodies. You may want to participate in dog sports, like agility, or give them a job to do, like pick up their toys or socks or shoes left lying around the house. You can also give them a few puzzle toys to solve on those days when you can't get outside to run and play.",
  "ideal_environment": "Australian Terriers love a home where they can run around to their heart's content, making a home with a fenced yard they can speed around on their Top 10 list. Their compact size makes them ideal for apartments, but you'll need to be able to give them the abundant exercise they need every day. Without it, they'll annoy your neighbors as they sing the song of their people. All. Day. Long.\r\n\r\nAustralian Terriers are active little pups who love adventure; they will not be happy left at home with their thoughts. And because they're so active and think they're pretty smart, they're better suited for pet parents who have experience training dogs.\r\n\r\nThese pups have an affinity for both children and the elderly. They can be very gentle with kids, particularly if they're introduced to them as puppies. While they prefer to be the only dog in the home, Australian Terriers can get along with other dogs if raised together. They won't do well with another Australian Terrier of the same sex, though, as both will vie to be top dog. And because of their high prey drive, they don't mix well with small animals like cats or rabbits.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are not the most welcoming with strangers or people they don't know well, so they may not thrive in homes that are \"party central.\" Socialization can help, but they'll never be as friendly as a Biewer Terrier.",
  "health_description": "While Australian Terriers are generally a hardy breed with a good life expectancy of 11-15 years, they’re prone to a few health problems that you should be aware of before bringing them into your home. \r\n\n \t• Diabetes Mellitus: Australian Terriers have a risk of developing diabetes mellitus, which looks like Type 1 diabetes in humans. This is a genetic disease rather than a diet-related condition; and while there is currently no genetic testing for diabetes in dogs, responsible breeders won’t use dogs with diabetes in their breeding programs. Symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst, increased peeing and appetite and weight loss. If your pet is having any of these issues, it is recommended to contact their veterinarian for an examination and likely bloodwork. \r\n \t• Luxating Patella: Common in small breed dogs, a luxating patella is where the kneecap can shift sideways (luxate) out of its normal position. You’ll often see your pup skip for a few steps or even shake their leg. Often, the knee will slip back into place on its own. Treatment may include joint supplements and weight management. \r\n \t• Legg-Calve-Perthes: This is a heredity condition affecting the hip joint in small breed dogs. Dogs affected will typically have a slowing progressing back leg limp affecting one or both back legs. It is diagnosed by X-rays and treated with surgery. \r\n \t• Cataracts: Cataracts create a clouding of the lens of the eye results in decreased or lost vision. There are over 115 genes known to cause cataracts, so genetic screening is not always practical. However, surgical treatment may help to restore vision in affected pups. \r\n \t• Epilepsy: Australian Terriers are prone to seizures and genetic testing may help screen at risk dogs. Often seizures can be well managed in dogs with daily medication.",
  "history_description": "The Australian Terrier hails from Australia (no surprise there!), but this dog owes their origins to the British settlers who brought working terriers \"Down Under.\" The development of this breed started around 1820, when they were called Rough Coated Terriers; they became known as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The breed's ancestors include the Norwich Terrier, the Scottish Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The word \"terrier,\" from terre and tera, the French and Latin words for earth, refers to these dogs' tendency to burrow.\n\nLike other prey-driven dogs, including the Cairn Terrier and Dandie Dinmont, the Australian Terrier was (and still is!) adept at hunting rats, mice and snakes on farms and homesteads. Their double coats protected them against the extreme temperatures of the Australian Outback, while the long hair on their necks and chests defended against snake bites. These dogs were keen and fearless hunters, and their instinct to hunt small animals remains to this day.\n\nIn spite of their hunting prowess, and unlike some terrier breeds, Australian Terriers had a dual purpose: they were also bred to be companion dogs. While they worked hard at their outdoor jobs, they were equally happy to keep farm families company inside the home. The Australian Terrier was Australia's first officially recognized dog and was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1960, having first been introduced to the US in the 1940s.\n\nIf you want one of these dogs in your life, the price for a purebred Australian Terrier puppy can range $1,300-$1,500 or more. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. These dogs are relatively rare in North America and can be difficult to find in an animal shelter, but you can check with the Australian Terrier Rescue group to adopt a pup. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
