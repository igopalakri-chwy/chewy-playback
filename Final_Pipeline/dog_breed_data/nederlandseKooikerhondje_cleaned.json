  "breed_intro": "Always on the go? Don't have time for mindless chitchat? Love crossing things off your to-do list? The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje just may be your soulmate (and just may have the longest name of all the dog breeds!). Pronounced ney-der-lan-dsuh koy-ker-hoon-tyeh (which means \"decoy man\" in Dutch), these pups are happiest when they have a job to do. When you don't give them one, they'll get bored—fast. And like a little kid, they'll lay on your sofa whining, \"Bored. Bored. Bored. OMG, bored!\" So, grab your backpack and hit the road—this little pup just may be your new raison d'être.",
  "appearance_description": "You can't help but fall in love as soon as you lay your eyes on a Nederlandse Kooikerhondje dog. Boasting an amazing, autumn-inspired coat of orange-red and white, these pups were built for speed and agility. (They were bred to hunt and need to be fast to catch their quarry.) Their white-plumed tail, black-tipped ears and dark little nose complete the picture-perfect package.",
  "temperament_description": "From the minute you bring your Nederlandse Kooikerhondje puppy home, socialization is important—and will be a lifelong staple. They shower their friends and family with love and want to stay as close as possible, often lying on their feet. But they follow the “stranger danger\" mentality, which is why it's important to properly introduce them to all newcomers (both two- and four-footed). Puppy \"mouthing\" and biting are also 100 percent to be expected, but with proper training and socialization, they fade away as they grow up.\n\nYour Kooiker will match you wit for wit. At times, you may look into those expressive eyes and see a challenge brewing. (Just who's really in charge here?) Just like a parent would when a child starts testing them, a pup parent needs to stay firm and not be swayed by their cuteness. Your ultimate goal is to make sure your pup knows you're protecting them and not the other way around.\n\nKooikers need to be busy, and they love it when you give them a job to do. (You can often accomplish this through involving them in dog sports such as agility, obedience and tracking.) But be warned: If you don't give them a job to do, they will create their own. And it may involve demolition duty.",
  "care_description": "The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje breed is pretty—and pretty easy to care for. To control shedding, your brushing routine only needs to show up once a week on your to-do list. In addition, their au naturel, untrimmed coat will require only an occasional scrub-a-dub-dub—often in the form of a rinse-off—which is great, 'cause you'll be spending all that extra time in training and exercising your delightful pup.",
  "grooming_description": "The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje's luxurious coat may look high maintenance, but it's not as bad as you might think. Their silky mane repels dirt and water, so less bathing is required. (There's an old Dutch saying that says you should never wash a Kooiker unless they've rolled in a dead fish.) Here are some grooming tips to keep in mind:\n\n \t• Bathing: You may bathe your pup once a month or even less frequently if they don't smell or aren't dirty. This breed is often considered to be a \"rinse-only\" dog since they have special oils in their coat that capture dirt, causing it to crumble and fall off naturally.\nBrushing: Brush your pup once a week with a bristle brush. It will help distribute the oils, keep the coat healthy and help keep their shedding in check. You can follow up with a comb (especially on the tail) to keep tangles at bay. These pups will shed more during the fall and spring months as they get ready for the weather changes. Be prepared to brush more frequently during those times. To help maintain those gorgeous locks, you may choose to take your pup to the groomer every four to six weeks.\nNail trimming: You may need to bring your pup in every four to six weeks for a nail trimming, too. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear that familiar tippy tapping on your hardwood floors.\nDental care: Brush your Kooiker's teeth every day with a gentle toothbrush designed for your dog. Start that routine early to get your Nederlandse Kooikerhondje puppy used to it. And don't forget to schedule a professional teeth cleaning by your veterinarian every year.",
  "training_description": "Big love comes in small packages. Rightfully so, the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje is often called the “little white-and-orange dog with a big heart.\" Indeed, they are about the same size as a Cocker Spaniel but smarter—and they won't let you forget it. The intelligent nature of the Kooiker sets the stage for successful training; however, as with any clever type of dog, you will need to stay one step ahead of them.\n\nGet ready to go to school with your pup! They'll benefit from puppy classes (learning to play with other dogs and people), obedience classes (where they'll learn commands like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash) and Canine Good Citizen. Structure with a capital \"S\" is important for this breed as they love to wander on \"sniffaris.\" (So many things to smell!)\n\nYou'll need a lot of patience and positive motivations to keep your dog on track. Use lots of praise, toys and treats to reward your pup. And everyone who lives with the Kooiker must be included in training—it's all hands on deck! Harness their intelligence, make training matter, and you'll be rewarded with a lifetime of successes and laughs.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A complete and balanced diet is important to satisfy your Nederlandse Kooikerhondje's nutritional needs. Look for a high-quality dog food that fits your pup's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you choose a formula that's best for your individual dog. They can also help you set the portions and times for your pet's meals.\r\n\r\nBecause Kooikers love learning new things, you'll be doling out lots of treats as they learn new tricks. But treat calories count, too! Your vet can help you factor in all those delicious snacks in their overall meal plan, so they stay at a healthy weight. And of course, make sure you have clean, fresh water available for your pup throughout the day.",
  "exercise_description": "Because Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes are so independent, exuberant and energetic, you will need to work your way into their good graces, gain their cooperation and show them a good time. Given the task they were originally bred to perform—duck hunting in the Netherlands—this streak of self-sufficiency and demand for activity should come as no surprise. And they'll \"demand\" at least an hour of exercise every day. The key is to keep their lively spirits high by engaging them with challenging tasks and activities that stimulate their sense of purpose and playfulness.\n\nYou can take them on long walks or jogs, but it's a good idea to mix it up to keep it interesting, so add games like “Find the Treat\" (to practice scent work), Frisbee or fetch (retrieving). They excel in scent work, agility and obedience, which are great if you have a slight competitive streak. (And your pup will love it.)\n\nCreating opportunities for activities that play to their natural instincts will help them feel like they've accomplished a “job well done,\" and that they are pulling their weight as a part of the family.",
  "ideal_environment": "For the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje, home-sweet-home has a fenced back yard for exercise and adventure. Prepare to fully engage with this “play with me\" breed and know that, while the dog loves children, they'd prefer to be playing outside. So, tie those two things together and you've got a match made in canine heaven.\r\n\r\nKooikers are affectionate and sensitive companions to their people, but they like routine and quiet, which is why they tend to fare better in households without little ones who may surprise them with middle-of-the-night crying, unpredictability and disorder.\r\n\r\nEven still, they are often referred to as a family dog. These pups are happiest when they're included as part of a family of older children who embraces a mantra of mutual respect. As with any dog, it's important to socialize and train a dog as well as teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nHaving a Kooiker as a pet is rewarding, but you'll need to devote a fair amount of time to them. They will want to be with you, do things with you and be of service to you. They need space, socialization and ample opportunities to show off their smarts and their skills. Let them work it, baby!",
  "health_description": "Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes have a lifespan of 12-15 years and, like most any other breed, are susceptible to a few hereditary conditions. It’s a good idea to be aware of these health problems, so you can help your pup live a full and happy life. \r\n\n \t• Von Willebrand Disease (VWD): This is a genetic disorder that prevents a dog from clotting blood properly, which can lead to excessive bleeding if injured. There is no cure for VWD, but genetic screening testing is available. In everyday life, most pups are asymptomatic, but in cases of trauma or surgery, blood transfusions may be necessary. \r\n \t• Hereditary Necrotizing Myelopathy (ENM): This is a degenerative spinal disease, similar to MS in humans. An early sign of ENM paralysis in the hind legs. There is currently no cure for ENM, and the disease is fatal, but genetic screening testing is available.  \r\n \t• Luxating Patella: This condition is when the knee slips out of its groove. Depending on the severity, it may be treated through weight management, physical therapy, pain medications or surgery. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition when the hip joint wasn’t formed properly and causes pain and lameness. Treatment options include joint supplements, pain medication or, in severe cases, surgery. \r\n \t• Polymyositis (PMN): In this disease, the muscles become inflamed, which causes muscle damage. Signs include lethargy, weakness, weight loss and lameness. There is no cure, but it can often be managed with steroids and immunosuppressants.  \r\n \t• Epilepsy: Seizures consistent with epilepsy can begin at 6 months to 5 years of age. Treatment is typically daily oral medication.",
  "history_description": "The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje originated in the Netherlands, possibly dating as far back as the 1700s—you can find them in paintings by Rembrandt and Jan Steen. These plucky pups were bred for duck hunting and were called duck decoys—but not because they look like the wooden lures used by hunters today. They were (and still are) used by hunters to lure ducks through elaborate \"canal cages\" called eendenkooi (\"duck cages\" in Dutch) into traps. Kooikers also alerted their families to poachers on the property and kept the property free of vermin. It's a similar job to that of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, the North American breed said to be descendants of the Kooiker.\r\n\r\nBecause of their heritage, Kooikers are often referred to as Dutch spaniels. The breed nearly died out after World War I, when more accurate rifles were available to duck hunters. But the breed was saved by Baroness von Hardenbroek van Ammerstol in the late 1930s, when she sought out the little dogs throughout the Dutch countryside and brought them back from the brink of extinction. The Dutch are so attached to their canine counterpart that they've kept a breeding registry of all the litters bred since 1942.\r\n\r\nThe first Nederlandse Kooikerhondje litter was born in the US in 1999, and the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje Club of the United States was formed in 2014. The breed officially joined the ranks of the American Kennel Club in 2018.\r\n\r\nWhere can you find a Nederlandse Kooikerhondje puppy? You can find reputable breeders on the AKC's website. What's the average price for a Kooiker puppy? You can expect to spend between $1,000-$5,000 for a Kooiker puppy. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact Nederlandse Kooikerhondje rescues, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.",

      "question": "How do you pronounce Kooikerhondje?",
      "answer": "Nederlandse Kooikerhondje may not be easy to pronounce, unless you're familiar with Dutch. It's pronounced ney-der-lan-dsuh koy-ker-hoon-tyeh, which is why many refer to the Dutch dynamo as a \"Kooiker\" (koy-ker). That nickname makes perfect sense, too: It means “decoy man\" in Dutch, heralding the breed's original job as a duck decoy."

    {
      "question": "Are Kooikerhondjes good family dogs?",
      "answer": "Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes make good family dogs as long as they are properly socialized and trained from an early age. They do well with older kids, but need to be supervised around infants and toddlers. Because they were bred to be hunters (super-alert and aware of their surroundings), Kooikers may respond to noises and sudden movements, so early socialization is key to help these pups be well-behaved members of the family. It's also important to ensure all children all taught how to properly interact with dogs."
