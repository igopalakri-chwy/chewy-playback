  "breed_intro": "With an English Cocker Spaniel, your days will be merry and bright. Joyful times await an English Cocker Spaniel pet parent, as this affectionate dog gets along well with just about everyone—two- and four-legged friends alike. They're super intelligent and eager to please, making training sessions a snap. And they're at home just about anywhere, so long as regular promenades are on the schedule. Why? All the better to show off their lustrous fur coats and long ears that swish-swish (you can almost hear it!) when they walk.",
  "appearance_description": "The English Cocker Spaniel breed is a heavenly vision in canine form with long satiny fur and swinging ears that sway to their rhythm. As a sporting dog (a dog bred to work with hunters), the English Cocker has a compact build and a swift gait. The icing on this pup-cake is a graceful neck and sweet tail that never seems to idle.",
  "temperament_description": "The English Cocker Spaniel's temperament is delightful—this little pup is eager to learn and please. With a playful personality and loads of smarts, an English Cocker pup gets along well with other dogs in the home and can even mix with cats.\n\nSweet English Cocker Spaniels are great with kids and are not huge barkers, so they're easy to have in small homes and apartments. Your neighbor won't bang on the wall to complain. Instead, she'll ask to come over and pet your pretty pooch!\n\nStill, as with all dogs, early socialization is a must. If you start early, you'll get your pup used to their new environment, which means they'll react in a friendly way in unfamiliar situations, with strangers and other canines. The English Cocker Spaniel puppy is typically easy to train since they're motivated to please and intelligent.\n\nA member of the Sporting group of dogs, the English Cocker Spaniel worked alongside bird hunters to flush game from dense underbrush. So, playing fetch in the backyard is a walk in the park for this energetic animal. First-time pet parents won't struggle much to teach and train their English Cocker Spaniel puppy—their can-do attitude makes learning a pleasure.",
  "care_description": "The English Cocker Spaniel breed is one high-maintenance pooch, and they're worth it. Their coat will lead you down the brush and comb aisle at the pet store in order to maintain their luscious locks. And they also need a lot of exercise. But this gives you ample time to bond with your loving and adorable pup.",
  "grooming_description": "We won't lie: English Cocker Spaniel grooming needs are more intense than those of other breeds. But if you love playing \"doggy salon,\" this pet is for you.\n\nAs high shedders, a thorough brushing with a pin or slicker brush, then following up with a comb at least once a week, can detangle your English Cocker's profuse coat and keep mats from forming (and keep your pup show-ring ready). Trimming your dog's fur around the face, neck, feet, ears and tail each month is also part of raising an English Cocker Spaniel, but you can leave this to your groomer if you prefer.\n\nCheck your pup's long ears weekly for excess wax and debris, as they may drag on the ground and get dirtier than other body parts. A monthly nail trim and a once-a-month bath are sufficient for the English Cocker Spaniel dog, though if yours works on a farm or in a different dusty location, weekly might be necessary.\n\nLast up, oral health! Yup, dogs need their teeth brushed daily, so ask your vet for tips on how to brush a dog's teeth. (Check out our how-to guide here.) You should also schedule your English Cocker Spaniel dog for an annual professional teeth cleaning by the vet.",
  "training_description": "An English Cocker Spaniel's training isn't a struggle, as this intelligent, responsive breed is happy to learn every trick in the book. Pet parents can use the English Cocker's motivation and good nature to their advantage as long as positive reinforcement is part of the plan. (Positive reinforcement uses treats, praise and special play breaks to reward the pup for their excellent work.)\n\nKeep training treats and a calm voice handy, or you'll have trouble inspiring your spaniel. The goal: Get your little pup to love and respect you, and a rock-solid temperament and social skills will be your reward. You can also tap into your English Cocker Spaniel's nose power—they once worked as bird dogs for hours in the field. One way is to encourage training games and activities that allow your English Cocker to sniff out their rewards.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best English Cocker Spaniel food is a complete and balanced, high-quality commercial diet. Opt for a formula that matches your English Cocker's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\n\nNeed help with a feeding chart or measurements? Your veterinarian can help craft a guide to determine how much and how often to feed your dog based on their diet. You can provide English Cocker Spaniels with a home-cooked regimen if your vet okays the nutritional content.\n\nTreats are acceptable as a training enticement, but too many can cause obesity in this small dog breed. Make sure all those dog treats you dole out during training (or just because!) are accounted for when you're working out how much to feed your pup daily. And don't be tempted to feed your pup from the dinner table. Human foods, especially bones and fatty items, aren't good for them, and some may be dangerous.\n\nConsult your vet if you have any questions about your pup's mealtime plan. They can help you choose the proper food for your pup based on their unique needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Ready to run and play? Great! Because this dog requires regular exercise. An English Cocker Spaniel's love of exercise is well-known, and their energy levels are moderate, so active owners are a good match with this breed. Aim to walk your pup a couple of times a day for 30 to 45 minutes and work some games into your physical routine, totaling about an hour. Keep your pup on a leash when you're out and about so you can control their hunting instincts (a fenced yard is also great for this pup).\n\nHikes and long walks on the beach are also smart exercise options for this canine. Looking for a jogging partner? The English Cocker Spaniel has a moderate speed, so they'll do well on a few weekly jogs. You and your pup might enjoy dog sports like obedience or tracking if you're a bit competitive.\n\nEnglish Cocker Spaniel's traits include a love of nose work, which means using their sniffer to track scents and smells can be a source of entertainment and exercise. For example, you can fill a KONG toy with something delicious, then hide it in the yard. Or stash treats inside old Chewy delivery boxes or spritz chicken broth (one with no onions or garlic) from a spray bottle to mark an aromatic trail to a jackpot of toys.",
  "ideal_environment": "Affectionate by nature, the English Cocker Spaniel makes a fine family pet as they're known to be good with kids, and they get along well with other dogs and even cats in the home.\n\nThe English Cocker Spaniel breed can live happily in large and small homes in rural or urban areas, provided they receive the required amount of exercise. First-time pet parents will enjoy bringing up an English Cocker, especially if they have a playful attitude. Tossing a ball in the backyard or strolling in the park to show off their most excellent coat are two activities both pet parents and their dog will enjoy.",
  "health_description": "English Cocker Spaniels have a lifespan of 12 to 14 years, but as with any breed, they're prone to some health issues. Some are genetic, and responsible breeders will perform genetic screening testing when possible.\r\n\n\t• Ear Infections: Because the English Cocker's ears are so long and floppy, they may drag and collect dirt and debris, which could lead to an infection. Check the ears weekly and note any signs of pain, such as whining, head shaking, odor, or crustiness. Your vet may prescribe a special ear cleanser and/or topical or oral medication to treat the infection.\nHip Dysplasia: This genetic condition is a malformation of the hip joint that occurs when the hip ball doesn't sit well in the socket. Lameness and pain may be apparent; treatment can range from medications to surgery.\nPatellar Luxation: A kneecap that slips or \"floats\" rather than sits snugly in the joint is called patellar luxation, and it may cause your pup to limp or hold the leg up when walking. A vet may prescribe medication, but some dogs may need surgery.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This eye condition may develop in English Cocker Spaniels, leading the retina to degrade, causing blindness. While there's currently no cure, many dogs adjust well to sight loss. A genetic screening test is available, so be sure to ask your breeder.\nKidney Failure: Also known as familial nephropathy, this congenital malformation prevents the kidneys from excreting waste, causing your dog to exhibit increased thirst, weight loss, poor appetite and vomiting. While no cure is available, genetic screening testing is available.\nAdult Onset Neuropathy: AON, a hereditary disorder, is a type of progressive weakness and may lead your pup to have trouble walking. This condition has no cure, but genetic screening testing is available.",
  "history_description": "As some of the oldest dogs in the American Kennel Club's Sporting group, spaniels, along with setters, pointers, and retrievers, were bred to assist bird hunters, primarily those hunting grouse and woodcock. The English Cocker Spaniel's history originated in England and was developed hundreds of years ago from dogs with Spanish roots—hence the name \"spaniel,\" which comes from the word \"Spanish.\"\n\nEach of the various spaniel types had their own role to perform during the bird hunt, including water and land spaniels, springer spaniels, and field spaniels. English Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels were originally the same dog. Springers were the larger pups of the litter and were used to spring (flush) birds from the brush. The English Cocker Spaniels were the smaller pups of the litter, and their mission was to flush out woodcock, a quail-like bird, from its hiding place in dense thickets.\n\nIn the early 20th century, American breeders decided to create their own Cocker Spaniel, albeit a smaller one with a rounded, shorter head and a more lavish coat. In 1946, the AKC recognized the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker as separate breeds.\n\nToday's English Cocker has left birding behind and lives the good life as a popular family pet. The AKC lists breeder information if you'd like to purchase an English Cocker Spaniel breed. English Cocker Spaniel puppy prices typically run between $1,200 and $1,500. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America for information on rescuing a pup, watch for the breed at your local shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
