  "breed_intro": "This gentle giant lumbers along instead of trotting and leaves behind a wake of smeary drool. But if you're a quick draw with a roll of paper towels and awed by the majesty that a Mastiff brings to the table, you may want to check out this special canine. Not for the faint of heart (or anyone with tiny biceps), a Mastiff puppy requires an all-in training approach—but in return, they'll match your efforts with steadfast loyalty and love.",
  "appearance_description": "The Mastiff dog breed's heavy-boned frame contains a gentle heart. With a huge head, framed by long, soft ears, and oh-so-many expressive wrinkles, this very large pup moves slowly but with great purpose. Expect oodles of drool from their large droopy jowls but at least their short coat, which comes in fawn, apricot or brindle (subtle tiger stripes), is easy to care for.",
  "temperament_description": "Extreme loyalty and a courageous nature are the defining characteristics of a Mastiff's temperament. While a Mastiff's massive weight and height may put off some potential pet parents, this breed is quite friendly and makes an excellent family pet. If little ones are in your mix, know that with early and consistent training, having a Mastiff with kids is very doable since barking and biting aren't common to this breed. Their kindly personality extends to four-legged pals as well, which means you can often add this colossal canine to homes with cats and other dogs.\r\n\r\nA Mastiff has competency in spades, thanks to their innate intelligence and eagerness to please. As a quick learner, the Mastiff thrives on service, perhaps because this working breed has a long history of guarding and fighting alongside soldiers in battle.\r\n\r\nIt may seem counterintuitive that such a large animal might not have deep energy reserves, but this is actually the case with the Mastiff dog breed. Slow and steady wins the race here, so low-key pup parents are often the best pairing for this majestic creature.",
  "care_description": "Mastiff exercise needs are moderate and their coats are rather easy to brush—two reasons this most excellent dog breed may be the one for you. But keep in mind that this pup drools—a lot! So, you'll always need at least one towel on hand for keeping their face (and your furniture) drool-free.",
  "grooming_description": "Mastiff grooming and shedding are low-effort when compared with other breeds, and this dog's short coat and leisurely pace means they stay pretty clean. Plan on brushing your Mastiff every few days, though daily brushing is even better as it removes dead hair and keeps your pup looking sharp. As for brushing tools, most pup parents choose between a grooming mitt or a bristle brush—and as long as you brush regularly, a bath is only needed every four to six weeks.\n\nKeep your Mastiff's teeth shiny and plaque-free by striving for daily sessions with the toothbrush (work up to this goal by brushing a few times a week at first). Your vet can give you pointers if the thought of prying open a Mastiff's mouth gives you pause. And don't forget a professional teeth cleaning by the vet annually to maintain optimal dental health.\n\nTrim your Mastiff's nails once a month. You'll know they're ready for a trim when you hear them clacking on hard surfaces. Check their ears for debris, redness, swelling or mites a few times a week. Signs of ear mites include a dark debris that looks like coffee grounds in their ears or your pup shaking their head from side to side more frequently. If you notice anything speak to your vet, who may recommend at-home ear cleaning.",
  "training_description": "Much the way people respond to kindness and praise when learning something new, so too does the Mastiff. Be sure you hold your pet's gaze as you teach the various commands. The reason? This dog breed is known to communicate with eye contact. The Mastiff is also good at reading body language and their pet parents' expressions, which means wearing a smile and using positive language will go a long way. Think a dog can't have hurt feelings? Guess again—Mastiffs are truly bothered by a raised voice, and they'll check out if your teaching methods aren't engaging.\r\n\r\nExperience is a must when dealing with the training and obedience lessons that a Mastiff requires. But this pup type may become bored quickly with some of the repetitive approaches that are typically used in training classes. If your Mastiff looks away—or worse, decides to recline on the ground and take a nap—then you've lost your canine student. The best approach is to take advantage of your Mastiff's intelligence by aiming to create training sessions that are short and sweet yet still fun. Soon, you'll have a star pupil and a trained pup to take on the town.",
  "diet_nutrition": "For maximum health, all dogs require food that provides complete and balanced nutrition, and the Mastiff typically does well on a high-quality commercial large-breed dog food. Always consider your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether you have a puppy, adult or senior dog.\r\n\r\nSince this dog breed is giant and grows very quickly, proper Mastiff nutrition is especially important from the puppy stage up to 2 years of age. A feeding chart and a treat schedule makes good sense for Mastiffs as it'll help to prevent excess weight gain. Your vet can help you determine how much food to serve and when.\r\n\r\nKeep the nutrient content of your Mastiff's food top of mind since this breed requires the correct ratio of calcium to phosphorus—and without it, a skeletal disorder could develop. Protein content is also a consideration (strive for no more than 26 percent protein in your dog's adult food blend). You can always consult with your veterinarian for help picking the best food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Contrary to what you might think, big dogs don't necessarily require big, adventurous outings. Instead, a Mastiff's exercise needs are low compared with other canines, which means they're not built to race alongside as you train for that 10K. (They do not feel the need for speed.) Remember, there's a lot of weight on this very large dog's frame, so jogging long distances, especially on pavement, isn't recommended.\r\n\r\nInstead, stick to grassy surfaces and walk your full-grown Mastiff twice a day at a slower pace for a mile or two. (Aim for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.) And if you have access to a pond or pool, low-impact exercises like swimming are beneficial for this breed, as is a fenced yard where your pet can walk leisurely or fetch a tennis ball. (Check with your vet or certified trainer to see if your pup would benefit from swimming lessons first.)\r\n\r\nA Mastiff's energy level is higher as a puppy, of course, but don't allow this little guy or young adult to jump from furniture or race on the stairs. Too much activity can damage a large breed's growth plates, which are the soft areas at the end of long bones, so your best bet is to walk half a block with puppies. Lastly, don't venture too far as Mastiffs may stop and drop when pooped, leaving you (and your back!) to haul them home.",
  "ideal_environment": "Mastiffs (aka English Mastiffs) are a good match for families with children, particularly if their training starts early. Mastiffs are also compatible with other dogs and cats, and while they're best suited for large homes and yards, they'll do OK in a small home or apartment as they aren't prone to lots of barking.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, however, that petite abodes may be an issue if concrete sidewalks are the only walking surface available. A Mastiff's physical traits are best suited to soft materials underfoot, so a nearby park, dog run or wooded trail suits them best. Since low-impact exercise works well for this breed, a home with a pool or lake access is ideal.",
  "health_description": "Mastiffs have a lifespan of 6 to 10 years. As with any dog breed, certain conditions are endemic. Potential pet parents should be aware of these health issues, so they can help their pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: These conditions, which may be genetic and occur when the joints form abnormally, can cause pain and lameness in a Mastiff. Weight management and medication may be recommended, as well as surgery in more severe cases.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): Multiple dog breeds may be affected by a family of inherited progressive degenerative eye diseases. One in this category is progressive retinal atrophy or PRA, and it strikes the retina, ultimately causing blindness. While there’s no cure for PRA, Mastiffs typically get used to the vision loss and have good quality of life.\nHeart Disease: There are several possible conditions that can affect a Mastiff’s heart including issues with the heart valves and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Often one of the first signs will be a heart murmur. If your vet detects a heart murmur, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the exact cause.\nDegenerative myelopathy (DM): This inherited neurologic condition is characterized by a progressive weakness of the rear limbs and ultimately may result in the dog being unable to stand or walk. There is no cure for DM but genetic screening testing is available so be sure to ask your breeder.\nBloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Large breeds with deep chests may be affected by this condition, which is suspected of having a genetic link as well as environmental causes such as eating too fast and having only one large meal a day. Bloat can be life-threatening as the stomach fills with air then twists. This is an emergency and you should take your pup to the vet immediately if they show any of the signs which include abdominal distension, retching/dry heaving, and restlessness. To help reduce the chances of getting bloat, feed your pup with a slow feeder bowl and feed them smaller meals throughout the day.\nEpilepsy: Mastiffs are prone to this potentially inherited seizure disorder which typically begins around 6 months to 5 years of age. Treatment is most often daily oral medication.",
  "history_description": "The Mastiff enjoys a proud ancient lineage, though some confusion may erupt over mastiffs generally (as a type of dog) and Britain's Old English Mastiff, which the American Kennel Club has simply named \"Mastiff.\" Dogs known as mastiffs have thrived for millennia in Greece, Rome, China and Egypt, with hieroglyphics of Mastiff likenesses showing up on monuments in the Nile region as early as 3000 BC. In fact, today's Tibetan Mastiff and Neapolitan Mastiff breeds share a gene pool with mastiffs of yore.\r\n\r\nMastiff history is steeped in service as war dogs who fought invaders on many fronts. Caesar himself was apparently in awe of the breed when he ventured onto Britain's shores in 55 BC. He brought Mastiffs home to Rome to be matched against gladiators and wild animals such as bears, bulls, lions and tigers. Mastiffs also worked as big game hunters, guard dogs and on the battlefield in an important campaign against the French in 1415.\r\n\r\nMastiffs came to the US in the late 1800s and were used to guard plantations. The pup joined the ranks of the American Kennel Club in 1885, making them one of the first recognized breeds in the AKC.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, the Mastiff nearly died out, with just 14 remaining in England. Fortunately for this noble animal, the Mastiff was brought back from the brink by dedicated breeders. Today, this canine's combat boots have been hung up in favor of a cushier life in homes as a loyal companion.\r\n\r\nAre you thinking about a Mastiff as a pet? Mastiff prices are about $2,500 to $3,500, depending on where you live. But for that price, you'll likely get a pup who's been screened for health issues and may come with pedigree papers. The AKC Marketplace is a good place to find reputable breeders for your Mastiff puppy. You can also check with Mastiff rescues, keep an eye out at local animal shelters, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area if you want to adopt a pup.",

    {
      "question": "Do Mastiffs shed?",
      "answer": "Mastiff shedding is on the low side, comparatively, which is good news for homeowners (much less sweeping and vacuuming). Still, a Mastiff does shed once or twice a year when the seasons change, so brush more frequently, even daily, during these periods to whisk away dead fur."
