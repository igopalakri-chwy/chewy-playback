  "breed_intro": "Maltese are so cute they should probably be on magazine covers, but this plucky dog is too down-to-earth to be stuck-up about how adorable they are. Most likely, they’ll be more concerned with making sure their new best friend (that’s you) is happy.\n\nThese petite pups have been known to court queens, so consider it an honor if one has chosen to be your bestie, too. You can repay your Maltese by taking them with you to the office, to brunch, or anywhere they’re welcome. They’re delightful companions who are eager to impress.",
  "appearance_description": "The Maltese is a small dog with dark, friendly eyes; a small black nose; and white fur. While they traditionally have a long, silky coat, some pet parents give these dogs short haircuts, which are equally charming.",
  "temperament_description": "Maltese have a love for laps and their people. Their favorite place is to be wherever you are, and although they’re not among the most energetic breeds, they are lively and playful little dogs.\n\nThese friendly pups are fairly outgoing and generally get along well with other pets, provided they are properly trained and socialized with other animals. Their small size does make them fragile, so they should always be supervised around young tots and babies to make sure they’re not overwhelmed by children who mistake them for a plushie.\n\nThe tiny Maltese has a sweet personality that makes them great therapy dogs. But more than anything else, they just want a chance to sit in your lap and be close to you.",
  "care_description": "The Maltese personality is not high-maintenance, but their grooming will need your attention. They don’t have extensive exercise needs, so use that extra time to give their coat some TLC.\n\nAnd even though they love being in your lap, they need to explore the world on their own, so physical and mental enrichment are a must.",
  "grooming_description": "The Maltese needs more grooming than your average dog. Even though their long, silky fur lacks an undercoat (which means they shed less than many other dogs) they still need quite a bit of brushing.\r\n\n\t• Bathing:Bathing a Maltese too often can dry out their skin and coat. So, give your pup a bath every four to six weeks. You can even use a shampoo specifically formulated to keep their fur bright.\nBrushing:Maltese dogs need consistent brushing, even if they have a shorter haircut. Their long coat needs to be brushed every day, ideally with a pin brush to prevent tangles. Once a week, use a slicker brush to get deeper into the coat and remove any debris.\nDental care:Small dogs are prone to dental disease, so brush your Maltese’s teeth daily to control tartar. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year.\nNail care:Trim your dog’s nails once a month. If you can hear the nails clicking on hard surfaces when they walk, it’s time to trim.\nEye care: Maltese often have noticeable reddish-brown tear stains that stand out on their white coats, and you may be able to clear up the stains just by wiping your dog’s eyes and face every day with special tear stain wipes. If this isn’t enough, talk to your veterinarian about health issues that could be contributing to the staining.",
  "training_description": "Maltese just want to make their favorite person (that’s you) happy, so they’re eager to please when it comes to training. They respond great to positive reinforcement (think treats, toys, and praise for good behavior).  \n\nIf you bring home a Maltese puppy, start obedience training early; you can teach them cues like sit, stay, and come as early as 8 weeks old. Also invest some time in proper socialization, which involves exposing them to new people, places, and things in a positive manner.\n\nIf you adopt a Maltese as an adult, that’s perfect, too—chat with your vet or a certified trainer about training and socialization. It’s never too late!\n\nSome Maltese will also enjoy learning new tricks or participating in agility training. For extra mental stimulation, they may enjoy scent work.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Maltese breed typically does well on high-quality, commercial dog food. The best food for Maltese is AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Consider a diet for small-breed pups; some brands even sell dog food specially made just for Maltese.\n\nYour vet can help you decide the appropriate amount to feed your dog. You may want to incorporate mental enrichment into your dog’s meal plan, dispensing treats or kibble through food toys or interactive treat balls.\n\nRemember that treats (even ones that you use during training) count toward calories; treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "Maltese dogs don’t have the high energy levels of star athletes like Border Collies or Australian Shepherds, but they still need daily exercise to stay happy and healthy (and out of trouble!). Spend some time playing with your pup at home, and take them on at least one brisk 20- to 30-minute walk around the neighborhood every day.\n\nMaltese puppies and dogs enjoy mixing up their activities a bit. So, switch it up between walks, indoor games, fetch in a fenced yard, and mental enrichment exercises like scent work or interactive toys.",
  "ideal_environment": "A Maltese dog would love to live in an apartment, but they’d also love a larger home. The most important thing in their environment is you.\n\nThese pups are deeply attached to their people, so they do best when someone is with them for most of the day. If you will be away for long, check them into doggy daycare or have a friend or professional dog sitter drop by to play with them.\n\nIt’s important to note that a Maltese might be startled by everyday noises if you are away. So if you live in an apartment with close neighbors, you may need to work with a trainer to curb their barking. A white noise machine can also distract them from outside noises.\n\nA Maltese won’t be scared to share you, and they’ll likely be delighted to have siblings. They usually get along great with other pets as well as kids, making them great family dogs. But with bigger dogs or young children, always supervise interactions to make sure the Maltese doesn’t feel overwhelmed by these larger creatures.",
  "health_description": "A Maltese lifespan is 12–15 years. Here are some potential health issues to be aware of.\r\n\n\t• Acquired tremors syndrome: Also known as shaker syndrome, this condition affects mostly small white dog breeds (though small dogs with other coat colors can have it, too). Dogs with this syndrome may have mild tremors in one body part or more severe tremors all over that make it difficult for them to walk. This condition is usually treated with prednisone.\nCataracts: Cataracts aren’t usually painful, but they can cause cloudy eyes and vision loss, so get a yearly eye test to catch them early. Surgery is the go-to treatment. \nEpiphora: Epiphora is another name for watery eyes, and it contributes to tear stains. Most tear staining isn’t a cause for concern, but if your pup is tearing up more than normal, it could be the result of an underlying health condition like allergies, corneal ulcers, dry eye syndrome, or another eye disease. Contact your vet if you think something may be up.\nGlaucoma: Glaucoma occurs when fluid in the eyes doesn’t drain and pressure builds. It’s painful and can result in blindness, so it’s a medical emergency. Treatment is topical medications or surgery.  \nGranulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME): GME is a complex condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. While there is no cure, the condition is often treated for life with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs.\nHypoglycemia: Low blood sugar is common in Maltese dogs. Feed your dog on a regular schedule to prevent hypoglycemia; your vet can give you advice.\nLuxating patella: Maltese can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can help prevent this condition.\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA): PDA is a congenital heart defect in dogs. It’s when a blood vessel near the heart doesn’t completely close after birth, and it can lead to heart failure. It can often be corrected with surgery.\nPortosystemic shunt: Also called a liver or hepatic shunt, a portosystemic shunt is when blood vessels circumvent the liver, preventing it from clearing the blood of toxins. Surgery is often the best treatment.\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA leads to blindness in dogs, and while there is no cure, pups who lose their eyesight tend to adapt well and can still live full, happy lives.\nTracheal collapse: Tracheal collapse happens when a dog’s windpipe flattens. It makes it hard to get air into the lungs, and as a result many dogs may make a dry, goose-like honking cough. Pups with this condition should have their leash attached to a harness, not a collar (which can push on the trachea), and treatment may include weight management, medications, or surgery.",
  "history_description": "The Maltese has a long history as a beloved lapdog, and they take their name from the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFrom 1500 B.C.E., Malta was conquered by different empires for two millennia, and it’s thought that Phoenicians (who were around before the rise of Greece) introduced them to the island.\n\nThe dogs were well-loved in Greek culture in the 4th and 5th centuries; they were depicted in art and praised by Aristotle for their symmetry. They were a status symbol for ancient Romans, and there is even a legend that Saint Paul was given a Maltese after he was shipwrecked on Malta.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire collapsed and ushered Europe into the Dark Ages, the Maltese breed thrived in China, where the dogs were crossed with native breeds; later, they became popular again in Europe and were owned by nobility, notably Mary, Queen of Scots and Marie Antoinette.\n\nA Maltese puppy can cost as much as $4,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder.\n\nYou can also look for Maltese dogs for adoption. Seek out a local Maltese rescue like the American Maltese Rescue Association, keep an eye out at your local shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are Maltese hypoallergenic? Do Maltese shed?",
      "answer": "Maltese are considered hypoallergenic dogs because they don’t have an undercoat and are very low shedders. Brushing your pup will keep those flyaway hairs at bay and allergy triggers to a minimum. However, no dog is 100% hypoallergenic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Maltese bark a lot?",
      "answer": "It depends on the individual dog, but some Maltese may bark, especially if they are fearful or experience separation anxiety when away from their family. Work with a certified, positive-reinforcement trainer to pinpoint the cause of the barking and resolve it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Maltese good with kids?",
      "answer": "Yes, Maltese can be great with kids when properly socialized. The biggest issue with children is that Maltese can be fragile because they are so small. You’ll need to supervise these dogs around smaller kiddos so they aren’t injured by rough play."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Maltese dogs swim?",
      "answer": "Maltese can swim, but they’re not as talented as dogs who were bred to work in water, like Golden Retrievers. Their long hair can weigh them down, kind of like if you were to swim in jeans. Always make sure they’re wearing a doggy life jacket when they’re near water."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy a teacup Maltese or miniature Maltese?",
      "answer": "No. Maltese are already very tiny dogs, and breeding them to be even smaller isn’t healthy. Do not work with any breeder who claims to sell a teacup Maltese dog or a mini Maltese."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a Maltese have black fur?",
      "answer": "Nope. If you’ve come across a black Maltese, you’ve got an adorable pup who’s most likely a Maltipoo (Maltese–Poodle mix) or a Maltipom (Maltese–Pomeranian mix)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Maltese live?",
      "answer": "The life expectancy of a Maltese is a lengthy 12–15 years."
