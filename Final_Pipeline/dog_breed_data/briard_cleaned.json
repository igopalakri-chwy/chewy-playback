  "breed_intro": "With peek-a-boo bangs and the grace and confidence of a supermodel, the Briard breed turns heads. But don't be fooled: This breed isn't satisfied with being just a pretty face. Highly intelligent and energetic, a Briard is as driven to excel as the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. The difference? Their No. 1 job is being your faithful companion. Briards are happiest when they have a prominent seat on the board of your family—perhaps as a supervisor of children, their favorite humans—and a daily run where they pick the route and set the pace. Let them think they're the boss (hey, maybe they are), and they're yours forever.",
  "appearance_description": "With their long and slightly wavy hair that often covers their curious eyes, a Briard's physical traits are unmistakable. Behind that signature fringe and just above their large button nose, their large, dark eyes are watching out for you. And, oh, that hair! Whether you're brushing them or watching it flow as they fetch a ball, you'll be mesmerized by how it gives this breed their elegance.",
  "temperament_description": "\"A heart wrapped in fur\": That's how many fans of this breed would describe Briards. They are affectionate, bond deeply with their people and make great family dogs. In fact, Briards get along especially well with kids. Fiercely loyal to their family, the breed sees kids as part of their flock and may devote themselves to their safety and ensuring their needs are met.\r\n\r\nWhile American Kennel Club (AKC) classifies Briards in the Herding group because they were originally bred to herd livestock, Briards don't have a strong prey drive, and they're able to bond well with other animals, too. They will, however, nip at ankles when they want you or children somewhere else. You can help curb this type of behavior with proper training and ensuring they get enough exercise every day.\r\n\r\nBriards love nothing more than having a job to do, whether that's fetching a ball, working through a puzzle or running an agility course. But their most important job (at least in their minds) is guarding their family, and they take their work seriously. That means you'll need to be cautious around strangers. No, Briards won't bite your boss the first time they come over for dinner, but they're certainly not going to offer them a handshake, either. And if you're throwing a dinner party, and your guests have the audacity to mingle in different rooms, don't be surprised if your Briard tries to herd everyone back together.\r\n\r\nBriards are smart dogs who need regular exercise to keep them in top form mentally and physically. Without it, they'll look for other ways to work through their inquisitive, intelligent and high-energy nature, even if that means destructive behaviors like chewing, digging or chasing.",
  "care_description": "The sheer, impressive size of a Briard is a great visual reminder of the amount of time and energy that goes into parenting the breed. In this case, \"large dog\" equals \"large amounts of care,\" from daily grooming to a rigorous exercise schedule. But every second you spend on your Briard will be paid back in unwavering devotion (and unchewed shoes).",
  "grooming_description": "Can you do one more head of hair in the morning? If you're considering bringing a Briard into your life, that's an serious question. Their grooming is more extensive than other breeds, and includes daily brushing and regular visits with their hairstylist (aka an experienced groomer). Every four to six weeks is recommended to maintain their gorgeous locks. Here are some grooming tips for your Briard:\n\n \t• Brushing: For your daily at-home hair sessions, use a quality pin brush, then follow with an undercoat rake to prevent mats and to keep their hair healthy. Briards shed less than you might expect given the style of their coat, but you can further minimize loose hair around your home and in your car with these grooming tools.\nBathing: If you bathe your pup at home, plan on bathing them once every four to six weeks. (Depending on their activity level, you may be able to go longer.) You don't want to give your Briard too many baths; it'll strip the coat of the natural oils that keep it healthy.\nDental care: After taking care of all that hair, don't forget to brush their teeth daily, starting when they are a puppy to get them used to the feeling. Take them in for a professional dental exam and cleaning by your vet once a year, too.\nNail trimming: Check their nails every two weeks for a trim. Briards have dewclaws, which are loosely attached claws that sit a short distance up their leg from their paws, so don't forget to check those extra toes!\n\nThat may seem like a lot of grooming, but there is one way you can make it easier: Start them young. Practicing brushing their hair and teeth and clipping their nails when they're puppies helps them get comfortable with having you up in their business. And that makes the process go a lot more smoothly for you both.",
  "training_description": "Proper training is the key to a healthy relationship with your Briard puppy. Because they were bred to herd and protect, Briards can quickly become destructive without adequate mental enrichment such as a vigorous game of tag with you or a search-and-rescue mission for their treats. That's bad news for your footwear, furniture and other potential chewables.\n\nBut here's the good news: Their smarts make training them a lot of fun. Briards are phenomenal trick dogs and excel in dog sports, like agility competitions. They welcome the opportunity to work their biggest muscle—their brains. Group training or reserving time for them on a herding farm where they can get lots of exercise would be beneficial. As with other dogs, positive reinforcement training (aka offering rewards like treats, toys and praise) is a must when training your Briard, whether they're a puppy or fully grown. Their keen minds will welcome all positive vibes and gifts for a job well done from their cherished pet parents.\n\nSocialization is an important part of your Briard's training. Getting your dog used to new people, other dogs and experiences will help them be OK with social situations as they're older. If you're adopting a puppy, look into puppy schools in your area. These classes get them interacting with other puppies (so they learn how to play nicely with each other), and they are introduced to other pup parents, so they learn people are OK, too.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Briard breed typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Look for a statement on the packaging that indicates that the food meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and be sure to choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Work closely with your veterinarian to determine portion size to decrease the likelihood of obesity. Extra pounds on a Briard can stress joints or cause back pain and increase their likelihood of health problems, like heart disease, or digestive disorders.\r\n\r\nSome Briards can easily pack on the pounds, so food and treat maintenance is key. A good way to keep yourself from over-treating your Briard is to give yourself a treat every time you refuse to let them herd you to the treat cabinet. Positive reinforcement works on humans, too! But if that doesn't work, your vet is in the best position to help you balance mealtime and snack time to help keep your Briard at a healthy weight.",
  "exercise_description": "Briards have a high energy level, so they need to work, jump, play and otherwise be kept busy. At least one hour a day needs to be devoted to helping them get their daily exercise, and mixing it up keeps both of you from getting bored. One day it might be a romp in the backyard. The next day it could be a run around the park. On the weekend, it could be an agility class, followed the next day with a shift on a working sheep farm. It's all action with these lovable dogs in your life.\r\n\r\nTheir exercise needs to go beyond just the physical, too. These highly intelligent dogs were bred to use their brains. Having problem-solving games around the house ready for them to tackle helps keep their mind engaged, supplementing all the exercise you'll be giving their body.",
  "ideal_environment": "The best environment for a Briard is with family. They do well in homes with kids and other pets, especially those with a large, fenced-in backyard with room to run ... and run ... and run some more. Apartment and city living is possible if you're able to provide the exercise and activity they need, but it's not an ideal environment for a Briard. They need space for their voracious appetite for life.\r\n\r\nAn active family who enjoys training and working with their dog in their free time will do well with a Briard, but this dog may not be a social butterfly at the dog park or next brewery opening. Remember: This dog is thinking about their family—and keeping them safe—all. The. Time. In unfamiliar, crowded environments, there can be too many unknowns for a Briard's liking. They prefer to know the intricacies of their surroundings, so they can keep their flock safe.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of their flock, pet parents who have experience with working breeds are a Briard's ideal family. Briards are independent thinkers, and an experienced pet parent understands that patience and consistency are non-negotiables. (There are no days off—ever.) But if a prospective first-time pet parent has their heart set on a Briard, it's highly recommended that they start with an adult Briard who is already socially mature. Often, an adult pup is already well-trained and socialized, so they're used to other people and know how to be a well-behaved member of the family.",
  "health_description": "A Briard’s lifespan is, on average, 12 years; but they do have some health problems to look out for. To help keep your Briard in good health for longer, keep an eye out for these common health issues. \r\n\n \t• Congenital Stationary Night Blindness: This inherited eye disease causes the progressive degeneration of the retina, leading to vision loss. Currently, there is no treatment, but this condition isn’t painful for your pup. To accommodate Briards with this eye disease, keep lights on at night and do not rearrange furniture or make other significant changes to the home; this will help prevent them from running into things they cannot see. There is a genetic screening test available.  \r\n \t• Other Eye issues: Briards are prone to other eye conditions, including cataracts, corneal dystrophy and progressive retinal atrophy. If you suspect your pet is having trouble with their vision, please see your veterinarian right away.   \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia can have a genetic component and occurs when the ball and socket joint of the hip does not form properly and, therefore, does not fit well together. This results in laxity in the joint, causing lameness, pain and arthritis. Treatment options typically range from medication to surgery.   \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Briards are prone to decreased thyroid hormone levels, which can result in weight gain, lethargy and hair loss. This can be diagnosed with a blood test and is typically treated with daily medication. \r\n \t• Exocrine Pancreatitis Insufficiency (EPI): A health condition that can be inherited in Briards, EPI is when the body does not produce sufficient pancreatic enzymes to digest fats, carbohydrates and proteins. This leads to poor absorption of nutrients, resulting in dogs losing weight even when they’re eating well. Blood tests can help diagnose EPI, and treatment is typically supplementation of pancreatic enzymes.  \r\n\nTo avoid these conditions, potential Briard parents should meet with breeders first to discuss any known conditions found in the breed line. If the pet is already home, a veterinary ophthalmologist can perform an eye screening exam to rule out any potential eye issues.",
  "history_description": "Pop quiz! Which of the world's most popular cheeses is the Briard named after? If you guessed Brie, then you're right—well, sort of. (It was a bit of a trick question.) The Briard isn't named after the cheese itself, but they're named after the dairy belt region in northern France known for producing the rich, buttery cheese.\r\n\r\nThis breed has been cherished by the French for centuries. Briards were depicted in tapestries from the 8th century with Emperor Charlemagne. Charles the Great, as he's also called, was also good at bringing things together. He “herded\" western and central Europe together in the Middle Ages. This might be what drew him to the Briard.\r\n\r\nDue to their confidence and athletic and agile nature, these dogs were bred by French farmers for herding and guarding sheep. They eventually used those same skill sets to aid the French army as its official war dog during World War I. They took supplies to the front lines, worked as guard dogs and helped locate wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis popular French breed first came to notice in America when future President Thomas Jefferson was the ambassador to France. When his tenure ended, he left with a pregnant Briard named Bergère. She and her pups worked Jefferson's land and to this day are believed to be some of the first Briard dogs to enter the United States. (Others were brought by his friend, Marquis de Lafayette.) The AKC recognized the breed in 1928 as its 81st breed.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Briard to your family? Briard puppies can be found through reputable breeders listed by the AKC. The average cost for a puppy is $1,500. But for that price, you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You may also seek out local Briard rescue organizations to find a dog to adopt or search for Briards at your local animal shelter.  You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
