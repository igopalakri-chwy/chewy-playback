  "breed_intro": "Enjoy living life to the fullest? The spirited and brave Border Terrier can—and will!—match your energy step for step. Don't let their small size fool you. These tough little dogs know how to stand up for themselves and aren't afraid to let everyone know it. They are independent and feisty, but once they've bonded with their pet parent, you'll have a loyal friend for life. Small enough to come everywhere with you and sassy enough to cope with whatever life throws their way, one thing's for sure: Life with a Border Terrier will never, ever be dull.",
  "appearance_description": "The Border Terrier breed has an otter-like head, with dark, moderate-sized eyes, small, V-shaped ears and a short, well-filled muzzle. They're alert and expressive face hints at their bold and intelligent personalities. Their bodies are solid yet narrow, and their wiry and waterproof coat is designed to protect them perfectly from the elements. Their coat colors include red, wheaten, blue and tan, and grizzle (a mix of black with gray and tan) and tan. They almost always have black points on the muzzle and ears.",
  "temperament_description": "If your to-do list is a mile long, and there is nothing you love more than a day spent checking things off it, then you've got a kindred spirit in the Border Terrier. If the Border Terrier had a theme song, it would be Flight of the Bumble Bees—they are busy, busy, busy, love to be on the go, and have a strong work ethic. Their affectionate and happy-go-lucky personality is infectious, though they like their independence—which is what makes them a terrier after all!\r\n\r\nThese medium-height and active little dogs need plenty of engagement and interaction with their humans. A Border Terrier 101 rule is never to let your dog get bored (and maybe you can relate). If they do, they'll put their intelligent brains to use, typically in undesired behaviors. They may think it's entertaining to dig up your lawn or terrorize the local wildlife, but unless you're planning a backyard reno and are thankful to save on some demo costs, you may not feel the same.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers are affectionate but aren't overly needy. They love to be involved with what you're doing but aren't as much of a \"Velcro breed\" as some other dogs. These outgoing and confident dogs also enjoy meeting new people, so don't be alarmed if you pick up some new friends while you're out and about.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can live alongside other dogs very happily, especially if their pup pals are playful, too. They can live with cats but will need to be introduced carefully. Border Terriers are an excellent choice for families with older kids, as they're robust and fairly energetic. You might find the kids are great at wearing your dog out as they speed around together.\r\n\r\nWhile this breed was originally a working dog (dogs meant for guarding, pulling sleds or carts or catching vermin), they're more often kept as family pets these days. They still love the opportunity to learn new skills and excel at activities like earthdog, flyball and anything else that combines physical and mental work.",
  "care_description": "A Border Terriers are a hardy breed that requires low to moderate amount of care, including all the basics like regular grooming, a healthy diet, daily exercise and training. In return, they make affectionate companions.",
  "grooming_description": "Overall, Border Terriers are low-shedding dogs, and for most of the year, your Border Terrier will only need their coat brushed once a week. A combo brush—where one side is a pin brush, and the other side is bristles—is your best bet, as you can use the pin brush side to detangle before smoothing those stray long hairs back into place. \n\nIt's a good idea to get into the habit of checking your dog's nails every time you give them a brush, and you can then clip these as needed, typically about once every two weeks.\n\nDuring shedding seasons, typically spring and fall, however, plan on spending some extra bonding time with your pup for grooming. Border Terriers should be hand stripped—the process of removing dead hairs from the wiry topcoat—every day during shedding season, which can take about 30 minutes. You can also use a stripping tool or book your dog into the groomer for a pamper session.\n\nThe Border Terrier's wiry coat rarely needs bathing, which can strip the oils that help provide the coat's distinctive weatherproof quality. If your dog is particularly active and loves getting dirty, you may need to bathe them more often, but rarely more than once a month.\n\nDental health is essential for your Border Terrier to help prevent gum disease and other health problems. Start brushing your dog's teeth twice a week when they're puppies to get them used to the feeling and work up to daily brushings. Bear in mind your pup will still need an annual professional teeth cleaning session from your vet.",
  "training_description": "Border Terrier training is usually rewarding and fun—these little dogs are enthusiastic and motivated to learn. Typical Border Terrier qualities include an outgoing and playful attitude that makes them keen and quick to learn new commands. Combined with their independent streak, this can make training both endearing and challenging, but consistent, positive reinforcement (aka rewarding good behavior with treats, praise or playtime) will help build confidence in your Border Terrier and help them be their best selves.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers are intelligent and fearless, and socialization as a puppy is an essential part of their training. Border Terriers aren't as biddable as some other breeds, like Golden Retrievers, so it's important to know how to balance their independent-yet-sensitive nature to get the best out of your training sessions.\r\n\r\nA strong hunting instinct is a fact of life when living with a Border Terrier dog. Some types will have a less pronounced prey drive, but pet parents always need to bear this trait in mind. Few Borders can resist the thrill of the chase when wildlife saunters by, so a securely fenced training area is an absolute must.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Border Terriers typically thrive on high-quality commercial dog food. When choosing the best food for a Border Terrier, remember to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula to suit their specific life stage (puppy, adult, senior).\n\nSome Border Terriers can suffer from allergies or gluten sensitivities, in which case you may choose to feed a limited ingredient diet, but check with your vet first. Table scraps are a bad idea for Border Terriers, as they're often high in fat, and some human foods are dangerous to dogs.\n\nDue to their small size, you'll need to keep an eye on their portions so that they don't gain too much weight. You may want to choose low-calorie treats and account for these in their daily caloric intake when working out how much to feed your dog every day.\n\nAlways consult your veterinarian when considering your dog's diet. They can help you determine the best food combinations to keep your dog as healthy as possible.",
  "exercise_description": "Border Terriers never sit still for long and need a decent of exercise and activity to keep them content. This playful and intelligent breed adores the physical and mental challenge of high-energy dog sports like searching games, fetch and earthdog. (Earthdog tests a dog's ability to chase and catch critters underground. But no worries; the critters are safely contained and unharmed.) An hour of daily exercise that includes brisk walks and plenty of playtime will help your Border Terrier use up all that bounce.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can live in small homes as long as they spend enough time being active. Food puzzles and hide-and-seek toys are a great way to keep your pup's bright mind occupied at home. When choosing toys, be sure to select tough and durable options that can stand up to the Border Terrier's enthusiastic attention. They have an instinct to grab and shake whatever they've \"caught.\" \r\n\r\nWith even the best-trained Border Terrier, it's advisable to keep this dog breed on a leash when you're out and about, as they sometimes can't resist the urge to chase small animals. These little guys are also escape artists, so pet parents need to consider extending fencing underground for at least 18 inches to corral their antics.",
  "ideal_environment": "One of the classic Border Terrier traits is adaptability. That means they can suit a wide range of homes, whether that's a small city apartment or a rural farm. The key is that wherever they live, they still need physical and mental exercise and a well-fenced outdoor area. Border Terriers can be a good choice for new pet parents as long as you're willing to put in the hours needed to keep them entertained and exercised.\r\n\r\nIn terms of other pets, they can live with cats if you introduce them carefully. Even then, you should always supervise Border Terriers when they're with cats they don't know. They're not the best match for homes with small pets like hamsters or gerbils either, as their high prey drive means they will instinctively want to hunt or chase these.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can get along great with kids, but because they're so enthusiastic and generally bouncy, be sure to supervise them when younger ones are around.",
  "health_description": "Border Terriers are generally a healthy breed, with a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years. They can suffer from some health problems, and it's worth familiarizing yourself with any health issues so you can keep your dog happy and healthy for as long as possible.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited and degenerative condition where the hip joint is malformed and causes lameness and pain. While there aren't genetic screen tests available, affected dogs shouldn't be bred. Treatment options include joint supplements, pain medications, and, in severe cases, surgery.\nLuxating Patella: This affects many small breed dogs and happens when their kneecap (patella) slips out of place and causes intermittent lameness. Ask your veterinarian for information if you think your dog is affected, as sometimes surgery is recommended.\nPeriodontal Disease: Dental disease is one of the most common health issues in all dog breeds, but the effects can be exaggerated in small breeds like Border Terriers. Getting into a routine of daily teeth brushing along with an annual dental exam will help keep your dog's teeth clean and their gums healthy.\nHeart Conditions: Border Terriers can suffer from heart conditions, which can occur early in life as congenital defects or later in life as weakening of the valves of the heart. A veterinarian should screen new puppies for murmurs and conduct annual examinations to check for the development of a heart murmur over their lifetime.\nSpongiform Leukoencephalomyelopathy (SLEM): Also known as \"shaking puppy syndrome,\" this is a hereditary but rare condition that causes uncontrollable shaking, usually of the hind legs. Reputable breeders should test parent dogs and provide a copy of the results so you know your puppy will not inherit SLEM.\nGluten Sensitivity: Border Terriers can occasionally suffer from paroxysmal gluten-sensitive dyskinesia (PGSD), sometimes called canine epileptoid cramping syndrome. It can cause a range of symptoms, including involuntary movement, collapse and gastrointestinal discomfort. Your vet can help diagnose this, and moving to a gluten-free diet can help lessen or even resolve the symptoms.\nEye Problems: Border Terriers can suffer from eye problems, including progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and juvenile cataracts. Responsible breeders will screen for PRA and should provide results for parent dogs. It's also thought that juvenile cataracts could be inherited, and some breeders may test for this condition, too.\nCushing's Disease: Border Terriers are at higher risk for developing Cushing's, an endocrine disease where the body produces too much of the natural steroid (cortisol). Blood tests are used to diagnose, and typically, treatment is daily medication.",
  "history_description": "This plucky little terrier hails from the border between England and Scotland. Their original purpose was to protect herds of sheep (and their lambs) from the local fox population. Because of the Border Terrier's mixed origins, they've had a few different names, including Ullswater Terrier, Reedwater Terrier, and Coquetdale Terrier. These all referenced landmarks around the border country this breed calls home. By the 1800s, the breed became known as the Border Terrier thanks to its link to the Border Hunt based in Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThese brave dogs were famed for their \"hard as nails\" attitude, outgoing personalities and enthusiastic pursuit of their prey. These are traits the modern breed is still famed for today, although these days, the breed is more popular as a family pet than a working dog.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Border Terrier in 1930, and the Border Terrier Club of America was formed in 1949. However, the breed is still relatively rare in the USA.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering where to find a Border Terrier puppy, then the American Kennel Club's list of reputable breeders is the best place to start. In terms of the average Border Terrier price, you should budget around $2,000. For that price, you should get a puppy from a registered and reputable breeder who carries out all the appropriate health and temperament checks. You may also find a Border Terrier at local rescue organizations or animal shelters, so it's always worth contacting those if you're considering rehoming an older Border Terrier dog. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
