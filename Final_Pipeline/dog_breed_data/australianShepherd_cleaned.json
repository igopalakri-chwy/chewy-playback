  "breed_intro": "If you lead an active lifestyle, the energetic Australian Shepherd breed might just be your ideal canine companion. As the jock of the dog park, an Aussie dog is always up for hiking, Frisbee and fetch. They're competitive; excelling at tricks and stunts and in agility trials. Together, you two could take on the world'¦ or at least conquer your next workout, yoga or SUP session.",
  "appearance_description": "The Australian Shepherd has a striking appearance, characterized by a shrewd gaze, a fluffy double coat that covers a lean body, and a bobbed or docked tail. Although Australian Shepherds can have eyes of any color, they are often recognized for their expressive, occasionally mismatched, light blue eyes. The Aussie's coat color can vary greatly. It's worth noting that there is no recognized \"mini\" version of the Australian Shepherd as an American Kennel Club (AKC) breed. However, there is a separate breed called the Miniature American Shepherd, which is a smaller version with its own distinct breed standard. It is important to avoid crossing these two breeds if you want a dog that can be registered with the AKC.",
  "temperament_description": "Australian Shepherds embody what they were bred to do: herd. They are fast, smart and always on the move. As such, providing training and outlets for all their energy are a must.\n\nBecause they have a natural herding instinct, Aussies may try to round up unsuspecting children or neighbors on a bike ride. For this reason, it's crucial to train your Aussie early so they understand how to behave and what's expected of them. Be sure your pup is well-trained before they go off-leash, too, because Aussies are known for their speed.\n\nCultivate their natural curiosity by implementing daily training sessions that engage their mind and their bodies. They want to please you, and daily training sessions will deepen your bond.\n\nPlaytime is another way to engage Aussies'and blow off some of that energy! Just about any game you invent will be enthusiastically enjoyed by your pup. Most Aussies adore fetching and can have impressive skills; they have a well-deserved reputation as disc dog champions. Throw a Frisbee for your pet at the park and onlookers are sure to be amazed at what your Aussie can do.\n\nWhile your Aussie's exuberant personality might make you think they are incredibly social, they tend to be cautious around strangers. Proper socialization when your Australian Shepherd is a puppy will help them feel comfortable in new environments with unknown people.\n\nBottom line: Aussies dislike downtime (except when they're sleeping!), so keep them engaged with lots of outside time and toys, such as interactive chew toys, flying discs and balls.",
  "care_description": "Hearty dogs bred for life on the farm or ranch, Aussies are relatively rough-and-tumble dogs who need outlets for their high energy, sharp minds and desire to work. A healthy Aussie is an active Aussie, so make sure to keep them active no matter the weather or your schedule.",
  "grooming_description": "Do Australian Shepherds shed? Yes! As double-coated dogs (meaning they have longer guard hairs on top of a softer undercoat), it's important to use brushing tools that can reach the undercoat. To help reduce shedding, use a slicker brush in the direction of the fur, followed gently by an undercoat rake. A thorough, weekly brushing will help distribute the natural oils and keep their coat glossy from nose to tail.\n\nHere are a few more tips for grooming your Australian Shepherd:\n\n \tBathing: Australian Shepherds are blessed with a coat that's equipped to handle many weather conditions. Bathing them too often can strip the natural oils that keep their skin healthy. Aussies only need a bath about once every 6-8 weeks unless they are especially dirty from one of their outdoor adventures. Pro tip: Leave a dog towel by the door to rub them down when they come inside the house after a romp outside, and pay special attention to their paws, which can get roughed up from off-road adventuring. Have a dog paw cleaner handy, too.\n \tDental care: Brush your dog's teeth every day to keep them healthy and to prevent dental disease. Start brushing your dog's teeth as a puppy so they're used to the feeling. Once a year, take them to the vet for a professional cleaning.\n \tNail trimming: Because the Aussie is an active dog, their nails may not need trimming as frequently as a more sedentary dog. You'll know it's time for a pedi when you hear them clicking on hard surfaces. Here's how to trim a dog's nails.",
  "training_description": "Training your Aussie is the best thing you can do for both you and your pup. An Aussie's instinct is to work, and they may need some help defining what 'work' means when there are no cows to herd. Luckily, they're highly intelligent and easy to train.\n\nTraining should begin when they're about 4 months old. Consider enrolling in puppy obedience school where you can learn together. You will learn basic commands like stay and come, and it's a great way to socialize your dog with strangers and other pups. Whether you train your pup yourself or work with a professional, provide lots of positive reinforcement, rewarding a job well done with treats, special toys and praise.\n\nAfter your Aussie has the basics down, keep them engaged by teaching them more complex tricks and competitive sports, such as agility, dock diving and flyball, which can help them channel their energy and intelligence.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Aussie dogs are highly active, so they may need more calories than couch potato pups. It's important to feed them dog food that meets the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutritional standards to ensure they receive a complete and balanced diet. If you want to whip up your pup's meals from scratch, consult with your vet first. Be sure your pup receives adequate nutrition to support their extensive energy levels.\n\nSome Aussies may have food allergies that manifest as itchy, dry skin. Pay attention to any symptoms and bring them up at your vet visit. Your vet may recommend hypoallergenic foods or foods formulated for sensitive skin for your dog.\n\nNow, let's talk treats: Treats are important for training. Because you'll train your Australian Shepherd puppy often, you'll use lots of goodies, right? Not so fast'Aussies need the majority of their calories to come from mealtimes, not less-nutritious treats. And even active dogs can become obese if they take in more calories than they burn. A chat with your vet will help you dial in a healthy ratio.",
  "exercise_description": "It cannot be stated enough: An active Aussie is a happy Aussie. Because Australian Shepherds have abundant energy, pet parents must keep them moving. If you don't provide avenues for your Aussie to burn energy, they'll create their own'and their ways won't please you.\r\n\r\nWhile some Aussies love being part of a pack of dogs at doggy daycare, Aussies love the company of their human family. They need plenty of time to run, walk, play off leash and train with you. Aim to engage with your dog for at least an hour or two every day. Aussies also love long hikes and outdoor adventures.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the Australian Shepherd breed thrives when engaging with competitive dog sports, especially agility trials and canine disc sports.",
  "ideal_environment": "An Aussie will be happy anywhere they have access to the outdoors. A large backyard is ideal, but an Aussie can adapt to apartment living as long as they have ample access to a nearby park and pet parents with enough time to play with them every day.\r\n\r\nAn Aussie can be an excellent dog for a single person or a family. While they enjoy the excitement and activity a family can bring, they may try to herd toddlers and other pets. They thrive in homes with responsible older kids who can match their energy levels.\r\n\r\nAustralian Shepherds need a confident pup parent, because they will take on the role of leader if you don't. For that reason, they're usually better suited for someone with previous experience with dogs. But, if you're a first-time pup parent willing to invest the time and energy your pup needs, you will have a fantastic companion for life's adventures.",
  "health_description": "The Australian Shepherd breed has a lifespan of about 12-15 years and is generally hearty. Presently, the breed has a long life expectancy'it's not unusual for an Aussie to live to 16 years old. However, there are a few health issues to be aware of: \r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a painful genetic condition in which the ball of the femur doesn't properly fit into the hip socket. Environmental factors, such as obesity, can exacerbate symptoms, which means a healthy diet and regular exercise routine are crucial for Aussies. Vets can manage hip dysplasia in Aussies with physical therapy and medication; in some cases, they may need to do surgery. \r\n \tEye Problems: Cataracts are the most common eye disease in Aussies. Aussies are also at risk of other eye defects, including Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA), a hereditary disease of the nerve and eye tissue that ultimately leads to blindness. Although surgery can treat cataracts, it won't help with CEA. Aussies are also susceptible to distichiasis, a condition in which an eyelash grows abnormally, potentially scratching the eye. Depending on the severity, treatments range from an eye lubricant to surgery. Finally, iris coloboma is a condition seen in Aussies where the iris (colored part of the eye) does not develop properly and can lead to light sensitivity and discomfort. If you notice anything unusual about your Aussie's eyes, bring it to your vet's attention. \r\n \tCancerous Tumors: Aussies have an increased risk of some cancers, particularly lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma (cancer from the cells that line blood vessels). Let your vet know if you notice any unusual growths, but remember some growths can be internal. Some growths are noncancerous (benign), but others are cancerous. Treatment options can include surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Usually, the quicker the diagnosis, the more treatment options. \r\n \tEpilepsy: Epilepsy or seizures can be an inherited condition in Aussies. There are no genetic screening tests for epilepsy, but often the condition can be well controlled with daily, lifelong medication. If you have any concerns that your pet may be having a seizures, please see your vet immediately.   \r\n \tMultidrug Resistance Mutation (MDR1): MDR1 is a genetic mutation commonly found in herding breeds including Aussies. This mutation makes dogs more sensitive to some medications, particularly Ivermectin, which is found in many heartworm prevention medications. There is genetic testing, which can detect if your dog has this mutation. While most commercially available heartworm prevention medications are still safe for dogs with MDR1 mutation when used as prescribed, it is always important to consult your veterinarian on the right medication for your pet.  \r\n\r\nLike with any pet, take your dog in for regular check-ups so you and your vet understand your Aussie's healthy \"normal.\" This can help you better identify when your Aussie behaves atypically. Small changes, such as lethargy, lack of interest in food or water or urinating or pooping more or less frequently, may be a sign of a larger issue, so get changes checked right away.",
  "history_description": "A misconception about the Australian Shepherd's origin is that they hail from Australia. Believe it or not, the Aussie's story begins not in Australia but in the Basque region of Spain, near the Pyrenees mountains that border Spain and France. Here, herdsmen selectively bred the ancestors of the beloved Aussie for their herding abilities.\r\n\r\nAs people from the Basque region settled in Australia during the 19th century, they brought these working dogs with them. Over time, these dogs were bred with other herding dogs, like Border Collies, and found homes on Australian ranches.\r\n\r\nAs migration progressed from Australia to the American West, Australian Shepherds found footing in California, where the locals mistakenly assumed Australia was the dogs' place of origin. California ranchers admired these dogs for their work ethic and exceptional herding abilities. As a result, they became valued for their abilities in the rodeo adding \"rodeo performer\" to their resumÃ©.\r\n\r\nThe AKC added Australian Shepherds to the Herding group in 1993. Today, they are still regularly found on ranches and farms worldwide. Not only are they great additions to high-energy families, but Aussies can also be found working as service or therapy dogs and in jobs like search and rescue.\r\n\r\nIt's commonly thought there are two types of Aussies: the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Australian Shepherd. During the 1960s in California, breeders developed the Miniature Australian Shepherd by breeding to create a smaller body size while retaining the intelligence and activity level of the Aussie. But the dogs they used were unregistered, so their exact lineage isn't clear. Today these diminutive dogs are known as the Miniature American Shepherd and entered the AKC Stud Book in 2015.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add an Australian Shepherd to your family? An Australian Shepherd can cost anywhere from $600-$2,000-plus for a purebred puppy. Be sure to do your homework on how to acquire a healthy puppy: Ask to see the parents and be sure that a breeders' stock has health clearances for hips, elbows and eyes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to adopt, reach out to Australian Shepherd organizations, such as Aussie Rescue and Placement Helpline (ARPH), a nationwide network of Australian Shepherd rescues, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area. With any rescue, you want to know what you are adopting: Look for a health status and temperament evaluation. As with all dogs, it's essential to factor in veterinarian care, training, food and pet sitting into your budget, as well as the initial cost.",

      "question": "Are Australian Shepherds good with kids?",
      "answer": "Australian Shepherds are good with kids, especially older ones. Aussies look for things to herd and will lean into their herding instincts when small kids and babies are around.

      "question": "Do Australian Shepherds have tails?",
      "answer": "Australian Shepherds have tails, and there's a one-in-five chance that an Aussie will have a naturally bobbed tail since they were bred that way for effective herding. If an Aussie is born with a long tail, the breeder will often dock it to protect it from injury and maintain the look of the breed.\r\n\r\nThe AKC breed standard allows for their tail to be docked straight, docked or naturally bobbed. Docking involves cutting a portion of the dog's tail off when they are puppies. Many countries and states have banned it for medical and behavioral reasons, and some veterinary groups oppose it."
