  "breed_intro": "Think of a Maltipoo as your own personal furry shadow. This Maltese-Poodle mix loves to be close to you, so expect them to follow you around in search of snuggles and lap time.\n\nBut don’t let a Maltipoo’s puppy dog eyes and coat of curls fool you—these dogs are smart and can be strong-willed, so exercise, mental stimulation, and early and consistent training is important. And while their teddy bear-like coat sheds very little, you’ll need to brush your dog every day and schedule regular trips to the groomer.",
  "appearance_description": "Because Maltipoo dogs are an adorable mix of a Maltese and a Toy Poodle or Miniature Poodle, their size and appearance can be a bit different from puppy to puppy.",
  "temperament_description": "These tiny pups are energetic, with no shortage of enthusiasm for playing a game or tussling with a favorite toy. The typical Maltipoo personality is very sweet, loving, and loyal, but they can sometimes be shy, says Sarah Wooten, DVM. But with enough socialization, Maltipoos are social butterflies and affectionate companions with both people and pets, including other dogs and cats.\n\nThe affable Maltipoo temperament makes them perfect playmate for kids. But it’s important that children know how to properly interact with pets and to play gently. Even a full-grown Maltipoo is small and delicate, so the breed isn’t a good fit for rough-and-tumble play.\n\nIt’s important for everyone at home to understand that, despite their too-cute-to-be-real looks, Maltipoo dogs are not toys to be carried and cuddled 24/7. E’Lise Christensen, DVM, DACVB, says to always respect a dog’s need for personal space—including honoring when the dog wants to be touched or not. (Use body language cues to tell when your Maltipoo is in the mood for snuggles.)\n\nAs a companion dog, a Maltipoo bonds tightly with family. As a result, these dogs can experience separation anxiety when left alone. It’s a good idea to teach your Maltipoo puppy to be calm in a crate, which can help them feel safe and happy when you’re away from home. Leaving toys for your pup to play with—like a snuffle mat, a puzzle, or a KONG toy stuffed with goodies—helps, too.",
  "care_description": "The Poodle is a brainy and sporty pup, while the Maltese is known as a friendly lap dog. Put ’em together, and you’ve got a companion that’s always down to be by your side and learn something new.",
  "grooming_description": "For such a tiny dog, a Maltipoo has some big grooming needs. Consistent trips to a professional groomer can take care of some of their needs if you’ve got the budget, but Maltipoos also need daily at-home upkeep.\r\n\n\t• Coat care: Their long, silky locks can grow quite long, so regular haircut appointments (about every six to eight weeks) are a must to manage their coat. At home, brush your dog every day. Some pet parents opt to cut their Maltipoo’s fur short for easier care.\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth every day. Small dogs like the Maltipoo are especially prone to dental disease, and brushing with a dog-safe toothpaste and toothbrush is the best way to keep teeth healthy. (Dental chews and water additives can help, too.)\nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails as needed. If you can hear your Maltipoo’s nails clicking against the kitchen floor, it’s time for a manicure. A groomer can also take care of this task.",
  "training_description": "Although Maltipoos are usually smart dogs—their Poodle parent is often cited as one of the smartest dog breeds—and quick to learn new habits and tricks, they still need consistent and positive training.\n\nPet parents must begin training their Maltipoo puppy as soon as their new furry family member comes home. This goes for socialization, too. It’s only through a pet parent’s guidance that the Maltipoo can reach their full, happy-go-lucky potential.\n\nBe patient with your pup, especially when potty training. Dr. Wooten says Maltipoo puppies can be a bit slow to potty train. Their little bladder makes Maltipoos need to “go” more often than bigger pups, so keep bathroom breaks consistent and frequent.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A high-quality, AAFCO-compliant dog food made for little mouths is perfect for Maltipoos. Chat with your vet for the best guidance and make sure your dog’s food matches their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Keeping scheduled mealtimes is important, too.\n\n“Maltipoo puppies are susceptible to low blood sugar and should be fed every three to four hours through 12–14 weeks of age,” Dr. Wooten says. Adult Maltipoo dogs do well on a less-frequent feeding schedule, at about twice a day.",
  "exercise_description": "Sure, Maltipoos aren’t well-known for their athletic prowess. But they still need exercise and playtime every single day to stay healthy. This is especially important for Maltipoo puppies who have a lot of energy bursting to get out.\n\nTake your dog for at least one walk each day. A Maltipoo’s personality is typically playful and energetic even into their adult years, so these dogs will enjoy playing with interactive toys and puzzles, or engaging in a game of fetch or hide-and-seek. Having fun is a must with this cheerful pup.",
  "ideal_environment": "Whether you live alone or have a big family, a Maltipoo just might be your perfect companion. Their small size and friendly personality also make Maltipoos a good fit for many types of homes, from urban apartments to sprawling acreage. \n\nMaltipoos need love, attention, regular exercise—and a pet parent who doesn’t mind spending time brushing their dog’s fur (and teeth!) every day. They might be a better fit for a family of homebodies, too, since Maltipoos may experience separation anxiety when left alone for too long, too often.\n\nA Maltipoo’s playful energy makes them perfect playmates for kids. But kiddos need to be gentle and know how to play appropriately, under adult supervision. The tiny Maltipoo size makes them highly susceptible to accidental injuries.",
  "health_description": "With proper care, the Maltipoo lifespan often reaches well into the double digits—13–16 years on average. But for this cross between a Poodle and a Maltese, potential health problems include issues common to both breeds, says Dr. Christensen. This includes:\r\n\n\t• Luxating patella: A common issue in small dog breeds, this is when the kneecap shifts out of its normal place. Treatment varies case by case, but severe cases may need surgery.\nDental disease: In the dog world, small mouths can lead to big problems. Dental disease is common in Maltipoos and can lead to tooth loss, bad breath, and even organ damage. Daily toothbrushing and professional cleanings at your vet’s recommendation are the best way to prevent dental problems in your pup.\nTracheal collapse: The trachea is a dog’s windpipe, which carries air from the mouth and nose down to the lungs. When this collapses (a common problem in small dogs like the Maltipoo), it leads to a goose honk–like cough and difficulty breathing. Treatment typically involves medication or, for severe cases, surgery.",
  "history_description": "As a mixed breed, not much is known about the Maltipoo’s history. But the Poodle-Maltese cross has gained popularity in recent decades as pet parents search for low-shedding “hypoallergenic” dog breeds that might not trigger allergic reactions in some people. (Remember: All dogs shed allergens in their saliva and urine, so no pup is 100% hypoallergenic.)\n\nThe Maltipoo’s parent breeds, however, have long and storied histories. Poodles were originally bred in Germany as hunting dogs, while the Maltese is an ancient dog breed from Malta, an island nation in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe average Maltipoo price is difficult to pin down and varies widely, but many Maltipoo puppies cost $1,500 or more, with heftier price tags for unique coat colors. You may also be able to find a Maltipoo for adoption by checking local shelters and rescues.",
