  "breed_intro": "The Japanese Chin doesn't have family—they have servants (namely, you). This little lapdog was bred in the lap of luxury, and they expect you to remember that. A playful breed, the Japanese Chin will join you in singing (they're known for their vocals) and dancing (their signature move is the \"Chin spin\") all night long. And after a TikTok duet with your favorite influencer, they'll be influencing you for a special treat. (And maybe their own TikTok account.)",
  "appearance_description": "From their upturned noses to the plume of their tail, Japanese Chin dogs carry themselves with the regalness of nobility. Their skulls are slightly round with short muzzles and an overall flat face, giving them a distinctive shape. But it's their silky coat that gives away their soft nature. Short and compact, these pups were born to be a lapdog.",
  "temperament_description": "A noble companion with vocals only a parent could love is a great way to describe the personality of the Japanese Chin (aka the Japanese Spaniel). These dogs are relaxed and loving, and can be quite attached to their pet parent—all things that make them both perfect and overqualified for the position of lapdog. They don't need a job to do; they just need to be with their people—especially when singing a duet with their person. Yes, these pups are singers, not barkers. They sing when the moment moves them, so make sure your karaoke machine is ready to roll. Born performers, they're also known for doing the “Chin spin\" dance when they get excited. (If you haven't seen it, you should look that up. It's adorable.)\r\n\r\nAlthough playful and loyal, Chins can also be sassy and strong-willed—they have a mind of their own, and they may not follow your directions like a Lab will. With proper training, however, these intelligent dogs can learn to be a well-behaved family member.\r\n\r\nChins are considered catlike in that they groom themselves like a cat, they like to climb, and you'll often find them perched on top of things, like the back of a chair or sofa. (And let's not forget about their independent streak.) Cats are actually their BFFs, but they'll need proper introductions and socialization with other dogs in the home.",
  "care_description": "Caring for a Japanese Chin dog is not as high-maintenance as you might think. Their grooming routine is relatively simple, as are their exercise needs. However, you will need to be consistent with their training because of their strong-willed streak—you can't slack off because they're just so darn cute.",
  "grooming_description": "Japanese Chins have the look of a dog who needs a full style team, but looks can be deceiving. Unlike other long-haired breeds, their beauty routine is simple. Brush their coat out once a week with a slicker brush to keep the coat smooth and be sure to check your pup's ears for debris, redness and swelling; if you notice any of the above, contact your veterinarian, who may recommend an at-home cleaning. Their nails grow quickly, so you may find yourself trimming them every other week. You'll know it's time when you can hear them tapping on your tile floors.\n\nBrush your Chin's teeth daily. It's important to start this routine while they're puppies, so they get used to it. Just like with you, brushing their teeth helps prevent dental disease and other health problems down the road. Once a year, have your vet give them a professional cleaning.\n\nStarting these daily rituals when they're a puppy not only keeps them looking camera-ready, it's also time spent bonding with your pup and it helps them get comfortable having their mouths and paws handled. This will lessen any anxiety and potential struggles when they visit the groomer or the vet.",
  "training_description": "Just because they're tiny doesn't mean they don't need training. The world is giant from their POV, and training helps a Japanese Chin know they're safe. These little pups can be strong-willed; they need consistent training to learn the ropes.\n\nAs you teach your pup basic commands like sit, stay, and come, be sure to stay positive and upbeat. Reward them when they do a good job with praise, treats and special toys. Be sure to take a break when both of you get frustrated. As former companion animals to kings and queens, they're eager to please and entertain you. Keep training sessions fun, and you'll both enjoy your time.\n\nEarly socialization is important for toy breeds like the Japanese Chin. Slowly introduce your pup to new people, places and other animals, so they become used to new situations. They need to know they're safe, and knowing what you want them to do helps them feel safe. Training shows them how to live in our big world with good manners—and maybe a fun trick or two for your entertainment.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Great news! Japanese Chins are happy to let you cook for them, but it's not a requirement. If you do choose to prep your pup's meals, be sure to run the menu by your vet. You want to make sure your pup gets all the nutrition they need. If you're not feeling quite so adventurous, your Chin's happy to dine on commercially prepared, high-quality dog food. Be sure to choose a formula based on their age and stage in life (puppy, adult senior). When in doubt, consult your veterinarian who is in the best position to help you make a decision based on your pet's individual needs and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBecause of their diminutive size, it's easy to overfeed them. (And they're so darn cute! You'll be giving lots of \"just because\" treats.) Even one extra pound can make a difference to their overall health. So, if you're pup's getting a little ... Rubenesque ... talk with your vet. They can help you create a diet and exercise plan to bring your Chin back to a healthy weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "A tired dog is a good dog, and that includes highly qualified lapdogs like the Japanese Chin. They're not built for marathons (unless you're bingeing your favorite streaming series, then they're built for that!). But they do enjoy a daily walk and investigating the great outdoors. So, plan on about 20 to 30 minutes every day. If you're letting them off-leash, keep them safe in a fenced-in backyard if you have one. In un-fenced areas, always keep your Japanese Chin on a leash. While they're wonderful companions, they're also strong-willed and curious, so they may not come back to you when you call.\r\n\r\nOne important thing about their size: Never leave them outside by themselves (not even for potty breaks). Birds like hawks and owls may mistake these small dogs for dinner and may try to carry them away. To keep them safe, always stay with your pup when you're out in fields or other large open areas. Be aware of your surroundings, and remember that a leashed pet is always safest.\r\n\r\nJapanese Chins are known for doing the “Chin spin.\" Have you seen it? Chins stand on their hind legs and spin and spin and spin. Usually, they're dancing for a treat or angling for your attention. While not a formal form of exercise, it's definitely energizing and a good way to wear out some of their energy.",
  "ideal_environment": "Japanese Chins can live just about anywhere. But they are perfect for smaller spaces like apartments or even those \"homes on the road\" (like with those exploring the country in an RV).\r\n\r\nChins are happy if you're flying solo or you're living life with kids, and they get along with dogs and cats too. The best part? They're so versatile that just about anyone can bring them home. If you're an experienced pet parent, they'll be quick to adjust. If you're new to the whole dog mom or dog dad thing, they'll get you up-to-speed on what it's like to be a great pet parent.\r\n\r\nThese pups are not outside dogs, and they're not fans of heat and humidity. (Their smooshy faces make it more difficult to breathe in the heat.) So, crank up the AC and pour a frosty beverage—this pup's all for chilling with you!",
  "health_description": "While Japanese Chins have a lifespan of 10 to 12 years, the breed is prone to a few health issues. But knowledge is power. Being aware of these conditions can help your pup live a long and happy life.\r\n\n \t• Cataracts: With cataracts, your pup looks like they have cloudy eyes. If your vet suspects this often-hereditary condition, they may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist to determine if your pup is a candidate for surgery.\nEpilepsy: Dogs with epilepsy will typically have their first seizure between 6 months and 5 years of age. Treatment is typically daily medication. Epilepsy is often hereditary and genetic screening testing is available.\nBrachycephalic Syndrome: Also called short-headed syndrome, this condition affects the breathing passage in dogs whose faces appear flattened or smooshed. This makes it difficult to breathe, especially in warm and humid conditions. Treatment is through managing your dog’s environment (making sure they don’t get overheated) and keeping them at a healthy weight. Some dogs may require surgery.\nEarly Onset Heart Murmur: This condition is likely caused by degeneration of the heart valves. If your veterinarian detects a murmur, they may refer your pup to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause.\nGM2 Gangliosidosis: Like Tay-Sachs disease in humans, this fatal, inherited neurological disorder has only been reported in Japanese Chins. Genetic screening testing is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "Is it rude to call a dog a walking contradiction? First, we tell you that this dog is often described as cat-like. Now you'll learn that they originated in China, not Japan. Here's how that happened:\r\n\r\nChina bestowed this regal baby on Japanese dignitaries for their service to the country. Though descended from dogs of Chinese nobility, it was the Japanese who brought the canine into our consciousness and onto our laps.\r\n\r\nCommodore Matthew Perry (no, not that Matthew Perry) was sent to Japan in the mid-1850s by then-United States President Franklin Pierce and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to establish trading posts with Japan on behalf of their respective countries. He returned with three sets of Imperial dogs as gifts for each of them (and a pair for himself). Two dogs survived, and he gave one to his daughter Caroline and her husband, August Belmont, Jr., who was the president of the American Kennel Club at the time.\r\n\r\nBut wait! Those two pups were never bred. It wasn't until the trade treaty between America and Japan in 1858 that Chins started coming to America. Their novelty shot them to fame, and they became one of the most popular breeds of the time.\r\n\r\nThough the AKC recognized the Japanese Chin in 1888, their popularity declined in the 20th century. But that just means when you bring a Chinese—oops—Japanese Chin puppy into your home, you will be one of few who can proudly proclaim that a member of your family descended from nobles.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Japanese Chin puppy to your family? You can find a reputable breeder on the AKC's website. The average price for a puppy is $2,000. But for that, you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact a Japanese Chin rescue or watch for the breed at your local animal shelter. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable Japanese Chins in your area.",
