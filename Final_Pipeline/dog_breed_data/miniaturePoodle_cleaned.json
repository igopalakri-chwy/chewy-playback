  "breed_intro": "Whether you’re at a farmer’s market, watching TV, or hanging out at a brewery, the active Miniature Poodle is the perfect plus-one for many of life’s little adventures. And because of their small size (Miniature Poodles, full-grown, top out at about 15 pounds), they it’s easy to bring this dog along.\n\nAnother Poodle perk: While no dog is completely allergen-free, Miniature Poodles are commonly considered to be hypoallergenic dogs, who might be a good fit for pet parents with allergies.",
  "appearance_description": "Miniature Poodles aren’t too big and aren’t too small—as the middle of the Poodle sizes, they’re just right. Falling between the tiny Toy Poodle and the large Standard Poodle, Minis stand 10–15 inches at the shoulder and weigh 10–15 pounds.\n\nBut aside from size, Miniature Poodles share a lot of the same characteristics that Toys and Standards have. They have an instantly recognizable coat of tight curls that cover the body, floppy ears, and dark but shiny eyes.",
  "temperament_description": "As playful social butterflies, Miniature Poodles can quickly adapt to life in a busy household. Are your weekends filled with errands? This dog is happy to join you. Do you have other pets and young kiddos at home? With proper socialization, a Miniature Poodle will be their pal.\n\n“They love children and cats and dogs, and even enjoy watching fish swim,” says Ann Wheeler, president of the Poodle Club of Oklahoma City and an experienced Miniature Poodle breeder.\n\nDon’t underestimate a Miniature Poodle. They need a daily schedule filled with exercise and mental stimulation to keep their brain busy and engaged—otherwise, a Mini Poodle might find creative ways to keep boredom at bay, including excessive barking or destructive behaviors like chewing up your couch cushions.\n\nMiniature Poodles, like their Toy and Standard Poodle relatives, are also one of the smartest dog breeds on record. They have an uncanny ability to learn new tricks and can solve puzzle toys in record time. (This makes keeping them busy and engaged even more important!)",
  "care_description": "Mini Poodles are cute, yes, but they (like all dogs) require grooming, training, exercise, and all other types of care. Carefully consider what this breed needs before bringing home a Miniature Poodle puppy.",
  "grooming_description": "The breed’s distinctive, curly coat is commonly groomed into one of the following popular Miniature Poodle haircuts:\r\n\n\t• The puppy cut: Hair is trimmed short to be the same length everywhere. This is popular with Miniature Poodle puppies and those who are house pets (that is, pups who don’t have to worry about show dog styles).\nThe English saddle: Shaved all over, except for puffs on the head, bottom of the legs, and top of the tail\nThe continental: The traditional “French Poodle” cut\nThe sporting clip: The face, feet, neck, and base of the tail are shaved. A pouf is left on the head and tail, while the rest of the body is trimmed to 1 inch in length.\r\n\n“Poodles require grooming every four to six weeks, along with at least weekly brush-outs to keep their coats healthy and mat-free,” says Nancy Palauskas, member of the Poodle Club of America and owner of Songbird Poodles. \n\nKeep in mind: The longer you keep your dog’s hair, the more brushing it needs. Use a slicker brush to work out tangles.\n\nAlong with coat care, Miniature Poodles need regular at-home upkeep, including:\r\n\n\t• Eye care: Some dogs, especially light-colored and white Miniature Poodles, might develop tear stains around their eyes. Use a vet-recommended tear stain remover to gently clean their face.\nEar care: A Mini Poodle’s floppy ears can harbor bacteria, yeast, and debris, leading to ear infections. Be alert for signs and ask your vet if cleaning your dog’s ears is a necessary routine.\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth every day to prevent dental disease and tooth loss.\nNail care: If you can hear your Miniature Poodle’s nails clicking across the floor, it’s time for a trim.",
  "training_description": "While your grooming to-do list will be long, Miniature Poodles are easy to train.\n\n“Because of their intelligence and desire to please, they are very motivated to learn quickly,” Wheeler says. This is true for everything from potty training to essential obedience cues like sit and stay.\n\nTheir brainy reputation means that Miniature Poodles are fast-learners and often a good pick for first-time pet parents. But it’s still important for pet parents to invest time, consistency, and patience into training their dog. Having your pockets stuffed with training treats helps, too.\n\nAlong with training, Miniature Poodle puppies need socialization early and often so they can grow into their full, friendly potential. Ask your vet how to best expose your puppy to new people, animals, and environments while keeping them safe and comfortable.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A Miniature Poodle needs a high-quality dog food. To make sure it’s nutritionally complete, look for a food with the AAFCO statement on the packaging.\n\nThe food must also be formulated for your dog’s life stage; Miniature Poodle puppies need a puppy food before switching to adult food around their first birthday. Some brands, including Royal Canin, sell dog food specifically made for Poodles.\n\nPalauskas recommends feeding full-grown Miniature Poodles once or twice a day. Mini Poodle puppies may need to eat more often (up to four smaller meals every day) to reduce the chance of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).\n\nTo help keep your smart pup entertained, try feeding your Miniature Poodle with a puzzle toy, snuffle mat, or slow feeder.",
  "exercise_description": "Miniature Poodles need daily opportunities to stretch their legs and work out their energy. Take at least one long walk a day. And because these dogs love to play, they’ll always be ready for a game of fetch in the back yard or tug-of-war in the living room.\n\nYou can also channel their natural abilities into popular canine competitions. “Miniature Poodles excel in many dog sports, including agility, obedience, rally, flyball, and tracking,” Palauskas says.\n\nPhysical exercise and mental stimulation go paw-in-paw. A Miniature Poodle needs opportunities each day to use their brain. Activities like playing hide-and-seek for a treat can provide a healthy challenge. Or you can use interactive toys, like puzzles or treat dispensers, for a bit of fun.",
  "ideal_environment": "Despite the popular view that Miniature Poodles are persnickety, they’re actually remarkably adaptive. A full-grown Miniature Poodle is still small enough to live in just about any space, and their personality makes them a good fit almost anywhere, too.\n\nWheeler says that with a good walk every day (or multiple walks a day, if you don’t have a yard) and ample time spent with pet parents, a Miniature Poodle will be happy. They’re happy to keep up with an active family, play with other pets and children (under supervision!), and join you for snuggles in the evening.\n\nUltimately, Miniature Poodles want to feel like valued members of the family, and interact with people throughout the day in and out of the home. If you need to leave your pup by their lonesome for a few hours, consider hiring a dog walker or enrolling your pup in doggy daycare.",
  "health_description": "The average Miniature Poodle lifespan is 10–18 years, and “living 15 or more years isn’t unusual,” says Palauskas. They’re typically a healthy dog breed, though some health conditions may pop up.\r\n\n\t• Hip dysplasia: Mini Poodles may be susceptible to hip dysplasia, a condition where the hip’s ball and socket joint doesn’t fit together correctly, causing mobility issues and arthritis. Treatment might include medication, joint supplements, physical therapy, and (in severe cases) surgery.\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease: Miniature Poodles can develop another hip condition called Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, which is a hereditary condition that occurs most often in young dogs. This condition causes the head of the femur (thigh bone) to die, leading the hip to become dysfunctional. It’s usually treated with surgery.\nElbow dysplasia: Elbow dysplasia is similar to hip dysplasia, when the dog’s elbow joint doesn’t develop normally. It also leads to mobility problems and arthritis, and treatment can involve medications, weight management, and surgery.\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA is when the rods and cones in a dog’s eyes break down, leading to vision loss. There is no cure, but reputable Miniature Poodle breeders test their dogs for this genetic condition to avoid passing it on to their puppies.\nPatellar luxation: A luxating patella is when a dog’s kneecap slips out of place, resulting in a limp. This usually corrects itself, but severe cases may need surgery.\r\n\n“A well-bred Poodle from a reputable breeder will have written documentation from a vet and the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) of health testing completed by the puppy’s parents,” Wheeler says. “This ensures the puppy will grow up free of these problems.”",
  "history_description": "Miniature Poodles are a smaller version of Standard Poodles. Standards were originally bred in Germany as a smart and capable hunting companion, who readily dove into water to retrieve ducks for their humans.\n\nAccording to the Poodle Club of America, Miniature Poodles and Toy Poodles were bred down from these hunting dogs to be companions. Miniature Poodles are active, smart, and maintain the “rugged” build of their Standard Poodle ancestor—just in a smaller size.",
