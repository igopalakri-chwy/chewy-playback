  "breed_intro": "Get ready to turn heads, because with an Afghan Hound, you’re not just walking a dog—you’re walking a runway model.\n\nThat flowing coat? Iconic. Their sleek build? High fashion. But don’t be fooled by the glamour—these independent spirits can be aloof and a little strong-willed, but totally worth the effort.\n\nIf you’re an experienced pet parent who enjoys a challenge that’s elegantly wrapped, the Afghan Hound might be the ideal dog for you.",
  "appearance_description": "The Afghan Hound is a graceful breed identified by a narrow build; long, silky coat; and proud posture. Everywhere they go, they draw attention with their eye-catching appearance, which is both regal and distinctive in the dog world.",
  "temperament_description": "Afghan Hounds are known for having independent—and occasionally distant—personalities, but this doesn't mean they lack affection. They tend to form strong bonds with their families and, once comfortable, can be charming and even silly.\n\n“Many people describe the Afghan Hound as having an aloof, cat-like temperament,” says Scott Pfeil, former president of the Afghan Hound Club of America. “They bond closely to their [pet parents] without being overly demonstrative and can be rather indifferent to strangers.”\n\nThis breed is usually gentle and gets along well with older, less-rambunctious children. But the Afghan Hound’s strong prey drive and independent spirit might not make them ideal for homes with small pets.\n\n“Remember that this is a hunting hound with a strong, centuries-old prey drive,” Pfeil says. They were originally bred to hunt large game in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan, where the dogs used their speed, agility, and sharp vision to chase prey.\n\nBecause of this, small animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will likely always be viewed as prey to chase after. But familiar cats and small dogs can be safe when supervised—especially if an Afghan Hound is raised around them.\n\nWhile not commonly used as working dogs today, Afghan Hounds excel in lure coursing and are show-ring favorites thanks to their elegance. But at home, these hounds prefer a calm, low-key environment.",
  "care_description": "Embracing an Afghan Hound's independence and beauty is an essential part of their care. As a pet parent, expect to offer daily exercise (a few long walks or jogging sessions per day); patient and gentle training; and regular grooming to keep their long hair looking gorgeous.",
  "grooming_description": "To maintain their lavish coat, Afghan Hounds need care and commitment to grooming.\n\n“Many people are drawn to the Afghan Hound’s long, flowing hair, but this beauty comes with high maintenance,” Pfeil says. “Keeping an Afghan in a full coat requires … bathing and frequent brushing. It’s not difficult, but it is a significant time commitment. Without consistency, coats quickly become matted, causing discomfort for the dog.”\n\nHere’s what an Afghan Hound’s full grooming regimen calls for:\r\n\n\t• Bathing: Schedule a sudsy bath for your Afghan dog every four to six weeks. Use a gentle, dog-safe shampoo and conditioner for a healthy coat.\nBrushing: Brush your dog’s hair every day with a pin brush or comb. This is important upkeep because an Afghan Hound’s long hair gets tangled easily. Pay extra attention to their underside, ears, and legs.\nNail trimming: Monthly nail trims are a must, too.\nEar cleaning: Every so often, take a peek at your pup’s ears to check for signs of an infection (like an odor, redness, or debris buildup). Your vet might recommend adding regular ear cleanings to your grooming routine.\nDental care: To avoid dental disease and maintain healthy pearly whites, brush your dog’s teeth every day (or at least once a week). Use a dog-safe toothpaste and toothbrush.\r\n\nThough you’ll need to stay on top of daily brushing (for both fur and teeth), a professional groomer can help with other maintenance like bathing and nail-trimming.",
  "training_description": "Because they’re smart but strong-minded dogs, training an Afghan Hound can be challenging, especially for first-time pet parents.\n\n“The Afghan Hound is very independent and likes to think for himself,” Pfeil says. “Training requires patience and positive reinforcement.” Stick to short, interactive sessions with treats, praise, and play.\n\nPrioritize recall and good leash manners during your Afghan dog’s obedience training. This is important for all dogs, but especially for historic hunting dogs like the Afghan Hound, who may be tempted to chase critters in the neighborhood.\n\n“You should never allow an Afghan off-leash unless in a securely fenced area—ideally [with a fence] 6 feet high, due to their remarkable jumping abilities,” Pfeil says.\n\nEarly and consistent socialization is also essential for an Afghan Hound puppy. Regular, early exposure to new people, animals, and environments helps Afghans feel comfortable. It’ll also stop their natural aloof nature from turning into fearfulness.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Afghan Hounds thrive on high-quality dog food balanced for their age, size, and activity level. Always choose dog food that’s Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) compliant, such as Purina or Royal Canin.\n\nBecause of their build, Afghan Hounds are susceptible to a life-threatening condition called gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). Pet parents can take simple steps during mealtime to reduce the chances of GDV, including:\r\n\n\t• Feeding an Afghan Hound at least two smaller meals every day instead of one big meal per day\nOffering food in a slow feeder bowl, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy to stop the dog from gobbling too quickly\nAvoiding elevated food bowls\nRestricting exercise for an hour before or after eating",
  "exercise_description": "Afghan Hounds aren’t just looks—these dogs are natural athletes and need at least an hour of exercise each day.\n\nTheir favorite pastimes draw on their innate love of running and chasing; lure coursing, brisk walks, jogs, games of fetch, and hikes are all high on their list. Just make sure you always keep them on a leash or inside a fenced space when outside.\n\nAt home, try puzzle toys, interactive games, or a backyard agility course to prevent boredom.",
  "ideal_environment": "Afghan Hounds need to stretch their long legs and thrive best in homes with lots of space, preferably with access to a fenced yard where they can safely run and play. But they can also adapt to apartment life if their pet parent makes daily exercise a top priority.\n\nAlong with their hour of heart-pumping exercise, Afghan Hounds need daily brushing sessions and a larger grooming overhaul once a month. Make sure you have the time—or the budget for a professional groomer—before bringing an Afghan Hound puppy home.\n\nA calm, structured household tends to suit their independent and sensitive nature. While generally good with polite, respectful children, Afghans aren't overly playful or affectionate. They’re best suited to families with older children who understand how to interact gently and respectfully with dogs.\n\nAfghan Hounds can do well in homes with familiar pets, especially if they were raised alongside them. But smaller animals like rabbits or guinea pigs might trigger the dogs’ hunting instincts.",
  "health_description": "The average Afghan Hounds lifespan is 12–18 years. They’re one of the dog breeds who live the longest—an impressive feat, since large dogs like the Afghan Hound typically don’t live as long as smaller breeds.\n\nDespite their longevity, Afghan Hounds (like all dogs) can develop certain health conditions over the course of their life, including:\r\n\n\t• Cataracts: Afghan Hounds are susceptible to cataracts, especially as they age. Cataracts can cause blindness but are fixable with surgery.\nAllergies and skin sensitivities: Afghan Hounds can be prone to allergies and secondary skin infections. Symptoms may include itching, ear infections, or gastrointestinal upset.\nChylothorax: This serious condition involves accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity, which can make breathing difficult. Thankfully, the condition is rare and can be treated.\nBloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus: Like many deep-chested breeds, Afghan Hounds are at risk of bloat, where the stomach becomes distended with gas and/or food. The stomach can sometimes twist, leading to life-threatening GDV. Talk to your vet about whether your dog is a fit for a preventive gastropexy procedure, which can help protect your Afghan Hound from GDV.",
  "history_description": "The Afghan Hound is an ancient dog breed. Their origins trace back thousands of years to the rugged mountains and deserts of Afghanistan.\n\nNomadic peoples developed the sight hounds for their speed, agility, and keen eyesight, making them exceptional hunters of game such as gazelles and hares. Their long, flowing coat provided protection against the harsh climate in the Middle East.\n\nThe breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1926. Today, Afghan Hounds are admired around the world not just for their beauty, but also for their fascinating history, unique personality, and timeless elegance.\n\nWhen looking for Afghan Hound puppies, be prepared to pay. Prices typically start around $1,500. You can also look for an Afghan Hound for adoption through a breed-specific rescue or via Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs.",
