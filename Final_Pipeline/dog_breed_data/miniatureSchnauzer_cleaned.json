  "breed_intro": "Are you looking for a pup who matches your on-the-go, fun-centric life? Meet the Miniature Schnauzer. This dog is ready to jump right into your busy life, making friends at social events, trotting through town beside you and showing off their tricks at every opportunity. Plus, their compact size makes them great dogs for urban apartment dwellers, as long as they still get their exercise needs met. Invite this life-of-the-party dog into your inner circle and watch them amplify the excitement in your everyday life.",
  "appearance_description": "With their perky, inquisitive ears and scruffy facial hair, the Miniature Schnauzer is a lively little dog who's almost always in motion. This breed has dark brown eyes and a solid black nose with a docked tail that stands up straight. Their color combos come in salt and pepper, black and silver, or solid black.",
  "temperament_description": "The Miniature Schnauzer's size is small, but in many ways, this gregarious breed acts like a big dog in a small body. Feisty and spunky top the list of their qualities. But despite their larger-than-life personality, this breed is also sweet and affectionate, happy to snuggle with you on the couch. Mini Schnauzers are very attached to their people and want to be wherever you are at all times.\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzer dogs are generally good with children. They're loving little dogs who are always ready to play. The children in their lives must understand how to play gently with small dogs, though'kids, especially younger ones, sometimes play too rough with smaller dog breeds. Miniature Schnauzers' friendly temperaments often lead them to pair well with other pets, although their big personality can sometimes mean they confront larger dogs, and their terrier prey drive may stand in the way of friendships with small animals. (They do like to chase.) Start socializing your dog early, so they'll be well-behaved around smaller children and other pets.\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzers bond so strongly with their families that they can be aloof toward new people coming into the home. But as soon as your pup sees you interacting with a stranger, they'll likely be friendly toward the new person, too. And while Miniature Schnauzers are very noisy, they're not known to bite. Again, proper socialization and training for this eager-to-please breed will go a long way.",
  "care_description": "In general, the Miniature Schnauzer's needs match their stature: relatively small. They're highly trainable, and their exercise needs are pretty average. Grooming a Mini Schnauzer is a bigger task, but with the help of a professional groomer, you'll be able to learn the ropes.",
  "grooming_description": "First, the good news: Miniature Schnauzer shedding is minimal. However, this breed does call for regular grooming, which includes trips to the groomer every four to six weeks, baths at home a few times a month and brushing with a slicker brush every day. You'll become well-acquainted with your pup's hard top coat and downy undercoat. Before a bath, Schnauzers need \"hand stripping,\" a term that refers to removing the dead hairs from the dog's topcoat using a special knife. (If you're not showing your dog, you can have the groomer take care of the coat with clippers.)\n\nIn addition to monthly baths and daily brushing, you'll want to trim your dog's toenails at least once a month. When you hear the nails clacking on the floor, you'll know it's time.\n\nBrush their teeth every day with dog toothpaste and a dog toothbrush. Regular tooth brushing is important to keep your dog's teeth and gums healthy. If possible, start brushing your dog's teeth when they're still a puppy, so they'll grow up already used to the ritual. You'll also want to visit your vet for a professional tooth cleaning once a year.\n\nFinally, check your Miniature Schnauzer's ears every two weeks for debris or excess wax; the hair growing inside them, if untended, can cause infection. If you notice anything, speak to your vet.",
  "training_description": "Miniature Schnauzers are intelligent dogs who love to learn. They think learning new things is fun, and they're eager to please you, which helps makes them less distractible and easier to train. You'll likely find your Miniature Schnauzer is highly engaged and ready to do whatever they can for you. Basic obedience training (learning commands like sit, stay, come and how to walk nicely on a leash) will be a breeze, and many Mini Schnauzers love learning additional tricks they can show off, like shaking their paw.\n\nSometimes, your Miniature Schnauzer puppy might show their stubborn side during a training session. Remember to be patient and consistent, and take a break so neither of you gets frustrated.\n\nBe sure to socialize your naturally friendly pup, safely introducing them to new people, other dogs and experiences while they're young. Take them on walks and let them meet'and sniff'new people and other dogs. Enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people'all in one place.\n\nMiniature Schnauzers are part of the Terrier group, and terriers like to make their voice heard! You can't train the bark completely out of your pup, but you can help curb it. Pro tip: Train them to recognize an \"all clear\" signal that lets them know you've heard them and recognized the reason they're barking. This way, your dog is allowed to tell you when they notice something happening, but can quickly quiet down when you give the sign. Think of it as an 'on/off\" switch for your dog.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Miniature Schnauzers will thrive on a diet consisting of a high-quality commercial dog food. Check the packaging for a statement that says the food meets nutritional standards set by AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) to make sure you're purchasing a complete and balanced product. If you're not sure about portion sizes, your vet can help you figure out the right amount of food for your pup. Make sure you also select a dog food that's made for your dog's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, or senior).\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzers have a predisposition for hyperlipidemia (also known as high cholesterol) and pancreatitis. Often, this means they should be fed a moderate- to low-fat diet, but check with your vet first. Avoid table scraps, and consider giving your dog low-fat treats.\r\n\r\nIf you have specific questions about what to feed your dog and how much, chat with your vet. They are in the best position to give you advice about your pup's mealtime.",
  "exercise_description": "Fairly energetic and playful, Miniature Schnauzers need about 45 to 60 minutes of exercise every day. If you don't have a fenced yard, a good long walk on a leash will meet your pup's daily energy requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to going for walks, Miniature Schnauzers enjoy playing fetch and running around (they can be speedy pups!). Some Schnauzers may even enjoy swimming, if trained to do so. While the breed as a whole doesn't naturally love water, some Miniature Schnauzers can learn to enjoy a dip on a hot day. (Never force your dog to swim if they don't want to, of course.) You should always closely supervise your Schnauzer around bodies of water and make sure they wear a dog life jacket, as these dogs aren't necessarily strong swimmers.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to provide your Schnauzer with plenty of mental stimulation. Playing games inside or going to a training class can help wear out your dog mentally and meet your Miniature Schnauzer's exercise needs.",
  "ideal_environment": "Miniature Schnauzers are affectionate dogs who make great family pets. These dogs are generally a good match with kids, their playful antics keeping children entertained. Miniature Schnauzers are also normally friendly with other dogs and with cats.\r\n\r\nThe Miniature Schnauzer breed is highly adaptable, making them a great option if you live in a small apartment or in the city. Still, they appreciate having outdoor space to run and play. As long as you're able to give your pup the daily exercise they need, they'll be perfectly happy in a small city apartment. If you do live in a home with a yard, make sure your yard is fenced'terriers love to chase things, and Miniature Schnauzers are prone to taking off if they spy a critter they feel needs chasing.\r\n\r\nIf you've never had a dog before, a Miniature Schnauzer will make your job easy. Their outgoing personality, trainability and relatively average exercise needs mean this breed is a great fit for a new pup parent.",
  "health_description": "Miniature Schnauzers have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years, and overall, the dog is a fairly healthy breed. The good news is that many of their common health conditions can be avoided if you feed your Schnauzer a proper diet and provide plenty of opportunity for exercise.\r\n\r\n \tPancreatitis: Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is a serious condition which often requires hospitalization for treatment. While the cause is not completely understood, there is likely a genetic component and eating foods high in fat may be a component.  Long-term management often includes a strict low-fat diet.\r\n \tDiabetes Mellitus: Miniature Schnauzers are prone to diabetes which can be caused by a pre-existing condition, like pancreatitis, obesity, Cushing's disease or genetics. Diabetes in dogs is typically treated with insulin therapy and sometimes diet changes.\r\n \tCataracts: Miniature Schnauzer are prone to developing cataracts both as an inherited condition and secondary to diabetes. Often they can be surgically removed.\r\n \tBladder Stones: Bladder stones are often caused by diet or other conditions in the bladder, like a bladder infection. Symptoms include urinary accidents, straining to urinate and blood in the urine. If your Miniature Schnauzer has bladder stones, they may need surgery to remove them. Diet changes might be necessary post-surgery to prevent more stones from developing.\r\n \tPortosystemic Shunt: A portosystemic shunt, or liver shunt, is formed when blood vessels bypass the liver and is often caused by a birth defect. Symptoms include stunted growth, increased drinking and urinating, as well as circling or head pressing. Treatments often include diet change, medication, and in some cases surgery.\r\n \tMyotonia: Myotonia congenita is a genetic muscle disorder that causes a schnauzer's muscles to stay contracted. A DNA test will show whether your dog or their parents are carriers of the myotonia gene. The condition can be managed with medications.\r\n \tVon Willebrand Disease: If a dog has this inherited disease, their blood can't clot correctly. Typically dogs with this condition are asymptomatic in their daily lives but may need blood transfusions if they have an injury or need surgery.\r\n \tMycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC): MAC is a very rare but lethal defect of the immune system that causes overwhelming infection in affected pups. A genetic screening test is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "As you might have guessed from the sound of the name \"Schnauzer,\" these dogs originated in Germany'specifically Germany in the 19th century, when the Standard Schnauzer was bred with the Poodle and the Affenpinscher to create a whole new type of dog. Miniature Schnauzers were originally used as farm dogs, working as ratters and guard dogs.\r\n\r\nBreeders in the United States began breeding Miniature Schnauzers in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1926. There are three types of Schnauzers'Miniature, Standard and Giant'and each one is considered a distinct breed.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Miniature Schnauzer has become a popular breed; they currently rank No. 19 out of the 197 dog breeds recognized by the AKC. If you're looking for one, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a Miniature Schnauzer puppy to welcome into your home. Work with an AKC-registered breeder to locate the best dog for you. A purebred Miniature Schnauzer price is normally between $500 and $2,000. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also keep an eye out at your local animal shelter, check with a Miniature Schnauzer rescue to adopt a dog or or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
