  "breed_intro": "Gather ’round, because the Toy Poodle loves being the star of the show, especially when their audience rewards their entertaining antics with treats. As long as they’re showered in attention, this pint-size pup is happy.\n\nToy Poodles are curly-coated dogs with a bright and cheery disposition. These characteristics, along with their impeccable intelligence, mean Toy Poodles easily learn new cues, routines, and tricks. So easily, in fact, that the breed often worked as circus performers in the 18th century.\n\nWhile the dogs do need daily grooming care, they are so, so small that brushing and other maintenance take very little time out of your schedule. (A Toy Poodle, full grown, weighs less than 10 pounds.)",
  "appearance_description": "The Toy Poodle has a petite but polished appearance. Although they are the smallest variety of the Poodle breeds (the others being the Standard Poodle and the Miniature Poodle), Toys are no less distinguished in their appearance. In fact, the only difference among the three Poodles’ breed standards is size.",
  "temperament_description": "A Toy Poodle is a big personality in an itty-bitty package. Although these dogs are less than 10 inches tall, their small frame contains a surprising amount of energy. They’re very smart and need regular exercise and playtime.  \n\nBecause of this, they make good family dogs—but extra caution must be taken. While Toy Poodles are generally kid-friendly, always supervise interactions with children. Due to the small size of Toy Poodle dogs and puppies, they can be more susceptible to injury than larger dogs.\n\n“One drop or trip can result in a broken leg or worse,” says Carol Dean, an experienced Toy Poodle breeder—and the toy and variety representative for the Poodle Club of America (PCA).\n\nThis applies when your Toy Poodle plays with bigger dogs, too. (And when you’re only 4–6 pounds, almost every dog is bigger!). Keep a close eye on your pet to make sure the play doesn’t become too rough.\n\nOverall, Toy Poodles are affectionate attention-seekers who love to spend time with family members. They aren’t likely to let you ignore them for long!",
  "care_description": "The bouncy and affectionate nature of a Toy Poodle means these dogs are ready for just about any activity—as long as it involves you. To properly care for these companion pups, you’ll need to plan on spending regular time each day on exercise, training, and grooming.",
  "grooming_description": "“Poodles are one of the few breeds that have what is considered hair rather than fur,” says Carolyn Holmes, president of the Orlando Poodle Club and breeder at Carmine Poodles. “That is to say, it grows continuously, like human hair.”\n\nTo keep a Toy Poodle’s coat in tip-top shape, you’ll need to plan on frequent brushing and regular trips to the groomer for a haircut.\n\n“All poodles should be groomed on a four- to six-week schedule,” Dean says. Think of a trip to the groomer as a trip to the doggy salon—they’ll be bathed, brushed, and get a haircut.\n\nDon’t overlook your dog’s ears, eyes, teeth, and nails—they need upkeep, too.\r\n\n\t• Bathing: Bathe your Toy Poodle once a month using a dog-friendly shampoo and conditioner.\nBrushing: Brush your dog’s hair regularly; whether you need to do this weekly or daily depends on your Toy Poodle’s haircut. (“The shorter the haircut, the less brushing it will need,” Holmes says.) Use a slicker brush to remove loose hair and a pin brush to gently work through tangles.\nClipping: Popular Toy Poodle haircuts range from a traditional look (with a shaved face, feet, and base of tail accented by a blanket of hair on the body and ears), to a more natural look with no shaving at all, with many choices of styles in between.\nDental care: It’s important to brush your dog’s teeth every day. Toy Poodles are highly prone to dental disease, and brushing is the best way to prevent the painful condition.\nEar care: Stay alert for signs your dog has an ear infection, and ask your vet if ear-cleaning should be part of your grooming regimen.\nEye care: Toy Poodles, especially those with lighter coats, can develop tear stains. Gently clean the areas around the eyes with a tear stain remover.\nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails every few weeks. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they’re too long.",
  "training_description": "Toy Poodles, along with their Standard and Mini Poodle relatives, are known for being one of the smartest dog breeds.\n\nTheir smarts, along with their eagerness to please, streamline the training process and make it fun to work with your Toy Poodle on essential obedience cues (like sit, stay, and come) and entertaining tricks. Toy Poodles are also people-pleasers, Dean says, so they can be a good fit for first-time pet parents who might have trouble training a more independent dog breed. \n\nDespite their trainability, sometimes Toy Poodles are a challenge to potty train because of their small bladder. But consistent effort—and patience—will make housetraining successful.\n\nSocializing your Toy Poodle puppy is important, too. While the breed has a reputation for being social, all dogs are individuals with unique personalities. Socialization helps your pup grow confident and reach their full, friendly potential.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Full-grown Toy Poodles benefit from two measured meals a day. But Toy Poodle puppies, because they are just so small, often need to eat more frequently to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), Dean says. Until your pup is 1 year old, make sure they eat three to four meals every day.\n\nTalk to your vet to find the best dog food for your Toy Poodle. The food must be AAFCO-compliant, suitable for little mouths, and formulated for your pup’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some brands, like Royal Canin, even make dog food just for Poodles.\n\nUsing puzzle feeders, slow feeders, or snuffle mats can make mealtime more fun for your Toy Poodle.",
  "exercise_description": "Most Toy Poodles need about an hour of exercise every day. This might be surprising given the breed’s small stature, but it’s important to remember that Toy Poodles are still dogs—not teddy bears or accessories—and have an impressive amount of energy.\n\nBut instead of running marathons or hiking in the mountains, a Toy Poodle’s exercise needs can be easily met from home. Walks around the block, games of fetch (in a backyard or even in the living room), and trick training are some favorite pastimes. Your Toy Poodle might also be a standout in dog sports like agility.\n\nIt’s important to exercise this brainy pup’s mind, too. Toy Poodles will have fun playing with puzzle games or interactive toys, especially when you’re busy or away from home.",
  "ideal_environment": "A Toy Poodle’s small size, low-shedding coat, and eager-to-please attitude make these pups ideal apartment or condo companions. But they also thrive in suburban houses or life in the country.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that a tiny Toy Poodle can be vulnerable.\n\n“As with all toy dogs, they must be protected from predators such as owls, eagles, and raccoons when outdoors, especially in country settings,” Holmes says. “So keep in mind that while the Miniature and Standard Poodles love duck-retrieving in ponds and tracking work in the woods, the Toy Poodle is definitely a house pet.”\n\nThis breed thrives on connection and companionship; they may develop separation anxiety if left alone for long amounts of time. Homebodies—or people looking to take their dog everywhere with them—make the best Toy Poodle parents.\n\n“They need people around all the time,” Dean says. “They truly are a person in a fuzzy suit.”",
  "health_description": "As a healthy dog, the typical Toy Poodle lifespan is 10–18 years. But like all dogs, they can develop certain health conditions over their long life.\r\n\n\t• Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA in dogs causes the rod and cone cells on the retina to break down. An early sign of PRA is difficulty seeing at night, but the condition gradually progresses to total blindness. There is no cure for PRA.\nPatellar luxation: The patella is the kneecap, and when it slips out of place, this is called patellar luxation. You might see your Toy Poodle limping or walking with a bunny-hop gait—these are common symptoms. The condition often corrects itself on its own, but severe cases might need surgery.\nDental disease: Small breeds like the Toy Poodle often develop dental issues because their tiny mouths cause tooth overcrowding and tartar buildup. Preventive care—like brushing your dog’s teeth, offering dental chews, and using water additives to protect their teeth—is important. Your vet will recommend professional dental cleanings as needed.\r\n\nWith routine veterinary care, a healthy diet, and enough exercise, Toy Poodles are one of the longest-living dog breeds.",
  "history_description": "The history of the Toy Poodle begins with the Standard Poodle. These dogs are much larger (up to 70 pounds!) and worked as water retrievers for duck hunters, according to the Poodle Club of America.\n\nThe striking appearance of the Poodle created a desire for a smaller companion dog that would retain the same intelligence and attributes. This led to the Miniature Poodle, which was developed in France and became a favorite of nobility and traveling performers alike.\n\nIn the 1900s, the even more diminutive Toy Poodle was developed in the United States. But all three Poodle sizes share similar personality traits and a nearly identical appearance—despite the major size difference.",
