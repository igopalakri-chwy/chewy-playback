  "breed_intro": "Looking for a truly loyal BFF? Rat Terriers live up to the term \"man's best friend\"—their temperament is as devoted as their ears are perky. (Spoiler: That's a lot.) They'll go where you go; they'll love who you love (mostly). You'll have to forgive them for having a bit of a stubborn streak—they may be too smart for their own good, but they are likely to make up for it by being a fast learner in training or winning you a ribbon in an agility show. If you commit to teaching them your rules, you'll have an energetic, playful bestie to fall in love with in no time.",
  "appearance_description": "Rat Terriers have expressive, alert faces that reflect their zest for life. They're built like a doggie gymnast, muscular and ready to work; and they come in two sizes: Miniature (10-13 inches) and Standard (13-18 inches). They have a wide combination of colors in a pied pattern (large colored patches mingled with white). Their perky ears are always alert and listening for the next source of excitement.",
  "temperament_description": "Rat Terriers are a big personality in a compact body. Inquisitive and highly intelligent, these qualities work in their favor when it comes to puzzles and games that will provide seemingly endless entertainment.\n\nWhen they're given a job to do, however, things get serious. They give 100 percent whether they're hunting vermin, running agility or having a training session. Because Rat Terrier dogs were bred to both function as a working dog and live with a family, they can master both equally.\n\nThese small-sized dogs are usually very friendly and tend to get along with kids and other dogs, but it's important to remember that all dogs are individuals so this can differ from Rattie to Rattie. As long as your dog is properly socialized (aka introduced to different people and environments) from a young age, they'll be a great companion for all the family, and a friend to anyone they meet. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\n\nAs their name implies, these dogs kind of have a thing for vermin. So you may want to rethink a Rat Terrier if you keep house with rats, mice, hamsters or birds unless you take precautions to keep them separated. The same goes for cats, but with early and deliberate introductions as Rat Terrier puppies, the two can definitely thrive together.\n\nRat Terriers are good watchdogs, so don't be surprised if they bark when someone comes to the door. If you feel that it's excessive, there are options to help you reduce your dog's barking.\n\nOverall, Rat Terriers are devoted to their people and they love to be included, so don't leave them alone for too long or they will pine for you. Don't forget that they still operate on instinct—no matter their training, your Rattie might still make the occasional, sudden lunge for a squirrel on your afternoon walk. They're just doing what they were bred to do!",
  "care_description": "Rat Terriers are pretty low maintenance when it comes to their grooming needs, but when it comes to training, they need daily exercise and a pet parent who is as determined and dedicated as they are. They're affectionate and love family life, and they are adaptable enough to be anything from apartment-dwellers to farm hands.",
  "grooming_description": "Here's the good news: The Rat Terrier's short, compact coat is relatively low-maintenance. Here are grooming tips for your Rat Terrier:\n\n \t• Brushing: They only need a weekly brushing using a curry brush or rubber mitt to keep their coats shiny and healthy. Ratties are considered seasonal shedders so, while they do shed throughout the year, it's heaviest in the spring and fall. Keeping up with the weekly brushing will prevent tiny Rattie hairs from invading your home.\nBathing: Unless they've had extra fun outside (aka Rattie vs dirt pile), you only need to bathe them monthly, but you can use a deodorizing spritz to freshen them up in between.\nDental care: Ratties need an annual professional tooth cleaning with your veterinarian, along with a good daily toothbrushing. This is important because, like their other small breed counterparts, Rat Terriers are more prone to dental disease because there's not a lot of room in their mouths for all their teeth. Veterinarians can teach pet parents how to brush dog teeth, and starting out as puppies will help them get used to the idea faster.\nNail trimming: Your Rat Terrier's nails need to be trimmed about once a month because long nails can be painful for them to walk on. Check them weekly, and use your judgement on how often to trim them. But it's definitely time to get the nail clippers out when you hear the unmistakable tap-tapping on the floor.\nEar cleaning: It's also recommended to check your Rat Terrier's ears once a week as excess wax and debris can cause infections. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.",
  "training_description": "Ratties are bright, motivated and fast learners, which makes them easy to train. Do some homework on puppy training, and start them out early with some basic commands like sit, stay and come. Remember that training doesn't end when they grow beyond puppyhood. These dogs love to please and need mental stimulation, so don't hold back on graduating them to some fun nose work or performing behavior chains, completing a number of commands before getting that all-important treat or other positive reinforcement.\n\nRewards-based training works best for the Rat Terrier, so prepare to give them plenty of praise and invest in some dog training treats (within reason, as you don't want your pooch getting a paunch). They are determined and will do whatever it takes to get them access to the most rewarding outcomes.\n\nThe Rat Terrier loves to keep watch, and this makes them more likely to bark to alert you of potential danger (in their eyes). To avoid them causing too much of a racket when the mail arrives, introduce some training to help reduce barking at the doorbell, especially if it becomes a bit of a nuisance or puts off approaching guests.\n\nWhile this friendly breed is good with kids and other dogs, it's still advisable to spend time socializing your Rat Terrier while they're a puppy so they become accustomed to meeting new people and dogs, and even cats, who they can (though not always) be trained to live with.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Rat Terrier breed typically does well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in their age and choose the formula based on their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). While there is no standard feeding chart, your veterinarian can help you determine the best amount of food, and how often your pup should be eating, to meet your dog's unique nutrition needs.\n\nLike many other small dogs, Rat Terriers are prone to obesity and can easily gain weight if they don't get enough exercise or eat too many calories. And yes, treats count as calories!\n\nIt's hard to resist that face when they're begging for more snacks, and of course, treats can be an important part of your little friend's training regimen. Just be careful about overdoing it, because obesity can lead to health issues like heart disease and diabetes. You'll also want to make sure you're feeding your Rattie foods that are safe for dogs and know what human food your dog should never eat. If you notice your dog gaining unnecessary weight, consult your veterinarian.",
  "exercise_description": "Rat Terriers have a lot of energy, but they don't need a lot of exercise every day. You can typically satisfy their wiggles with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. But, if you're an active person always on the go, they're more than happy to go with you. If sitting on the couch watching movies sounds fun, better move over to share your popcorn—after you've taken your daily walk, of course.\n\nIf you don't get their daily walk or run in, these pups can get destructive and turn to chewing shoes or barking when bored. If it's raining or snowing out, all is not lost! Indoor games of fetch or or hide-and-seek are fun ways to satisfy their need for play. Bonus points if you can provide lots of mental stimulation during playtime. Hey, letting them tug on a rope while you watch TV counts!\n\nIf you involve them in dog sports, such as agility, they will thrive with this high level of activity and are impressive athletes. Just make sure you're then giving them plenty of rest to recover. They also enjoy splashing in water, so think about taking a day trip to the coast or a lake if there isn't a body of water close home. You can keep them safe by investing in a dog life jacket.\n\nEnclosed spaces are safest for Ratties since they're prone to chasing a small animal at Mach 3 due to their high prey drive. They also love digging holes, so make sure that fence is extra-secure before setting them free. To make sure your beloved Rat Terrier stays safe when they're not fenced in, keep them on a leash.",
  "ideal_environment": "Rat Terriers are social butterflies, and they aren't keen on being left alone for long periods. They do great in families who will include four-legged members in their activities. If weekend hikes and daily neighborhood strolls are your jam, a Rat Terrier is the one for you. Got a lot of love to go around? Even better.\n\nAs long as they are raised with children, they do well co-habitating with them. Though if you have small kids, you might be better off getting the standard size Rat Terrier. This size can withstand a little more durability during playtime. As with any dog breed, it's best to supervise when your two- and four-legged babies are interacting. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\n\nEach Rat Terrier is going to have their own temperament, but they generally can do well living with both cats and other dogs as long as they have been properly socialized from a young age.\n\nRat Terriers also fit right in whether you live in an apartment or wide-open farm land.",
  "health_description": "Rat Terriers have a decent life expectancy and can live 12-18 years. They tend to be a very healthy and active breed, but, like all dogs, they are prone to certain health problems. It’s good to know ahead of time what these concerns could be so you can look out for any tell-tale signs. \r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: This often-genetic condition can occur when the hip joints are loose, causing pain, cartilage loss and scar tissue if not addressed. Treatment options include weight management, physical therapy or surgery. \r\n \t• Patellar Luxation: This causes the kneecap to dislocate, resulting in pain and loss of function. It can be genetic and treatment option include joint supplements, pain medication and, in severe cases, surgery.  \r\n \t• Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: The hip joint is formed from the ball and socket. In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, the ball, or top of the femur bone, starts to deteriorate, which can be very painful. Surgery is often the treatment of choice.  \r\n \t• Heart Disease: Heart problems can be common when raising a Rat Terrier into their senior years. Your veterinarian will want to monitor their heart for any concerns so that if there’s an issue with their heart or the heart valves that pump blood, these can be addressed. If your vet hears a heart murmur, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the underlying cause.  \r\n \t• Eye Disease: Rat Terriers are prone to a certain disease called primary lens luxation that can lead to teary, red and/or cloudy looking eyes. Eventually, dogs can go blind. If you notice any of these signs or have concerns about your pet’s eyes or vision, please contact your vet immediately.",
  "history_description": "Rat Terriers earned their name through history by being experts at catching rats. They originated on American farms, where these little dogs were perfect for exterminating the vermin that could potentially wreak havoc on stored food needed for survival. In fact, they were specifically bred for this very task and in the 1910s and 1920s, they were the most common farm dog in the US.\r\n\r\nThe Rat Terrier dog breed comes from a mix of several different breed types, including the Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound and Beagle. Farmers used different combinations of breeds to land on the traits they required for the job. For instance, Whippets and Italian Greyhounds were included for their speed and the Beagle for their superior hunting skills. An American original, it's said Teddy Roosevelt is responsible for naming this breed.\r\n\r\nAs farmers started killing rats with poison, Rat Terriers became less popular until the 1990s when they started making a comeback. The Rattie was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2006.\r\n\r\nWant a Rat Terrier? You can find a list of reputable Rat Terrier breeders on the AKC's website. What's the average cost of a Rat Terrier puppy? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend $500-$1,100 for a Rattie pup. Puppies bred through a reputable breeder will have their puppies screened for any concerns medically and behaviorally and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Rat Terrier rescue organizations to adopt a Rattie, keep an eye out for them at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
