  "breed_intro": "Labradoodles are a cross between two of the smartest, most beloved breeds: the Poodle and the Labrador Retriever. It’s no wonder these dogs are so popular!\n\nIf you love to spend your free time taking hikes, going on runs, or exploring the outdoors, you’ll love having a Labradoodle as a companion. Their love of play and exercise will keep you busy thinking up new adventures. Your dog will be the center of attention with their big personality and irresistibly curly coat that’s sure to win over new admirers with every outing. \n\nHere’s another perk of bringing home a Labradoodle puppy: Thanks to their Poodle genes, Labradoodles are commonly considered hypoallergenic dogs. So if you tend to sneeze or itch around pups, they might be your perfect match.\n\nThe exact combination of Lab and Poodle will play a role in your dog’s appearance and personality:\r\n\n\t• A Labradoodle puppy who has a Labrador parent and a Poodle parent is considered an F1 Labradoodle—an even 50-50 mix.\nAn F1b Labradoodle has a Labradoodle parent and a Poodle parent. This makes them more likely to take on Poodle-specific traits, like a curly coat.\nF2 Labradoodles are crosses of two F1 Labradoodle parents. Characteristics are harder to predict in F2 Labradoodle puppies.",
  "appearance_description": "Labradoodles come in two sizes, depending on whether they share DNA with a Standard Poodle or a Miniature Poodle.\n\nBecause they’re a mixed breed with no set breed standard, there’s no way to know 100% what your Labradoodle puppy will grow to look like. For example, they can be a wide range of colors and have a coat that’s either long and wavy, or tight and curly.\n\n“The biggest predictability of that will be looking at the parents,” says Brian Faulkner, BVMS, associate professor at Nottingham University.\n\nBut in general, Labradoodles have bright, friendly eyes; a round button nose; and floppy ears.",
  "temperament_description": "Labradoodles are among the most popular doodle dogs, and it’s easy to see why. Jovial and fun-loving, Labradoodles make great family dogs and outgoing companions. \n\nThough a Labradoodle’s personality varies from pup to pup, they have a reputation for being playful, friendly, and affectionate. Dr. Faulkner says that dogs with more Labrador DNA may be a bit more laid back, while Labradoodles who take after their Poodle side (F1b Labradoodles) are often more exuberant and quirky. \n\nLabradoodles love to be in the company of their family, and do well with other animals and kids. They crave lots of attention, and if they’re bored or understimulated, Labradoodles may complain by barking. This is especially true for those with heavier Poodle traits.\n\nBut Poodles and Labrador Retrievers are both people-pleasers, which makes them eager to learn. With patience and positive reinforcement, you can teach your dog to be alone, which can reduce barking and anxiety.\n\nLabrador Retrievers and Poodles are both skilled working dogs originally bred to hunt. So, it makes sense that the Labradoodle—who was also bred for work (more on that later)—is up for almost any activity. Playing fetch at the park? They’re always game. Competing in dog sports like agility trials and dock diving? They’ll be a star.",
  "care_description": "As an upbeat social butterfly, a Labradoodle needs lots of attention and playtime from their favorite person. (That’s you!) Don’t overlook grooming as part of your doting care: Depending on the type of coat your Labradoodle pup inherits, they’ll need lots of brushing and regular haircuts.",
  "grooming_description": "Because Labradoodles are a crossbreed, their coats (and therefore, their grooming needs) vary.\n\nThose with predominant Poodle genes might have a longer, heavier coat that requires frequent brushing and regular haircuts, says Angela Sexton, a national certified master groomer (NCMG) and owner of Fuzzy Butts, LLC, in Cincinnati. Labradoodle dogs with more dominant Labrador genes tend to have shorter, shaggier coats that are easier to maintain. \n\nOn average, Labradoodles need grooming every four to eight weeks, Sexton says. Their grooming routine should include a bath and blow dry, a nail trim, an ear cleaning, and a haircut if necessary. At-home upkeep, like brushing them with a slicker brush, might be needed between appointments.\n\nIt’s best that Labradoodle puppies are exposed to grooming early. This gives your puppy a chance to acclimate to the sounds and stimuli (like a blow dryer) that are common during grooming. \n\n“They are a dog that's going to need grooming their whole entire life,” she says. “So if they're afraid of it early on, then you're going to have a dog that's going to cause a lot of behavior issues as the time goes on.”",
  "training_description": "Labrador Retrievers and Poodles are two of the smartest dog breeds. So naturally, the Labradoodle is bright, eager to please, and can pick up training cues quickly.\n\nLabradoodles were also originally bred to work as guide dogs, so following instructions comes naturally for them. This makes the Labradoodle a great pick for first-time pet parents.\n\nIt’s important to train your Labradoodle puppy at a young age so they can develop good manners and healthy social skills. Use positive reinforcement such as treats or toys to reward good behaviors.\n\nAlong with teaching your puppy important behavior cues, training is a great way to give your Labradoodle the mental and physical stimulation this breed craves.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Nutrition plays a big role in an animal’s quality of life, so feed your Labradoodle dog a high-quality commercial dog food that meets AAFCO standards.\n\nChoose a food based on your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), and follow the feeding instructions on the package unless otherwise instructed by your veterinarian. Most adult Labradoodles do best when fed twice a day.\n\nLabrador Retrievers love food and tend to eat quickly, which can cause digestion issues. If you notice your Labradoodle has inherited this trait, Dr. Faulkner recommends using a slow feeder bowl to slow down their eating.",
  "exercise_description": "Schedule at least one hour of exercise every day with your Labradoodle. A couple of neighborhood walks can work in a pinch, but make sure to mix it up, too. Labradoodles need mental stimulation and social time; they want to engage with you, not just be left to run around the yard alone.\n\n“It's not just exercise in terms of distance walk,” Dr. Faulkner says. “It's the entertainment and engagement that … the breed prefers.”\n\nHere are some activities to add to your to-do list with your Labradoodle: go for a run, explore the outdoors on a hiking trail, play fetch in the backyard, go swimming, or learn a new dog sport.",
  "ideal_environment": "Most Labradoodles are silly, fun-loving dogs who are a joy to live with as long as their basic needs are met. They’re high-energy and social, so they thrive in active homes with families who can give them plenty of time and attention.\n\nThey’d rather be with you than left alone, so Labradoodles prefer pet parents who are willing to bring them along on errands and outings.\n\nNo matter a Labradoodle’s size, they can do well in apartments as long as they get out to stretch their legs every day. But in general, Mini Labradoodles (those with Miniature Poodle lineage) need less space than Standard Labradoodles.\n\nThe breed is usually great with kids and four-legged family members alike. Training and socialization will help your Labradoodle puppy grow into a polite and well-behaved member of the family.",
  "health_description": "Both Poodles and Labrador Retrievers are generally healthy breeds, and the same goes for Labradoodles.\n\n“As a vet and owner of two Labradoodles myself, I don't see too many [health] issues,” Dr. Faulkner says. He notes that skin conditions and orthopedic diseases tend to be the most common when he does see a Labradoodle patient.\n\nThe typical Labradoodle lifespan is 12–15 years, and watching for signs of common health issues will help your pup live a long and happy life. Here’s what to look out for.\r\n\n\t• Hip dysplasia: Larger dogs (like Standard Labradoodles) are prone to orthopedic issues such as hip dysplasia, a condition where the hip joint doesn’t fit together properly. This causes pain and (if left untreated) arthritis in dogs. Treatment may include pain medication, joint supplements, physical therapy, and (in some cases) surgery. \nElbow dysplasia: Like hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia is an orthopedic condition where the elbow joint doesn’t develop as it should, leading to pain and arthritis. This condition can cause swelling, lameness, limping, and decreased range of motion. Surgery is often recommended for dogs with elbow dysplasia. \nSkin conditions: Labradoodles can have thick, curly hair as part of their Poodle DNA. While this trait is an adorable part of the breed, it also makes them more prone to skin conditions such as sebaceous adenitis, an autoimmune disease that causes the skin’s oil glands to inflame. Watch for symptoms such as dryness, hair loss, and excessive licking or scratching.\nEye issues: Your Labradoodle may be susceptible to eye issues, including the following:\r\n\n\t• Glaucoma: A painful condition where pressure builds in the eyes from undrained fluid\nProgressive retinal atrophy: An inherited, painless eye disease that leads to blindness \nCataracts: A hazy clouding on the lens of the eye that hinders vision",
  "history_description": "Before Labradoodles became designer dogs, they were working dogs.\n\nThe first Labradoodle puppies were bred in 1989 by Wally Conron, a breeder who worked with the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia. A blind woman in Hawaii had contacted the organization and asked for a service dog who wouldn’t trigger her husband’s allergies.\n\nConron thought of the Standard Poodle, a breed known for being hypoallergenic. Combined with the friendly and trainable personality of the Labrador Retriever—already a reliable guide dog breed—Conron hoped to create a breed that could serve as excellent guide dogs for people with both vision impairment and allergies. \n\nThe first known litter included a Labradoodle puppy named Sultan, who became a successful guide dog for the woman in Hawaii.\n\nBut when Conron tried to find work for the remaining Labradoodle puppies, he found that people weren’t interested in trusting a crossbreed as their service dog. Up to this point, crossbreeds were not popular. So in an attempt to make his breed more appealing, Conron gave them a special name. \n\n“He made them sound more unique than simply referring to them as a ‘crossbreed’ by using a combination of names,” Dr. Faulkner says. “And of course, this idea has caught on with many crosses over the last 10–15 years.”\n\nThe Labradoodle rebrand was a success, and the breed’s popularity took off. Today, the Labradoodle is one of the most popular designer dog breeds, although they’re not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).\n\nCurious about where you can find a Labradoodle to call your own? Look for reputable breeders with healthy, happy, outgoing dogs. Labradoodle price points can range from $1,000–$4,000, and depend on factors such as age and generation.\n\nIf you’re looking to cut down on the cost or support dogs in special need of a home, you can look for Labradoodle rescue dogs instead. Check Labradoodle rescue sites such as IDOG Rescue, Inc., for Labradoodle adoption opportunities, or call your local shelter to see if there are any doodles available.",
