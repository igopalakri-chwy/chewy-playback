  "breed_intro": "The Lakeland Terrier is curious, bold and loves to play. Lakies, as they're affectionately known, enjoy a good adventure. These curious pups never leave a good mystery unsolved, whether that's an interesting scent on a nature hike or a puzzle toy they know is hiding a delicious treat. Lakies love to be busy, but once they've solved today's mystery, they're cool to hang out on the patio with you and recount their discoveries—and maybe snack on a treat or two.",
  "appearance_description": "The Lakeland Terrier's square-set jaw, sturdy build and twinkling eyes let you know right away that their small size is no indication of a lack of personality. With a wispy, wiry coat and distinguished beard, this handsome pup is full of charm and character.",
  "temperament_description": "Lakeland Terriers are feisty pups who look forward to adventures with you. With their intelligence and curious nature, Lakies really enjoy exploring, whether that's a walk in the neighborhood or a hike down a wooded path where they can run on a leash and discover scents with their nose.\n\nPlenty of play that exercises their minds and bodies will keep them happy, content and out of mischief. They're known to create their own entertainment if they get bored, like digging holes in the yard. (Didn't you want that new bush over here?)\n\nLakeland Terriers love their families and are great playmates for children. However, socialization starting when they're a puppy is important to help these pups get used to kids. Lakies can be wary of strangers and may feel the need to protect their food or toys, or feel threatened if they're being cornered. So, they may misinterpret a toddler's exuberant, quick movements and react. It's important to supervise all playtimes with your dog and small kids, and teach every child in your dog's life how to play nicely with your pup.\n\nLakies can get along with other dogs they've grown up with, but they might never be a cat's BFF. Lakelands have a strong prey drive to chase cats and other small pets, like rabbits or gerbils.\n\nThese confident pups make great watch dogs. Lakies are quick to bark at new sights and sounds—whether they see a squirrel in the backyard or a guest approaching the home.\n\nTheir confident and independent nature likely comes from their fox-hunting history. They started out as farm dogs raised to guard sheep, and the foxes they chased were often bigger than them. Now, that's a confident pup!",
  "care_description": "Despite a Lakeland Terrier's independent nature, they do need their pet parents for a few key things—including consistent grooming, training and exercise—to look, feel and behave their best.",
  "grooming_description": "Lakeland Terriers have fairly high grooming requirements compared to other breeds, although their needs are pretty typical of double-coated, wire-haired dogs.\n\nA regular grooming schedule complete with 15 to 30 minutes of brushing once a week—or more frequently for active dogs who spend a good amount of time outdoors digging in the dirt—keeps them less scraggly and more show-ring ready. A slicker brush and metal comb combo work well to remove dead hair, and special attention should be paid to the tufts on the face and legs to prevent matting. When properly groomed, Lakies are a low-shedding breed. While you're at it, check their ears every week for debris and signs of infection (redness, swelling, bad odor). If you notice anything unusual, contact your vet, who may advise you to clean their ears. To keep their coats shiny, they should be bathed every four to six weeks.\n\nTo clip or not to clip—that is the question. If you want to show your Lakeland Terrier, you'll need to hand strip the coat three to four times a year. Hand stripping is a grooming technique in which hair is manually plucked. You could also clip your dog, but to keep their characteristic cut, you'll only clip certain parts of the body. Chat with your vet, a professional groomer or a breed expert about what's best for your pup and lifestyle.\n\nIf you want to keep their signature rectangular-shaped profile, you'll need to use grooming scissors to carefully trim facial hair to keep their handsome head of hair dapper. And their nails should be trimmed when they start making that \"click-clack\" noise as your Lakie scuttles across hardwood floors (about once a month or so).\n\nMost vets recommend you brush your dog's teeth daily. This important practice helps keep dental disease, periodontal problems and bad breath at bay. Starting your pup on the practice at a young age is the best way to acclimate them. Your terrier's teeth should also be professionally cleaned once a year by your vet.",
  "training_description": "Training a Lakeland Terrier puppy should involve positive reinforcement, an emphasis on socialization with other dogs and people, and reward-based tactics to encourage preferred behaviors over less-desirable ones (like excessive barking). Lakeland Terriers may respond well to training exercises disguised as playful games that get their mental gears going. Even a well-trained Lakie should be kept on a leash in public due to their strong prey drive and chasing instincts.\r\n\r\nTo help socialize your Lakie, take your puppy on walks and get them used to seeing people and other dogs in the area. Consider signing your pup up for puppy preschool. This is a great place for them to learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people (who are not so strange after all) in one location.\r\n\r\nInitial training sessions may be kept relatively short and should not be so repetitive you bore this highly intelligent dog. Be sure to reward their efforts with treats, praise and play breaks with fun toys. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries for your Lakie to get the hang of a task or command; it's not that they don't understand, they're just reluctant to give up their rebel-hearted ways. But with practice and commitment to a positive attitude, you'll prevail—eventually.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Lakeland Terriers typically thrive on a diet of high-quality dog food that fits your pet's stage of life (puppy, adult or senior). Be sure to look for a statement on the packaging that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nThe Lakeland Terrier breed may become overweight if they eat more calories than they burn. As you plan mealtime, be sure to include the treats you give in your food count. Even an extra pound or two can adversely affect your pup's health and cause issues down the line. If you see your pup gaining extra weight, contact your vet. They can advise you about the best diet for your pet's individual needs and lifestyle.",
  "exercise_description": "Lakies thrive when they have access to wide, open spaces—or at least a big backyard. They need a lot of daily activity (at least 45 minutes of high energy activity), and pet parents should beware that if these pups can't expend their considerable energy outside, they'll take their frustration out in some pretty inventive ways, like digging holes in your yard or chasing the neighbor's cat who finds their way into your backyard.\r\n\r\nShort walks on a leash aren't really enough exercise for Lakies; they need the chance to tire themselves out, whether through vigorous play sessions or as your jogging buddy. They make great playmates for kids, but you may want to avoid the dog park until you fully understand your pet's temperament and know how they respond to other dogs.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to exercise their minds, too. Lakies are curious dogs who need mental stimulation to keep their brains engaged. This can take the form of dog sports, like agility, tracking and obedience, or it can be dog puzzles left around the house or other games you create for your pup to solve.",
  "ideal_environment": "Although Lakeland Terriers like to speed around a yard or larger house, apartment living is doable. In smaller square-footage scenarios, pet parents need to commit to providing their pup with the activity and mental stimulation they crave on a daily basis. Otherwise, you may witness the scope of mischief this breed is capable of. (But lazy Saturdays have never been a thing with you, right?) Pro tip: These escape artists need a home that's been \"terrier-proofed\" to ensure there are no fence gaps or small spaces your pup can squeeze through or tunnel under.\n\nLakies thrive best with active pet parents, and they're a good fit for families with kids who want a spunky playmate. Although they tend to be more tolerant of canine companions than other terrier types are, families with other dogs in the house should handle introductions carefully. In some cases, this approach also applies to human guests, around whom your Lakeland Terrier may be cautious, at least at first. But proper and early socialization can help a Lakie be more comfortable around new people and dogs.\n\nThe Lakeland Terrier's double coat is designed to regulate their body temperature, so they aren't particularly sensitive to heat or cold. But as with any dog, care should be taken in especially hot or cold climates. Your Lakie should always have access to plenty of fresh water if they're out playing in the heat of the day.",
  "health_description": "Lakeland Terriers have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years, and these pups aren’t as popular as some of their cousins. Because they’re not bred as frequently, they have fewer health issues than some other terrier breeds. Being aware of their most common medical concerns can help your pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Hypothyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones. Luckily, this is typically easily treated by giving your dog thyroid medication every day. When detected early, it usually doesn’t impact the animal’s quality of life.\nEye Problems: Lakeland Terriers’ eyes can be susceptible to issues like lens luxation (an inherited eye condition) and distichiasis (unusual hair growth in the eye area). Glaucoma and cataracts may also be common in older Lakies. If your pup is having any issues with their eyes (redness, cloudiness, bulging, squinting or pain), see your vet immediately. Depending on the underlying problem, they may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist for advanced diagnostics or treatment options.\nLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This inherited hip disease occurs due to deterioration of the ball portion (femoral head) of the hip socket. This painful condition is often treated with surgery.\nvon Willebrand’s Disease (vWB): This inherited bleeding disorder causes the dog’s blood not to clot properly. Most affected dogs live normal day-to-day lives, but unexpected bleeding can occur during surgery, even routine procedures. Genetic screening testing is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "The Lakeland Terrier is named for the Lake District of Northern England, where they were bred as farmers' dogs and tasked with critical jobs like protecting land and sheep, keeping farms free from pests and hunting foxes. The breed's hard-working attitude persists today, as does their fearlessness, pride and intelligence.\r\n\r\nA few other terrier breeds have similar origin stories: You'd be forgiven for confusing the Lakeland Terrier with their slightly larger cousin, the Welsh Terrier—similar in disposition and physical characteristics, the two are sometimes mixed up for each other. (Hint: The Welsh Terrier is slightly larger and is only black and tan. Lakies come in more color options.)\r\n\r\nThanks to their confident poise and undeniable handsomeness, Lakies can make excellent show dogs. In fact, in 1967 a Lakeland Terrier—Champion Stingray of Derryabah—was the first dog to win Best in Show at both Crufts and Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Lakeland Terrier dog in 1934. Are you looking to add a like Lakie love in your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC website. Lakeland Terrier puppy price ranges from $1,200 to $1,800. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, contact the United States Lakeland Terrier Club for rescue pups, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
