  "breed_intro": "The heart of a warrior beats strongly in this little pup. The Dachshund is on alert and will give you regular updates on what's happening on the block'whether it's a squirrel or a neighbor passing by. However, their serious soldier side disappears when you're ready to play hide-and-seek with their favorite treats. But watch out'they'll try to tell you how the game should be played. And at the end of a hard day of keeping your home safe and secure, they choose to reward themselves with snuggle time next to their favorite person'you, of course!",
  "appearance_description": "Dachshunds' proud eyes reflect the confidence they carry in every small step. These \"wiener dogs\" make up for their diminutive size and short legs with a huge dose of bravery. Their appearance can vary depending on whether they have a short, sleek coat; a wiry coat; or a long coat. They can also have a variety of patterns and colors in their coats, ranging from black to chocolate, red, blue or gold, with tan or cream markings. Every Dachshund dog has an adorably courageous demeanor, always ready to defend the honor of their loved ones.",
  "temperament_description": "Dachshunds may look playful and cute, but their little hearts carry the bravery of a strong soldier. They're loyal to a fault to their human family, but they don't always get along so well with other dogs or cats.\r\n\r\nBecause of their fragile backs and protective personalities, they do better in homes without young kids and babies. A child who plays too roughly could seriously injure your Doxie, so early socialization, training and supervision with small kids and babies are important.\r\n\r\nThese small-sized but confident pups love to bark, so while they can be just fine in a small or large home, they might not be the best choice for apartment living. And if you have a yard, be warned: Dachshunds were bred to keep badgers off property, so they'll chase any small animals in your yard and may dig a few holes to search for critters underground.\r\n\r\nDachshunds are smart problem solvers who might figure out a way to get at your uneaten food if you leave it out too long. While they aren't couch potatoes, they also aren't hyperactive; they'll enjoy a moderate walk with you every day.\r\n\r\nIn the right home, these sausage dogs are a joy. Be ready for quite a few laughs when you have a playful Dachshund. They might even steal the socks right off your feet from time to time.",
  "care_description": "Dachshunds are playful and adorable, but they must be handled with care due to their fragile spines. They don't need to be bathed often, but their bellies may need more frequent brushing because their bodies are so close to the ground and can pick up stickers or burrs. Because they may be quicker to bite than some other dog breeds, it's important to not only introduce Dachshunds slowly to anyone new but also provide early socialization, training and supervision with small kids and babies. These family dogs are happiest with scent-focused games to play and loving humans to relax with in a quiet home.",
  "grooming_description": "A Dachshund's brushing needs vary depending on which type of coat they have:\n\n \tA short-haired Dachshund can be brushed when needed, but you'll want to wipe their fur regularly with a hound glove.\n \tLong-haired and wire-haired varieties are more likely to get mats or tangles, so they should be brushed at least once a week, but a few times a week is ideal. A slicker brush will help get the tangles out, then use a bristle brush to keep the coat shiny.\n\nBecause Dachshunds' bodies are low to the ground, they may need extra brushing if they've been outside to remove burrs or stickers.\n\nThankfully, shedding isn't a big issue with Doxies. You won't have a hair-free home, but they shed much less than longer-haired breeds, like Huskies.\n\nAs for bathing, you only need to bathe your Dachshund once every few months, although longer-haired varieties may need a bath once a month. Of course, if your pup is outside and rolls in something stinky, you might want to make an exception!\n\nThe Dachshund breed is more likely to develop tartar than other breeds, so, it's important you brush their teeth every day. Start brushing their teeth while they're puppies to get them used to the experience. If you're not sure how to brush their teeth, your veterinarian can teach you. Also, remember to get their teeth professionally cleaned by your vet once a year.\n\nDachshunds need their nails trimmed about once a month; you'll know it's time when you hear them tapping on your hardwood floors. This may be difficult for some pet parents to do, but your groomer or vet can help.",
  "training_description": "Dachshunds thrive with positive reinforcement training. This method uses special treats, toys and lots of praise to motivate the pup. Because they can sometimes be stubborn, it's best to keep the training sessions short. Use treats they absolutely love to help keep them excited about learning. If they lose patience and get distracted by a sound or smell, just let them wander away and continue their training later.\n\nDoxies also have a powerful nose, so they respond well to any scent-based game. Play hide-and-go-seek with treats to grab their attention and give them much-needed mental stimulation.\n\nIt's a good idea to start socializing your Doxie as a puppy. Early socialization helps them get used to having other people and dogs around, and group obedience classes are a good place to start. Doxies do well with older children, but young children will need to be supervised when your dog is in the room. And while they do OK with other dogs in the home, they often prefer to be your one-and-only pup.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Dachshunds typically do well with a high-quality, commercial dog food. Make sure the food you choose meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials. (Look for the AAFCO statement on the package.) Factor in your dog's age and use a nutrition formula designed for their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior dog. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog.\n\nYou'll also want to consider their activity level when choosing how much to feed them each day. It's important that your Dachshund doesn't become overweight since they are short with long backs. Also, the extra pounds can exacerbate any back problems. (Dachshunds are prone to spinal issues.) Be sure to keep track of the treats you give them (snack calories count, too!), so you don't accidentally overfeed them.\n\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the best food and diet for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Dachshunds have moderate energy levels, so their exercise needs aren't as intense as some other breeds. They do, however, need activities that avoid putting stress on their fragile backs. Walking your dog every day (about 30 minutes) at an easy-going speed, along with daily play and training, is really all your pup needs. Avoid intense exercises that includes jumping or rough play since this can exacerbate their back issues and possibly aggravate any cases of intervertebral disk disease.\r\n\r\nDachshunds were bred as hunting dogs for badgers, so they'll love participating in sports like Earthdog, where they hunt rodents in tunnels. (The rodents are kept safe from the dogs during the sport.) If they're left alone in a yard, they'll gravitate toward this instinct by hunting any small-sized animal they see and digging lots of holes, so it's best if you can give them a healthy outlet for their digging instincts instead.",
  "ideal_environment": "Dachshunds thrive in quieter homes where they have quality time with their humans and soak up all of their love and attention. They also thrive with pet parents who can provide regular walks. They need a moderate amount of exercise without any rough play, because they can suffer back issues. For households with young children, teach them how to properly interact with dogs (again, no rough play!) and supervise them when they're together. With proper socialization and introductions, Dachshunds can learn to get along with other pets, too.\r\n\r\nAlthough experienced pup parents might do best with Dachshunds, a first-time pup parent will be just fine as long as they do their research first. These loving dogs can be equally happy in a small or large home, as long as they have daily walks and lots of time with you.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dachshunds are smart, confident and loyal. If they think something is amiss, they'll let you know. And even though they love outings that challenge them mentally and physically, they also love to snuggle up with you at the end of each day.",
  "health_description": "Dachshunds have a lifespan of 12-16 years, but the breed does have a few health issues you'll want to watch for. To reduce the odds  of health problems, work with a Dachshund breeder who screens for these issues and ask to see the test results of the litter and parents you're considering.\r\n\r\n \tBack Issues: Dachshunds are prone to back problems that can lead to paralysis if not treated promptly. This includes intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), caused by a bulging or slipped disc. As many as 25 percent of Dachshunds may have IVDD at some point. If you notice any change in your dog's movement or trouble walking, talk to your veterinarian right away. Depending on the severity, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory may be all that's needed. There are several steps you can take to help safeguard your Dachshund's back: Avoid any rough play or jumping; always carry your dog by supporting their hind end with one hand and chest with the other; keep them a lean, healthy weight; and set up ramps or stairs, so they don't have to jump on the furniture.\r\n \tBloat: Dachshunds can develop gastric torsion or bloat, where the stomach twists on itself. Symptoms can include being in pain, pacing, drooling, trying to throw up but not being able to or licking their lips. This can come on fast, and it is life-threatening, so you'll need to get your dog to a veterinarian quickly if you notice symptoms.\r\n \tDeafness: If your Dachshund's parents are both dapples (the coat is mottled with patches of color), your pup has a greater chance of being deaf. While there is no cure, deaf pups can live a very happy life.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: This occurs when a kneecap slips out of its normal position. You may notice this issue if your dog does a little skip sometimes when walking. Some dogs may not need any treatment, while others may need surgery, depending on the severity. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can help prevent this issue.\r\n \tEpilepsy: Dachshunds can also have epilepsy, which is typically a genetic issue. Medications may be needed for more severe cases. Breeders will screen for this issue to prevent passing the condition on to future generations of Doxies.\r\n \tEye Problems: Dachshunds can have eye problems, including cataracts, glaucoma or progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). All three can cause blindness. Cataracts and glaucoma may be treated with surgery. PRA is not treatable; however, most dogs adjust to life with vision loss. Your veterinarian can watch for these issues, and breeders may be able to screen for them.",
  "history_description": "Dachshunds' origin dates back more than 600 years ago to Germany where they were bred to hunt badgers. In fact, their name is German for \"badger dog.\" Their narrow, low-to-the-ground body is perfect for digging into badger tunnels, and their confident, brave personalities make them mighty hunters. They were also bred to have a loud bark to alert their humans whenever they found badgers underground. Sometimes, packs of Dachshunds were used for hunting wild boar.\r\n\r\nDoxies were bred for three different types of coats depending on their climate. Their original coat was short and smooth. Some were bred to have longer coats for colder climates, and others were bred to have wiry coats to help them avoid thorns when they worked in regions with brier patches.\r\n\r\nDachshunds were first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. But during World War I, they were used in German propaganda. As a result, the AKC temporarily rebranded them as Badger Dogs or Liberty Pups in the United States. Today, they're widely beloved dogs. There are numerous clubs dedicated to them, including the Dachshund Club of America.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find a Dachshund puppy today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The average Dachshund price can be anywhere from $200 to more than $3,500 for a Dachshund puppy, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. Dachshund rescue organizations and local shelters can also help you find a purebred to adopt. You can also search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are Dachshunds hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Dachshunds are not hypoallergenic. However, short-haired Dachshunds tend to have less dander than the other two coat varieties, so they may cause fewer allergies in people allergic to dander. But \"allergy-free\" is not a Dachshund trait."
