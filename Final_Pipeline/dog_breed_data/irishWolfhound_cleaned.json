  "breed_intro": "If you’ve ever dreamed of being friends with Chewbacca, you’re in luck: Being BFFs with an Irish Wolfhound, a gentle giant of the canine world, might be the next best thing. This pup will be as loyal to you as Chewy was to Han Solo. \n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to literally see eye-to-eye with your dog … this is about as close as you’re going to get. (Irish Wolfhounds are at least 30 inches tall—that’s nearly 3 feet!) And while they sometimes get preoccupied in their own little world, Irish Wolfhounds are devoted besties who might forget how big they are when they go in for snuggles; but that just makes it cozier, right?",
  "appearance_description": "Strong and elegant, the Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all the dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). Even though their size might be a little intimidating, these gentle giants are lovers at heart.",
  "temperament_description": "These calm, friendly pups are big softies at heart. When you bring home an Irish Wolfhound puppy, you’ve found a lifelong best friend.   \n\nBut despite their devotion, an Irish Wolfhound’s sight hound instincts sometimes convince them that their agenda—like napping, counter surfing, or watching squirrels—is the most important thing in the world. An experienced pet parent can teach them that sometimes it’s good to follow a healthy routine.  \n\nWhen trained and well-socialized, Irish Wolfhounds can adapt to life with other pets. But due to their ancestral sight hound instinct, they might not do well around cats, but this depends on the individual dog and whether they were properly introduced to feline friends. \n\nIrish Wolfhounds generally love interacting with children but are better suited for families with older kids, as your giant pup may accidentally bump into a little kiddo or inadvertently knock them over when playing.   \n\nThis calm breed is athletic and loves to run, but they can also be talented couch potatoes if you let them.",
  "care_description": "The Irish Wolfhound is a whole lot of dog—even Irish Wolfhound puppies are big compared with most other breeds.   \n\nTheir size impacts everything from diet to training. But their grooming needs aren’t as outsized as their body, and Irish Wolfhounds tend to be light shedders.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Bathe your Irish Wolfhound every four to six weeks. Stock up on dog shampoo—you’ll need to use a lot to lather the fur on their supersized build. \nBrushing: Brush your pup at least weekly so their coats don’t get matted. Unlike many double-coated breeds, Irish Wolfhounds don’t blow their coats (that is, shed heavily) during any particular season. Instead, they shed lightly all year round.  \r\n\n\t• A rake brush will keep their hair from getting tangled; follow up with a pin brush afterward.  \r\n\nDental care: Brushing your dog’s teeth every day is the best way to prevent dental disease. Begin brushing your Irish Wolfhound puppy’s teeth when they’re young so they get used to the routine. Along with at-home brushing, get a professional cleaning at the vet once a year.  \nNail care: Trim their nails every four to six weeks.",
  "training_description": "When it comes to training Irish Wolfhounds, start early. They aren’t always easy to train, but that’s not because they lack intelligence (they very smart dogs!). Rather, those big brains might make them become bored of repeating cues.   \n\nThe best way to convince them to follow your lead is through positive reinforcement—reward their good behavior with treats, toys, and praise. \n\nIrish Wolfhounds are very bright, but without consistent obedience training, their independence may win over their intelligence and get them into mischief. Cues like sit, stay, and come are good places to start, along with teaching them how to walk nicely on a leash.  \n\nYou’ll also want to socialize your Irish Wolfhound puppy when they’re young. Get them out into the world meeting new people and doing new things as early as your vet says it’s OK. One way to prioritize socialization is enrolling your extra-large puppy in puppy school. They’ll learn to play nicely with other dogs and meet new people.  \n\nIf you adopt an Irish Wolfhound when they’re older, ask your vet for the best way to go about acclimating them to their new life. Either way, keep initial public outings short, frequent, and positive so your Irish Wolfhound has good associations with the outside world.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Irish Wolfhounds typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Choose a formula that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). \n\nProper nutrition is essential for Irish Wolfhound puppies when they are growing, and they’ll need puppy food designed for large breeds. Talk to your vet about when to switch from puppy food to adult food, since Irish Wolfhound puppies grow until they’re around 2 years old. \n\nIf you decide to supplement beyond a balanced diet, chat with your vet first. While Irish Wolfhounds can benefit from some supplements, too much of certain nutrients (like calcium or fish oil) may damage their growing bones and joints.  \n\nAdult Irish Wolfhounds can quickly become overweight, which can stress their joints and lead to heart issues. Always talk with your veterinarian when making decisions about your Irish Wolfhound’s diet. They’re in the best position to help you pick the right food for your individual dog.  \n\nRemember that treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories. \n\nAnd because Irish Wolfhounds are susceptible to a life-threatening condition that can be triggered during mealtimes (more on that below), take these precautions when feeding your dog: \r\n\n\t• Offer food in a slow feeder bowl, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy to slow down your dog’s gulping. \nAvoid using elevated food bowls. \nDon’t let your pup exercise for an hour before or after eating. \nFeed your dog scheduled meals at least twice a day instead of one big meal.",
  "exercise_description": "With a stride that could be 10 feet, Irish Wolfhounds need plenty of opportunities to stretch those legs. An hour or two of daily exercise is a nonnegotiable.  \n\nThis breed’s need for speed can top out at 30 miles an hour—yep, they’re faster than you’re typically allowed to drive in a suburban neighborhood. But their galloping ways and occasional “zoomies” are more for short jaunts rather than long distances. Shorter walks of one to two miles are ideal for daily exercise. \n\nExercise is always important, but growing Irish Wolfhound puppies need special consideration. Avoid jogging with them until they’re at least 16 months old; giant dog breeds are prone to joint issues, and strenuous exercise before their bodies are fully developed can damage their joints.  \n\nStrive for a balanced approach: Allow Irish Wolfhound puppies to play on their terms, but make sure they don’t overdo it.",
  "ideal_environment": "If you have a tiny home or apartment, an Irish Wolfhound might not be your perfect match.  \n\nThese long-limbed pups do best with ample space and a fenced yard with room to run like the wind when the mood strikes. They’ll also appreciate an extra-large couch or orthopedic dog bed, as they prefer to punctuate their days with naps when they’re not out playing (it’s a solid strategy!). \n\nIf you’re an active, experienced pet parent who also enjoys frequent walks, an Irish Wolfhound is an ideal companion—though you may have trouble matching them stride for stride. (It’s OK—let them show off a bit!)  \n\nBecause Irish Wolfhounds are so tall, they may not be the best choice for homes with young kids. Your Irish Wolfhound might accidentally play too hard or bump them with a huge paw. That said, their friendly personality is a good fit for older children, and they can also be very good with other dogs, if they’re socialized.  \n\nHomes with cats or other small pets might not be ideal, since all sight hounds tend to have a high prey drive; they might chase smaller animals out of instinct.",
  "health_description": "The average Irish Wolfhound lifespan is 6–8 years. Their size makes them prone to certain health conditions, and it’s important for pet parents to know that routine vet care can quickly become expensive for this big breed.  \n\nFor example, Irish Wolfhounds will need greater quantities of certain medications—the same doses smaller dogs receive just won’t be effective. This is a good reason to consider pet insurance. \n\nHere are some health issues to be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Irish Wolfhounds are prone to a life-threatening condition called bloat that occurs when the stomach becomes distended with air and/or food. A serious complication of bloat is gastric dilatation-volvulus, when the stomach twists on itself, cutting off blood supply to the organs. Symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, excessive drooling, and dry heaving; go to the emergency vet immediately if you notice these signs.  \r\n\n\t• If you’re concerned about GDV, talk to your vet about a preventative gastropexy procedure.  \r\n\nBone cancer: More formally known as osteosarcoma, bone cancer is common in Irish Wolfhounds. Treatment often includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.  \nElbow and hip dysplasia: Elbow and hip dysplasia are genetic conditions that develop during puppyhood when the joints don’t align well and become loose. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or (in severe cases) surgery. \nHeart disease: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), or an enlarged heart, is one of the most common heart diseases in large-breed dogs. When the heart enlarges, it results in thin and weakened heart muscles, leading to heart failure.  \nLiver shunts: This is an abnormal series of blood vessels that bypass a dog’s liver, which can cause stunted growth, poor muscle development, disorientation, and seizures. There is no genetic screening test for liver shunts in dogs. Still, you can manage the condition with diet changes, antibiotics, other medications, and surgery.",
  "history_description": "The name says it all: Irish Wolfhounds are hounds with origins in Ireland, and they hunted wolves as far back as the 1400s. Honored for centuries in Irish folklore, the Irish Wolfhound size and stature made them excellent companions on quests, battles, and general adventuring.  \n\nHowever, Irish Wolfhounds may have done too good of a job: Wolves were eradicated in Ireland by the 1700s. Subsequently, the population of Irish Wolfhounds diminished, and they were in danger of extinction until there was renewed interest in preserving the breed in the 1800s, according to the Irish Wolfhound Club of America. The American Kennel Club recognized the Irish Wolfhound in 1897.  \n\nThe average Irish Wolfhound costs between $1,500–$3,500. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder.   \n\nYou can also consider Irish Wolfhound adoption. Check in at a giant-breed rescue like Just Giants or Big Dogs Huge Paws, and you can also keep an eye out at your local animal shelter or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
