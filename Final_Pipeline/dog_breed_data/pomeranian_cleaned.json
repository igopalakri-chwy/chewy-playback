  "breed_intro": "Smart yet sassy, the Pomeranian is a member of the Toy dog group due to their diminutive size, but don't be fooled by their cute, fluffy appearance'Poms pack a bigger dog's swagger into their tiny frames. These plucky pups are active, inquisitive and love to put on a show. Be prepared to get many compliments on their outgoing personality and lion-like mane. With a Pom, the whole world is their stage, and you're their biggest fan.",
  "appearance_description": "The Pomeranian is a tiny dog with a very distinct look. Their most common colors are the red-oranges of a sunset, and their fluffy fur can make them look like tiny lions. They have dark, almond-shaped eyes and alert ears set high on their fox-like head. Their expressive and feathery tail spreads over the back of their double coat.",
  "temperament_description": "Happy-go-lucky is a Pomeranian's middle name, as their personality is equal parts friendly and inquisitive. They live for social interactions and to make their pet parents laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nIf you have kids at your house, you'll be glad to learn that aggressiveness isn't typically in this dog's nature. Pomeranians aren't known to be biters, although any dog may snap if provoked. So, teach children to handle dogs with care, and keep a close eye on toddlers and preschoolers who may accidentally drop or clutch this fluffy furball too tightly'it's easy to mistake a tiny Pomeranian for a favorite stuffed animal. Still, this breed is known to be rather compatible with their extended family, whether it includes other dogs, cats or children.\r\n\r\nNot only do they have the looks, but also the smarts. Poms have competency in spades and they're adept at picking up fun new tricks. If you're hoping to try obedience classes with your Pomeranian, this breed is keenly intelligent and likely to get good grades!\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the Pomeranian excels at jobs such as work as a therapy dog and is also known to make a fine watchdog since they're not afraid to bark. And if looking absolutely adorable is considered a type of employment, then a Pom fills this requirement too'and you should hire this fur baby, pronto!\r\n\r\nPomeranians are sometimes described as cocky, which likely refers to their proud gait and bouncy personality. Smart, perky and alert to everything around them, the Pomeranian breed's generally positive temperament makes them worthy of top-dog status in many types of families.",
  "care_description": "Pomeranians may look high maintenance, but there's more to them than a fluffy fur coat. Poms are super smart and will enjoy learning new skills. They're also active little pups, but it's easy to get their exercise in'even in your own home. (After all, they have really short legs!)",
  "grooming_description": "Keeping Pomeranian haircuts looking sharp requires a good bit of sudsing, so bathe your dog in warm water every one to four weeks. Blot dry with an absorbent towel, then use a hairdryer (but never leave a dog unattended under one). Brushing their teeth a few times a week (if not daily) is recommended, as is brushing the double coat a couple of times a week to remove shedding and matted hair.\r\n\r\nA wire pin brush is ideal for a Pom's thick coat and a small size works well on their various tiny haircuts, including the Pomeranian teddy bear cut (short body hair and longer face and ear fur that's cut in a circle'aww!) and the Pomeranian lion cut, which features closely clipped body fur and long head hair shaped like a mini mane (a tiny tuft on the tail is optional, but adorable).\r\n\r\nA complete Pomeranian grooming package, which is highly recommended every four to six weeks, will include bathing, brushing and a haircut (as needed), cleaning the teeth, ears, and anal glands as well as clipping the nails. Tap a pro groomer if you're not keen to handle some areas. And you should still see your vet for professional dental cleanings.",
  "training_description": "Go to the head of the class! Sign your Pomeranian puppy up for obedience training, and they'll quickly learn how to sit, stay and speak. And make good use of a small-dog leash early on, attaching it to a halter rather than a collar. (Some Poms have tracheal issues, so a halter is safer.) The goal: taking advantage of that famous Pomeranian intelligence to teach them to walk nicely when leashed.\n\nHousebreaking is another important part of Pomeranian training, but know that accidents can happen, especially with tiny pups and their equally small bladders. Training pads are a good go-to inside. The Pet Parents washable dog pee pads with a non-slip backing, for example, are reusable and the neutral tones match most home decor.\n\nLet's talk about jumping. The \"off\" or \"down\" command is one to master right away to prevent energetic Poms from springing onto chairs, couches and beds. A Pom's \"big-dog bluster\" may lead them to think they can leap tall sofas in a single bound, but this practice could actually end with injured joints or even a broken bone.",
  "diet_nutrition": "As long as the chow you choose is complete and balanced, you can serve up either commercially prepared food or little meals you make yourself. (Just be sure to run these homemade concoctions by your vet to be sure they meet your pet's nutritional needs.) And, of course, be sure to consider your Pom's age when selecting the right kibble'which means puppy food for young dogs, adult food for adult animals, and a senior diet for your elderly Pomeranian.\n\nTreats are an important part of a dog's diet as they're necessary during training as well as to reward a very good dog when the moment arises. But don't go overboard with your handouts (or with your nightly scoops of dog dinner), as serving too-large portions can lead to an overweight Pom.\n\nAlways keep fresh water available so your pup can wet their whistle, and make a point of learning which human foods are safe to share on occasion and which are not.",
  "exercise_description": "Regular exercise is the goal for your Pomeranian (and you, too!), so get this sweet lapdog off your legs and into the backyard or to the park for some run-around time. A nice 20-minute walk a couple of times a day should do the trick. Just remember to watch your Pom like a hawk, as it's not unheard of for this breed to slip through holes in a fence or thick hedges or to scramble over short barriers.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of hawks (and owls), because Poms tend to resemble small rodents like squirrels, hedgehogs and rabbits, these winged predators may mistake your dog for their dinner and actually swoop down to carry a Pom away. Your best bet is to stay with your Pomeranian when out in fields or other large open areas at all times. A leashed pet is safest, rather than one who roams free, and always be aware of your surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe same layer of defense holds for bigger dogs you may encounter on your daily walks. Since some large pups may play rough with your Pom, it's wise to watch the path ahead and cross the street if you think a big breed may not mix well with your diminutive one.",
  "ideal_environment": "Nearly any type of family looking to add a small dog into their lives and homes would do well to consider the Pomeranian. This friendly breed is pleased to reside in small condos with adults or larger homes with a posse of pets and children. As a potential watchdog, a Pomeranian will alert their pet parents to arriving guests, deliveries and other action happening nearby.\n\nPoms can mesh well with active families and enjoy outings as long as pet parents allow this pup's short legs to keep the pace a reasonable one. Before heading out, Pom parents should always check the weather as high temperatures can overheat Pomeranians thanks to their fabulous double coat. Kids can easily entertain a Pom since games of \"fetch,\" and toys that squeak, bounce or crinkle are great for this breed. One to try: the Chuckit! balls, which come in a set of two in case one goes missing in the park.",
  "health_description": "The good news is that Pomeranians are generally healthy canines, though, like any breed, they have some health problems related to their tiny bodies that potential pet parents should learn about. Here's more on the specifics:\r\n\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: Patellar luxation, which is when the kneecap pops out of place, can be painful, causing your Pom to limp or develop arthritis. In severe cases, surgery may be needed to correct this issue.\r\n \tCollapsing Tracheas: Collapsing trachea occurs when the rings of the trachea are weak and can flatten in a way that interferes with breathing. Symptoms range from mild goose honking cough to severe respiratory distress. If your pup suffers from collapsing trachea, a harness will be better than a traditional neck collar so as not to put pressure on the trachea when walking. Treatment can range from lifestyle changes such as weight management to medication for cough to surgery depending on the severity.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is also very common in Poms and can include such signs as lethargy, hair thinning, a dry coat and an increase in weight without necessarily eating more kibble. A vet can run a blood test to diagnosis this issue and it can typically be regulated with medications.\r\n \tHypoglycemia: This condition of low blood sugar is seen in very small or very active Poms. You would notice your dog acting weak, sleepy, drunk, trembly and possibly having seizures. Keeping your puppy fed on a regular schedule helps prevent this issue, and most pups outgrow it as they mature.\r\n \tHip Issues: The two hip concerns that can develop in Pomeranians are Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and hip dysplasia, both of which occur when the ball and socket of this joint don't develop and grow properly. Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed.\r\n \tEye Problems: Pomeranians can occasionally exhibit eye problems, such as cataracts (cloudiness in the eye's lens) and entropion, a condition that causes the eyelids to roll inward. These may be genetic and can be diagnosed and treated by a veterinary ophthalmologist, possibly with surgery.\r\n \tHair loss: Alas, this breed's luxurious locks may be affected by Severe Hair Loss Syndrome or Pomeranian alopecia. Also known as Alopecia X or Black Skin Disease, it's mostly seen in male Poms. There is no genetic screening test, but it is hereditary so affected dogs should not be bred.",
  "history_description": "The Pomeranian origin has European roots and was named for a region called Pomerania in today's Poland and Germany. Poms are actually related to the breed of larger sled-pulling Spitz dogs, characterized by their pointy ears, thick coats and a big tail that curves along the back. While Poms can trace their lineage to sled dogs in Iceland, the breed has officially retired from this cold-weather position. Still, you can imagine how their fluffy fur and outer coats would fit in nicely near the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nThe British are big fans of Poms, thanks to the prominence the breed gained after Queen Victoria of England spied this pup while on a trip to Italy. She returned home with Poms in her bags and proceeded to breed and show the dogs for many years. In fact, it's Queen Victoria who was largely responsible for the tiny size we associate with Poms today. Once a midsize dog of 30 pounds, Pomeranians now sit side by side with Chihuahuas and Maltese as one of the smallest breeds.\r\n\r\nPomeranians came to the United States in 1892 and are among the oldest of recognized American Kennel Club breeds, gaining the AKC distinction in 1888. In 1911, the American Pomeranian Club hosted its first specialty show'just for Poms!\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Pomeranian puppies today? Check this list of reputable Pomeranian breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. As for the average Pomeranian price, depending on the breeder, you might spend between $500 to $1,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to a Pom rescue organization to adopt a POm, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are Pomeranians hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no, Pomeranians aren't hypoallergenic. While it might seem like a Pom's heavy coat would cause allergy symptoms, this breed isn't a heavy fur shedder when compared to others. Yet this dog type does shed dander or dead skin cells, which, along with saliva and urine, can trigger allergies in some people."

    {
      "question": "Are Pomeranians smart dogs?",
      "answer": "Yes, Pomeranians are smart dogs. They're known for their great intelligence and trainability as they're able to learn new skills and engage playfully with their pet parents. As watchdogs, Pomeranians step into the role of \"alarm dog\" quite nicely, making them smart additions to homes in both the city and country."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Pomeranians bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Yes, Pomeranians tend to bark a lot. These little dogs make themselves known with the bark, whether there's a knocking at the door or something surprising or startling has happened. If your apartment house or condo association has a quiet zone or clause, it might be wise to rethink a Pom."
