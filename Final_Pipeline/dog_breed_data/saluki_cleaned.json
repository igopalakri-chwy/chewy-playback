  "breed_intro": "With their sleek physique, the Saluki might look like they belong on the red carpet—but don't let their delicate features deceive you. These dogs are Olympians at heart; they can zoom at speeds up to 40 mph and jump a four-foot fence with finesse. But that doesn't mean you have to be an Olympic sprinter, too. They're happy for you just to watch with amazement from the sidelines. These graceful canines aren't all-race-no-snuggles, either. After a day of run-play-rinse-repeat, these gentle dogs are content to chill with you for a Netflix marathon. How perfect is that?",
  "appearance_description": "Salukis are large dogs, and historically they've been bred for speed and endurance. They're the epitome of athletic elegance and are deep-chested and well-muscled with a long and narrow build. Their short, straight coats are neatly offset by wisps of feather on the legs and tail. And their soulful eyes hint at this dog's high emotional intelligence.",
  "temperament_description": "The Saluki temperament is typically quiet and reserved. As such, this breed doesn't tend to be super talkative; it's rare to come across a Saluki who's a big barker. They play well with other dogs, but they may be shy until they get to know a familiar face. While they're watchful animals who may alert you when something's amiss at home, they're a bit too delicate to be an effective guard dog. Despite high levels of intelligence, Salukis are also not typically employed as service or therapy dogs.\r\n\r\nSalukis are usually gentle with children, but they may be sensitive to over-stimulation or excessive attention from very young or excitable kids. They aren't likely to bite, but they're also just not into being smothered with physical affection or in situations with handsy or rambunctious little ones. Lassie, the Saluki is not, so ensure any children in your dog's life have been taught how to respectfully interact with them.\r\n\r\nAnother defining characteristic can be their standoffishness with strangers, even though they often become quite fond of those in the household. In fact, they tend to bond with one family member in particular. (Beware, you jealous types!) They can suffer from separation anxiety if this person leaves home for extended periods, so the ideal pet parent will be able to commit to consistent face-time in this relationship.\r\n\r\nThe loyal and companionable Saluki can make a wonderful family dog. That said, they're not a fit for families with other small animals due to their strong prey drive and chase instincts, which are common in sighthounds. (If you've got a bunny or guinea pig who runs loose at home, a Saluki is not going to be a friendly roommate.) These traits also mean that Salukis need to be kept on a leash at all times unless they're in a safe, enclosed space. Got a flimsy fence? That's not gonna cut it with this breed. You'll want one that's at least six feet in height.",
  "care_description": "Salukis have a taste for luxury, as their royal ancestry might suggest. They can be fussy eaters, so they need a high-quality diet. Despite their good looks and Farrah Fawcett hair, they actually don't need a ton of grooming, but they do need a good bit of exercise and training, which takes some perseverance on your part. Their highest maintenance need may actually be their bedding. They prefer it on the softer, more luxurious side, thank you. Your own bed's high-thread-count sheets will do quite nicely.",
  "grooming_description": "Saluki grooming regimens are surprisingly simple. In fact, Salukis are quite low-maintenance compared to other dog breeds. It's rarely necessary to take them to a professional groomer.\n\nThat said, their coats will shine with weekly brushing—particularly around the feathered legs and tail—and a slicker brush is your best bet for removing mats. For Salukis' shorter body coat, a natural bristle brush will do. Excessive hair around the face can be trimmed with grooming scissors.\n\nSalukis find getting dirty distasteful—there's that air of royalty again—so a good bath once every three months is usually sufficient. For Salukis with skin sensitivities, be sure to consult your vet and buy some gentle dog shampoo that's formulated for your pet's needs.\n\nAs with other dog breeds, most vets recommend you brush your Saluki's teeth daily. This important practice helps stave off dental disease, periodontal problems and bad breath. Starting your Saluki on the practice at a young age is the best way to acclimate them. Your vet should also professionally clean your Saluki's teeth once a year.\n\nAlthough long, elegant, nails might seem a good look for the stately Saluki, their nails should still be trimmed as needed, i.e., whenever you start to hear that tell-tale click-clack as they walk down the hall. Keeping it neat and tidy is best. This is another routine that pet parents should start early so that your pup knows it's no biggie when the clippers come out of the drawer.\n\nSalukis are a low-shed breed, which means you can go ahead and buy that white living room sofa set. Just make sure it's nice and plush—providing comfortable surfaces for your Saluki is about more than just their persnicketiness. These slender dogs don't have much \"natural padding,\" so they really need soft bedding for their long lounge sessions. (It's so hard being beautiful.)",
  "training_description": "Salukis have a reputation for being tricky to train, and early exposure to other people and dogs is of utmost importance for this naturally shy breed. Fairly rigorous training requirements are the primary reason why Salukis aren't always a fit for first-time pup parents. And training may take some time, so it's helpful if you've been responsible for a dog before and understand the need to be patient and consistent—these \"independent thinkers\" require it. Keep your training sessions short and fun, avoid too much repetition so your pup doesn't get bored and use treats to your advantage. Salukis love a good nibble reward.\n\nTraining a Saluki puppy is all about socialization, socialization, socialization. Aim to introduce them to as many new people as possible in their first 12 to 14 weeks to help get them used to new encounters. And that means different—they should be exposed to a diverse pool of both humans and other dogs in calm situations to keep the experiences positive. Embrace that melting-pot mentality.\n\nIt's worth noting that all the training in the world may not quell this breed's chasing instincts. If they spot a squirrel or skateboarder while off-leash, all bets are off. And trust us: You're no match for that signature Saluki speed. So, it's crucial they're always kept on a leash when out and about. In the confines of a safe space, however, you can let 'er rip. With their history of racing, hunting and running, Salukis may also enjoy agility courses or lure coursing for mental stimulation.\n\nDue to their gentle nature, it's particularly important to use only positive and reward-based training methods with Salukis—treats, toys and praise for a job well done.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Salukis typically thrive on a diet of high-quality commercial dog food. Pet parents should be sure to choose a formula that fits their pup's stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Salukis can be finicky eaters though (must be all that pampering in their bones), so a bit of trial and error may be needed to find their ideal menu. The Saluki Club of America recommends a formula that lists some kind of meat as the first ingredient.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that because every dog has different dietary needs, there's no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Because some Salukis eat like birds and others like wolves, you'll have to watch your pet. For those on the teenage-boy-like ravenous end of things, you may have to keep an eye on their weight and separate them from any other dogs in the home at mealtime so they only eat their own portion. Your vet will be your best resource for helping you choose a specific food and feeding schedule that's best for your dog based on their lifestyle and needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Saluki exercise needs may seem contradictory. They can run up to speeds of 40 mph but they don't need to be on-the-go at all times. All told, you're going to have to give your Saluki daily exercise totalling one to two hours.\r\n\r\nSo what constitutes good exercise for this breed? Though these dogs do enjoy running, they're not equipped for an entire day's worth of activity and exertion, so this is not the breed to take with you on rigorous hikes. But 20-minute leash walks on city streets aren't quite enough activity, either. Salukis really need to be able to run freely in an enclosed environment like a fenced yard or dog park at least a few times a week. When sufficiently exercised in this way, Salukis tend to be pretty placid.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind they can become bored and antsy or destructive if they don't get to stretch their sprinter's legs at least once a day. Make sure to have some safe dog toys and chews on hand to keep them busy.",
  "ideal_environment": "Salukis are intelligent, intuitive and extremely perceptive, making them highly attuned to others' emotions. They're most at ease in a laid-back setting with calm or older kids. No roughhousing for these sensitive souls.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to hosting visitors, Salukis won't be hostile or aggressive, but they probably won't be the life of the party, either. They tend to enjoy peace and quiet, as well as a stable routine. World travelers and adventurers they are not.\r\n\r\nSalukis aren't overly sensitive to heat or cold, but if you live somewhere with a brisk winter season, they'll appreciate a doggy sweater or light layer when the temperatures dip into the 40s or lower. In hot temperatures, they should always have access to shade and plenty of water.\r\n\r\nRetirees living in a home with a fenced-in yard may make the perfect pet parents for Salukis. Since these pups are independent thinkers and can be tricky to train, they're also best suited for people who understand the consistency and patience these dogs need in training, which is why they are not the best fit for a first-time pup parent.",
  "health_description": "Saluki life expectancy is usually between 10 and 17 years, and they’re considered an overall robust breed. That said, there are a few health issues that affect the Saluki breed more frequently than some other dog breeds.\r\n\n \t• Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): In this cardiac disease, the heart becomes enlarged, resulting in a weakened ability to pump. This can lead to congestive heart failure. Treatment is typically daily medications.\nGastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Like other dog breeds with deep chests, Salukis may experience GDV (aka bloat), which causes the dog’s stomach to fill with gas and become twisted. It can occur suddenly and is a life-threatening emergency. To help reduce the chance of your dog experiencing GDV, use a slow feeding bowl at mealtime, keep the bowl on the ground (don’t elevate it) and avoid exercising at least an hour before or after mealtime. If you think your pup is suffering from GDV, get to your vet immediately.\nHip Dysplasia: This genetic orthopedic condition occurs due to malformation of the hip ball and socket joint, resulting in laxity and rubbing. Symptoms can include limping, pain and arthritis that are typically treated with joint supplements, pain medication or surgery depending on the severity.\nNeuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis: This storage disease can result in blindness, disorientation and seizures. There is no cure, but genetic screening testing is available.\nCancer: Saluki dogs are prone to several types of cancer including lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and mammary cancer. Treatment will depend on the specific condition and can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and palliative care.",
  "history_description": "If the Saluki's majestic mug somehow just screams \"descendant of royalty\" to you, you're onto something—the Saluki dog breed was once a favorite among rulers, like Alexander the Great. For centuries, these noble animals graced the palaces of royal families of the Middle East and sat throne-side among pharaohs.\r\n\r\nArcheologists have found ancient artifacts, including sculptures and paintings, that depict slender dogs with feathered, Saluki-like features. Possible Saluki mummies have also been found in tombs. These discoveries give experts reason to think that the Saluki may be one of the oldest domestic dog breeds in the world.\r\n\r\nAlso known as Persian Greyhounds or Gazelle Hounds, these dogs were originally bred in the Middle East as sighthounds for hunting. (Sighthounds are dogs who hunt by sight instead of by following their nose, as a Beagle would.) In more recent years, the Saluki has become famous for their running and racing abilities.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Saluki as an official breed in 1927. Saluki puppy prices range from $400 to $1,000, and the cost goes up from there. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC website. If you'd like to adopt, reach out to Saluki rescue organizations or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
