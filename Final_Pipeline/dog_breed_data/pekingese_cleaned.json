  "breed_intro": "The Pekingese is literally doggy royalty—and don't they know it! Bred to be companions to emperors, these little pups certainly understand the finer things in life. That includes quiet mornings for reflection. And if you wake them up early for a morning jog, they'll roll their eyes and go back to bed. (Who gets up before the sun, anyway?) These feisty little pups know what they want, and they have no problem telling you, their favorite head of staff. But don't be fooled, being a pet parent to a Pekingese is plenty of fun—just be prepared to set out a few velvet cushions for your little monarch to lounge on.",
  "appearance_description": "The Pekingese lives up to their nickname \"lion dog,\" thanks to the impressive mane of dense hair around their neck. Aside from their mane, they also have naturally long hair that, unless trimmed short, entirely covers their compact and low-slung body, which is surprisingly heavy for their height. There's nothing dainty or delicate about a Pekingese. Another of their defining characteristics is their broad, flat head and soulful eyes that hints this ancient breed know just how to live life the way they have for centuries: in the lap of luxury.",
  "temperament_description": "Pekingese bond very strongly with their families, but they're less impressed with strangers. As a natural and observant watchdog, one of their qualities includes keeping a close eye on their surroundings. They will bark to let you know if anyone is approaching their kingdom, which they'll often take to include the whole neighborhood!\n\nThey're certainly not an aggressive breed, but they're not afraid to let people and other dogs know if they've overstepped the mark. They can live in a house with kids and babies but won't necessarily want to play with them. It's not that they don't like kids; they just don't know what to do with them. Pekingese are not as playful as some other dog breeds, like the Labrador Retriever, and they'd rather chill with you on the couch. If you do have kids around, make sure they know how to interact with a dog in a gentle and appropriate manner. A Pekingese may nip if their patience is tested too often. They can also live with other pets, although they may not be tolerant of a playful kitten or bouncy puppy as they get older. Because of this, it's important to start socializing your puppy early, so they get used to being around kids and other animals.\n\nPekingese are incredibly charming, and they know how to use that to their advantage. They also have a huge amount of boldness and self-esteem—traits that stem from centuries of being revered by royalty. This, combined with their small size, means it can be tempting to slack off on training, but Pekingese need an experienced pet parent who understands the need for consistency so they don't fall into bad habits, like deciding potty training isn't important. Just because they can be more challenging to train than other breeds doesn't mean these dogs aren't intelligent. On the contrary, they're smart enough to train their humans—so watch out!\n\nThis breed adores spending time with their pet parents but will also happily spend a few hours on their own indoors. They can sometimes bond with one member of the family more than everyone else, and while they will be affectionate with all their family, their true devotion will be reserved for their chosen person.",
  "care_description": "Pekingese expect to be waited on like the royal dogs they are. They might be small, but they need a decent amount of both grooming and training. They don't need much exercise, but they do expect (and demand) plenty of affection from their devoted pet parents. These little dogs are brachycephalic (which gives them their cute, smooshy faces) and need be in a cooler environment as they can easily overheat in hot weather.",
  "grooming_description": "These little pups are pretty high maintenance when it comes to grooming. Here are some tips to keep in mind for your Pekingese:\n\n \t• Brushing: You should dedicate at least one hour a week to brushing your dog's coat to keep it free from tangles and remove dead hair. You might decide to split this into smaller daily sessions. A slicker brush plus a deshedding tool will be your friend when it comes to grooming your Peke.\nHaircuts: If you're not interested in dog shows, many pet parents opt to have their dog's coat trimmed (not short) to keep it more manageable. Bear in mind that giving a Peke a short haircut isn't recommended, as their double coat acts as insulation in both hot and cold weather. But a regular sesh with a professional groomer—a brush, bath and trim—about every four to six weeks can help keep your Peke's coat looking neat.\nBathing: For most of the year, a bath once every month or two will help keep your dog's coat looking its best. During heavier shedding seasons (fall and spring), you may choose to bathe your Pekingese once a week or bi-weekly; it helps get rid of the dead hair.\nNail trimming: As well as looking after your Peke's coat, you'll need to check their nails once a week. Trim or clean these as necessary. You'll know it's time to trim their nails when you hear them tapping on hard surfaces. (Get the how-to-here.)\nEar cleaning: Check your Pekingese's ears once a week for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nDental care: Pekingese dogs need their teeth brushed daily; this helps prevent them from getting gum disease or plaque. Starting this routine while your dog is still a puppy is a great idea, as it's much easier for them to accept it as part of their routine. Your dog will still need an annual dental cleaning by your vet. Pekingese often have an underbite, which you should ask your vet to monitor in case it causes any issues.",
  "training_description": "The sooner you can start training your Pekingese puppy, the better. This breed needs consistent training and guidance. Being born for palace life gets one used to, um, having one's own way and they may try to boss you around! Starting training while they're a puppy helps them understand you're the boss (applesauce) and will trust you as their leader.\n\nAs you train your pup, be sure to use positive reinforcement, a type of reward-based training that uses treats, praise and playtime with special toys, when your pup does a good job.\n\nPekes also need plenty of socialization so they learn how to interact with strangers and other dogs. A great place to start is with puppy preschool. Here, puppies learn to play nicely with each other, and they get to meet new people.\n\nOne potential area of difficulty is potty training. Sometimes small dogs are just harder to potty train. Diminutive pups have small bladders and need to go out more frequently, and their cues aren't as obvious as, say, a Labrador's. As with all training, consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them when they potty outside. (You'll want to use the same cue words, like \"let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.)\n\nCrate training is a great way to help potty train your puppy. Dogs like to keep their \"dens\" clean, and a crate that's just the right size mimics that den-like feel. Find a crate that falls within the \"Goldilocks\" zone: not too small and not too large. You want a crate with enough room they can turn around in, not one so large your puppy chooses to use one end as a bathroom.\n\nWorking with a certified dog trainer can help you find the techniques you need to get the best results with this independent and strong-willed breed. These little pups might be more of a challenge to train than other breeds, but that doesn't mean they're not smart. Training a Pekingese is not the same as working with an enthusiastic and eager-to-please Golden Retriever, so while Pekingese may be suited for an experienced person, they'll do well with a first-time pup parent who's confident in their training abilities and understands the need for consistency.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Pekingese dogs usually do well on a high-quality, complete and balanced commercial dog food. Make sure you choose a formula for your dog's specific life stage (puppy, adult, senior), and look for a statement on the bag that says it meets the nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).\n\nThe small size of this breed means it can be very easy for them to put on weight. Avoid feeding fatty table scraps and make sure all those dog treats you dole out during training are accounted for when you're working out how much to feed your pup every day. If your pup is packing on the pounds, your vet may recommend you feed a weight-control dog food with reduced calories but still containing all the nutrition your dog needs.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, it's always best to ask your vet for advice. They can help you choose the best food for your dog based on their unique requirements.",
  "exercise_description": "With their lower energy level and exercise needs, Pekingese lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle. They're much happier sitting—preferably on their velvet cushion—and watching the world go by (with the odd bark when necessary) than running around with the other dogs. But they still need exercise and will benefit from a short walk around 20 to 30 minutes every day.\r\n\r\nSome Pekes may enjoy joining in dog sports like agility but don't expect them to win any prizes for speed, in part due to their characteristic \"rolling\" gait. This breed takes life at their own pace and won't be rushed. On hot or humid days, it's best to keep your dog inside an air-conditioned home or take your walks in the cooler parts of the day; they don't cope well with hot weather due to their short muzzles. If you're looking for an active breed to accompany you on hikes, runs or long walks, the Pekingese is likely not the dog for you. (Check out the Husky or Dalmatian.)",
  "ideal_environment": "The Pekingese is a great choice for apartment or urban living, thanks to their small size and low exercise needs. They're incredibly devoted to their pet parents but aren't fond of strangers or an excessively busy home. They can be vocal watchdogs, too, so expect running commentary from your little friend.\n\nPekingese can be a little challenging to train, so they're more suited for experienced pet parents with the skills to get the best from a breed who likes to get their own way whenever possible. Pekingese prefer a quiet life without children or other pets where they can be their rightful place as the center of attention. They can adapt to living in homes with more activity, but socialization—early and often—is important.\n\nThis breed is a brachycephalic dog; their short muzzles mean they can struggle in hot weather. AC is a must if you live somewhere warmer, and some Peke families travel with cooling blankets or ice packs to help their pups stay comfortable. They're also poor swimmers and should always be supervised near water.",
  "health_description": "Pekingese have a life expectancy of 12-14 years; although, like any breed, they can suffer from a few different types of health issues. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with these, so you know you can provide what your Peke needs to stay healthy for as long as possible. \r\n\n \t• Brachycephalic Airway Obstruction Syndrome (BAOS): One of the most common health problems for this breed is BAOS. BAOS affects breeds with short muzzles and can lead to breathing problems, particularly in hot weather. In severe cases, surgery may be needed.  \r\n \t• Eye Problems: Pekingese eyes are prominent, and their shortened muzzle can’t protect them from bumps and corneal ulcers. Pekingese can suffer from distichiasis, where extra eyelashes grow inside the eyelid and can be either plucked or treated with lubricants. Cataracts and glaucoma both cause blindness. Cataracts may be treated with surgery, and glaucoma may be treated with analgesics if caught early enough. Dry eye, another eye problem seen in Pekes, may be treated with medicated eye drops. \r\n \t• Back Problems: The combination of their short legs and long back can result in issues like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Symptoms can range from pain to trouble walking to inability to stand or walk. Possible treatment can include rest, medication or surgery based on severity. If your dog is showing signs of IVDD, please see a veterinarian immediately. \r\n \t• Heart Issues: Pekingese can suffer from mitral valve disease, which may cause a heart murmur. If your vet detects a heart murmur, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause. \r\n \t• Patellar Luxation: This occurs when the kneecap, or patella, slips from the correct position. It’s a common issue in small dogs and can be inherited. The main symptom is lameness, although sometimes this resolves very quickly when the patella returns to the correct position. Treatments vary depending on the severity and range from weight management to surgery.",
  "history_description": "The Pekingese breed is of Chinese origin, with legends telling us that Buddha took a lion and shrunk them into the size of a dog to create the Pekingese breed, aka the \"lion dog.\" While this might not be the true facts of how the breed came to be, we do know the Imperial Family in 8th-century China was fascinated with the breeding of small dogs. The Pekingese share their heritage with the Shih Tzu and Pug in that respect. These breeds were protected by the Chinese emperors of the Peking Palace for centuries, with the Western world being unaware of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe Pekingese dog was bred to be companion dogs to Chinese nobles—only they were allowed to have them. But the dogs became ornamental as some nobles would carry their dogs in the wide sleeves of their robes, which led to the Pekingese's other nickname, \"sleeve dogs.\" These sleeve dogs also became the personal guard dogs for the nobles who carried them.\r\n\r\nThe Pekingese only came to the West after Peking (now called Beijing) was ransacked by the British in 1860. History tells us the Chinese nobility killed their dogs rather than allow them to fall into the hands of their enemies. Despite their attempts, five dogs were discovered in hiding and were removed by British troops before the Palace was burnt.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were brought to Britain and gifted to Queen Victoria, and the Pekingese dog became the favorite of another royal family. The first Pekingese came to the US in the late 1890s, and the breed was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1906. Today, these small dogs rank 96 on the AKC's popularity list.\r\n\r\nReady to look for a Pekingese puppy? The best place to start your search is with the reputable breeders on the AKC website. Pekingese puppies cost $700-$3,000. Reputable breeders should screen for health and temperament issues and may offer pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a Pekingese dog, look for a Pekingese rescue or keep an eye out for the breed at a local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do Pekingese shed?",
      "answer": "Yes, Pekingese shed. And thanks to their long and dense double coat, their shedding can be significant. Pekingese will shed throughout the year but will often shed more heavily in the spring and fall."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you pronounce Pekingese?",
      "answer": "Pekingese is a word of Chinese origin and is pronounced \"pee-kuh-NEEZ,\" with emphasis on the last syllable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Pekingese smart dogs?",
      "answer": "Yes, Pekingese are smart dogs. They are famous for their intelligence. They're also known for their independent and spirited natures. So while they may understand exactly what you're asking them to do, they may simply choose not to do it. The best way to harness the intelligence of your little Peke is to work with a trainer who uses positive reinforcement. (See more of that above in the Training section.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Pekingese bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Pekingese only bark when necessary. They are always on the lookout and will sound the alarm whenever they see something out of the ordinary. They're not overly yappy, so they only bark when there's something to bark about. Depending on where you live, this may be a little barking or a lot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Pekingese dogs swim?",
      "answer": "Technically, Pekingese can swim. However, this breed isn't a strong swimmer due to their combination of flat face, short legs and dense coat. Some Pekingese may enjoy a paddle in shallow water on a hot day, but they should never be left unattended around water and should always wear a doggy life jacket. If you have swimming pools, ponds or any other types of water on your property, be sure to restrict access, so your dog can't accidentally fall in."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the most common Pekingese mixes?",
      "answer": "The most common Pekingese mixes are:\r\n\n \t• Pekingese-Chihuahua mix (Pekachi)\nPekingese-Shih Tzu mix (Shihnese)\nPekingese-Pug mix (Puginese)\nPekingese-Pomeranian mix (Peek-A-Pom)\nPekingese-Yorkshire Terrier mix (Yorkingese)\r\n\nNote: These are not purebred dogs but mixed breeds."
