  "breed_intro": "The Brittany's enthusiasm and energy is almost always at 100 percent. If you're the proud parent of a Brittany, we're guessing you plan your vacation itineraries in 15-minute time slots—so many activities with so little time! The Brittany is raring to go no matter what you throw at them: errands, a run around the neighborhood, your afternoon Instagram shoot at the local park, and, of course, dinner with friends—it's your week to host! Energetic, fun and upbeat, a Brittany's the perfect match for your active life.",
  "appearance_description": "Brittanies are medium dogs with an athletic form and energetic gait—their relatively long legs were made for running fast. And their bright smiles and intelligent eyes belie their readiness for a game of fetch. With their delightfully patterned coats and short, docked tail (or in some cases, no tail at all), these pups are a fan-favorite in the show ring.",
  "temperament_description": "The Brittany dog is a friendly, affectionate pet who loves spending time with their people. A true companion dog, they want to be with you all the time and would really prefer to be in your company than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nBred to be a versatile hunting dog, they are intelligent, adaptable and ready for action at a moment's notice, whether competing in a tracking event or taking a walk in the park. And these high-energy pups enjoy a lot of activity, so plan on them running with you every morning. Just be prepared for shouts of “Pretty dog!\" and “Go, puppy, go!\" Your friendly pup will manage a cheerful smile and a butt wiggle without missing a step.\r\n\r\nThough playful and energetic, Brittanies are not fans of homes with a lot of chaos. These pups are truly sensitive souls who want harmony in the home, and raised voices—even if you're shouting at a referee on TV—may cause the dog stress.\r\n\r\nBrittany dogs aren't known for aggression or biting. Born to be a bird dog, they have a \"soft mouth,\" like a Labrador Retriever, which means they can control the strength of their bite. They'll even gently carry their favorite toy around the house. Their happy-go-lucky personality means they're happy to share that toy with their two and four-legged family members. Hope you're ready for a few games of fetch with a slobbery tennis ball!",
  "care_description": "Overall, Brittany dogs' care needs are moderate. Their grooming routine is minimal, and bathing is made easier because of their short coat. As a bonus, these pups are easy to train. And let's face it, either activity will fill the attention meter and make your pup content. Their biggest need will be enough exercise, so make sure you have the time to give it to them.",
  "grooming_description": "It's easy to imagine the peppy Brittany twirling in place and panting, “Let's get our groom on, Mom!\" When it comes to grooming, the breed is the equivalent of your favorite cotton dress with pockets—low maintenance, functional and pretty to look at. (#score) Here are some grooming tips for your Brittany:\n\n \t• Brushing: Short, dense hair equals less brushing and little shedding. These pups need a weekly brushing with a soft brush, like the Bass Brushes Shine & Condition Brush, or a brushing mitt, like this grooming glove from Frisco, to remove dirt and any loose hairs from their coat. Follow up with a comb on the longer feathers, normally on the ears, legs and tummy, and the hard part's over.\nEar cleaning: Don't forget to check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \nBathing: Bathing once a month will keep your Brittany smelling fresh. Need to freshen up in between? A quick swipe with a grooming wipe, and they're ready for hugs.\nNail trimming: After their bath, give their nails a trim. You'll know it's time when you hear the tell-tale \"click-clack\" on the kitchen floor. Post bathtime is the perfect time for nail trimming, as the bath softens the nails and makes the whole process easier for everyone.\nDental care: The last grooming chore is taking care of that smile. Veterinarians recommend brushing daily to prevent tooth loss and disease. Get step-by-step toothbrushing instructions. And don't forget to schedule your Brittany for an annual professional cleaning by your vet.",
  "training_description": "Training is a must for the Brittany , especially for Brittany puppies. Their intelligent mind leads them to independent thinking, and, as hunting dogs, they have a strong prey drive. Starting training while they're a puppy helps them more readily adapt to your way of thinking.\n\nTeach them the fundamentals like sit, stay, come and how to walk nicely on a leash. These skills are important to help keep them safe and well-mannered as they grow up. But it's important to understand that these pups have strong hunting instincts that you're never going to completely train out of them, like their desire to chase.\n\nLike all dogs (and you!), Brittanies respond well to reward-based training, aka positive reinforcement. Reward them when they do a good job with treats, lots of praise and play breaks with fun toys, and redirect them when they don't do what you want them to do. And be sure to take a break or a walk before either of you gets frustrated. Keep training fun for both of you!\n\nSocialization is another necessity for this social butterfly. They need to know what behaviors are appropriate when meeting someone, furry or not, outside their family. Take your puppy on walks and let them meet new people and dogs you pass by. Consider enrolling them in puppy school, too, where they can learn to play nicely with other puppies and mix and mingle with other people all in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Brittany dogs typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for the statement on the packaging that says the food meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nBecause your Brittany is so high energy, your vet may recommend slightly larger portions, more frequent feedings, or a high-protein food. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality treats will also be a hit with your puppy, and small training treats are great for teaching tricks and practicing obedience. Remember that treats equal calories, though, so make sure they don't overindulge. If you notice your pup gaining a little extra weight, chat with your vet. They can help you put together an exercise and diet plan to help your pup lose the weight and maintain the nutrition they need.",
  "exercise_description": "Run, walk, play, rinse, repeat. Your bundle of fun will need lots of exercise. Lots. Brittany dogs are athletes through and through, and plenty of exercise—think 60-90 minutes throughout the day—keeps them happy, healthy and out of trouble. If you don't fulfill your dog's energy levels every day, they're creative and will come up with their own ways to entertain themselves, and your favorite heels or your flower garden may not appreciate their efforts.\n\nOne benefit of lots of exercise is that they get to spend plenty of time with you, which will always be their favorite thing to do. Lace-up your sneakers and snap on your pup's leash for your morning run. Take them on weekend outings as you explore the Great Outdoors full of hikes, camping trips and other adventures.\n\nIf you enjoy a bit of friendly competition, get involved in dog sports. Because these pups were bred to be versatile, they excel at a variety of sports, including agility, tracking, flyball and obedience, to name a few. And these sports pull double-duty as training activities. #doublewin\n\nIf you want to take advantage of your dog's gorgeous look, Brittanies do well in the show ring, too. Brittany dogs are one of those rare breeds who often win titles in both the field and in conformation (dog shows). Either way, you're guaranteed to have a lot of fun, and you may come home with a few championship ribbons to show off.\n\nThese pups have a strong prey drive. After all, they were born to be pointing dogs, where they chase and point at their quarry, so hunters can find them. Always have your pup on a leash when you're not in an enclosed area, like a fenced yard. These pups will chase everything they think needs chasing, and no amount of training—or yelling as they speed away—will stop them until they've finished the chase. And they won't look both ways before crossing the street. So, for your sanity and their safety, always keep them on a leash.",
  "ideal_environment": "Brittany dogs need a home where they'll get a lot of love and a ton of exercise. They really need a home with a fenced backyard where they can safely run around and stretch their legs during a rousing game of fetch, and therefore, aren't ideal for smaller places like apartments.\n\nThe breed is an exceptional family dog who loves kids, although you'll want to supervise them around smaller kids and babies, as your pup may accidentally knock a tot over in their enthusiasm. Brittanies get along great with other dogs in the home, and they can get along with cats if raised together from puppyhood. But they do have strong hunting instincts, so small animals will be chased.\n\nBrittanies need lots of attention and time with their humans. If you're lucky enough to work from home, you might possibly be their favorite person ever. If you have to be gone for long, schedule time at doggy daycare or arrange for a neighbor or pet sitter to come by and play with your pup. If you travel a lot, this may not be the dog for you—they will miss you way too much!",
  "health_description": "The Brittany breed suffers very few major health issues or genetic defects. With an expected lifespan of 12-14 years, your fluffy friend should be with you for a long time. While they have relatively few health issues, here are a couple you should watch for. \r\n\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs. It is caused by decreased thyroid gland function, secondary to thyroid inflammation or thyroid atrophy. The thyroid gland is responsible for regulating metabolism. Decreased thyroid activity can therefore lead to weight gain (without increased appetite), lethargy, skin and coat changes, reproductive difficulties, and some neurological conditions. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through blood testing, so thyroid levels should be a part of routine screening bloodwork as Brittany’s age. This condition can be managed with medications. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition that occurs as a dog grows, causing the hip joints to develop improperly. The result is instability or looseness of the hip joint and eventually leads to cartilage wear and degenerative arthritis. Degenerative arthritis can further lead to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, as well as pain. This condition is typically diagnosed with X-rays. Symptoms include decreased activity, diminished range of motion in the rear limbs and “bunny hopping.” Treatments may include medications, joint supplements, weight management and physical therapy. Severe cases may be treated surgically. \r\n \t• Eye Disease: Eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma are other potential health issues. Cataracts cause the lenses of the eyes to become opaque and can lead to blindness. Glaucoma is caused by an increase in intraocular pressure and can lead to slowly developing or sudden blindness and pain. Monitor your pet for any changes in pupil size, eye color, cloudiness, squinting, rubbing, or any difficulty seeing. More advanced glaucoma may appear as a swollen or bulging eye. Schedule an appointment promptly with your vet if you have any concerns. Eye disease is often treatable with medication and sometimes surgery. \r\n \t• Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects the brain and results in recurrent seizures. Epilepsy is diagnosed when all other causes of seizures have been investigated and ruled out. Epilepsy ranges in severity, with some dogs experiencing seizures very rarely and others as often as daily. Depending on the severity, medications are available to control the seizure activity.",
  "history_description": "The Brittany breed's origins come from the Brittany region of France, likely in the 17th century. We all like to show off our fur babies, and the people of that time were no different. Hunting dogs who resemble the Brittany breed show up in paintings and tapestries from around that time, like their close relatives, the English Setters.\r\n\r\nIn the 1600s, only nobles and wealthy landowners had enough money to keep entire kennels of dogs specialized for different types of hunting. Commoners, and sometimes poachers, needed all-purpose dogs who could point, flush and retrieve. The Brittany, like the German Shorthaired Pointer, is a versatile hunting pup. The Brittany was also bred to be an adept bird dog.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed, then known as the Brittany Spaniel, in 1934. The breed first became popular in the United States in the 1940s, and today is No. 28 on the AKC's most popular dog breed list. Their versatility is part of what makes them so popular. Unlike many breeds, Brittanies are considered to be a dual breed, meaning they excel at both conformation competitions and field trials. In fact, the Brittany breed has the most dual champions of any AKC Sporting breed. (Sporting dogs were bred to work with hunters.) To be a dual champion, the dog must be a finished show champion and a field champion of record.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to buy a Brittany puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. Prices for a Brittany puppy range $700-$1,000. But for that price, you likely get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. Would you rather adopt a Brittany in need of a home? Check out the American Brittany Rescue, or keep an eye out for the pup at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
