  "breed_intro": "The Chinese Crested dog is well known for their unique coats—they're practically hairless so they barely shed! (Well, not all of them.) But they're so much more than their trademark hairstyle. These lively pups have one purpose: to warm your heart and your lap. Cresteds want to be with you wherever you are, and if you leave them alone for long, they may try to escape in order to find you. But it's only because they care about you—they really want to make sure you're happy. So, say goodbye to solo nights with pizza and Netflix.",
  "appearance_description": "Whether your Chinese Crested is the powderpuff or hairless variety, these toy dogs will mesmerize you with their lively gait and elegant physique. Hairless Chinese Cresteds have soft and silky skin, while powderpuffs shimmer with a soft coat of silky hair straight out of a shampoo commercial. Their eyes shine with an alert, attentive gaze that reflects their loyalty and love—a trait further confirmed with an eager trot in your direction whenever you walk through the door.",
  "temperament_description": "Chinese Cresteds are sweet, playful and incredibly affectionate. But don't mistake their buoyancy for a \"devil-may-care\" attitude. These dogs tend to be quite sensitive and respond best to tenderness and patience—they won't quickly forget harsh words. Cresteds crave TLC in return for their unwavering attention and affection.\n\nDoes this mean Chinese Crested dogs are a little needy? Well, yes. They are known to be Velcro dogs. But if you don't mind a sensitive little stalker who's always up for snuggling, this might be the pup for you.\n\nLike other toy breeds, Chinese Cresteds can be \"mouthy\" at times. Though they love their families, they can be nervous and nippy with strangers. In addition to getting your pup used to new people and situations (commonly referred to as \"socialization\"), savvy pet parents may be able temper their pup's urge to nip and nibble by offering chew toys or playing tug-of-war.\n\nRaising a Chinese Crested with kids or other small dogs or cats can be a great success if the household isn't too chaotic. Little ones who enjoy rough play could endanger this tiny dog. Cresteds thrive with kids who know how to be calm and gentle with their diminutive pup. Children might need to be reminded not to try to wrestle or play roughly with this pup. Thus, it's not only important that dogs are socialized early on, but also that kids are taught how to properly interact with dogs.\n\nThis ultra-affectionate, lively breed could be trained to excel as a companion dog, emotional therapy dog and a snuggly lapdog for tenderhearted kids and adults.",
  "care_description": "Raising a Chinese Crested will be easy-peasy—these are low-maintenance pups! But that doesn't mean your dog doesn't need TLC. Like any kid or fur baby, these pups need affection, play and a bit of grooming (yes, even the hairless ones).",
  "grooming_description": "A Chinese Crested's grooming needs are fairly low compared to other dog breeds, and their hair care depends on whether you have a hairless or powderpuff dog.\n\n \t• Brushing and bathing: Your powderpuff pup should be brushed daily or every other day with a pin brush followed by a comb to make sure you get the tangles out. Unlike other double-coated dogs (dogs with an undercoat and a topcoat), the powderpuff's undercoat is actually longer than the topcoat and is more prone to tangles. You may also need to give their muzzle a haircut about twice a month, and they only need a bath about once a month (more often if dirty, of course). You might think that hairless dogs don't need grooming, but you'd be wrong! Brush their bits of fur with a pin brush or a comb once a week to avoid tangles.\nSkin care: More importantly, when it comes to the hairless Cresteds, you'll need to care for your dog's bare skin. Keep your dog in the shade and apply sunscreen as needed, especially if your pup is lighter skinned. If your dog gets a sunburn, apply aloe vera or a dog-friendly after-sun lotion as soon as possible. These pups may also have to deal with acne. Treat it gently: Avoid popping pimples, apply acne ointments when necessary and be sure to keep their skin clean. Hairless pups can be bathed weekly to keep their skin healthy. And don't forget the skin benefits of clean bedding and fresh air!\nEar cleaning: While you're brushing your pup (either type), check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nDental care: Chinese Crested dogs are prone to dental problems, so brush their teeth daily. Offer dental dog treats to support their oral hygiene. And don't forget to take your pup for annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not a groomer).\nNail trimming: You'll need to trim their nails about once a month. You'll know it's time for a trim when you can hear their nails clicking on the floor.",
  "training_description": "Chinese Crested puppies look elegant and graceful, but they still need to be trained. Start obedience training (basic commands like sit, stay and come) and socialization as soon as you bring your dog home. By introducing your Chinese Crested to new people and places, you can help them feel more comfortable and confident as they grow up (and curb their nippiness around strangers).\n\nTo socialize your pup, take them on walks so they can see (and sniff!) new people and other dogs. Puppy school is another great way to practice socialization. Here, puppies learn how to play nicely with each other, and they get to meet strangers and discover that people outside their family can be nice, too.\n\nHousebreaking a Chinese Crested can be tricky depending on your dog's personality traits—they can be quite sensitive and may shut down emotionally if you're too harsh with them. These intelligent dogs respond well to patient and calm family members. And remember that positive reinforcement can go a long way. (Positive reinforcement rewards pups for a good job with treats, praise and playtime with special toys.) So if your Crested has accidents as you start potty training, don't give in to your anxiety or frustration. Calmly and gently direct your puppy to where you want them to go potty. And remember to reward them when they do a great job. Practice makes perfect!\n\nSet yourself up for success by buying appropriate dog toys before you bring a Chinese Crested home. Chew toys give them a positive outlet for their puppy chewing. Balls for playing fetch or ropes for tug of war help your pup understand which items are for biting and which are not. Remember the three Ps: patience, playfulness and positive reinforcement.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Chinese Crested dogs typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Your veterinarian can help you determine the exact amount and type of food for your Chinese Crested pup. As you browse dog food varieties, be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nSome hairless Chinese Cresteds have missing teeth. Don't worry—this is a perfectly normal trait in hairless dogs. (Xoloitzcuintli dogs have this, too.) In that case, most vets recommend soft food or experimenting with a combination of soft food and solid kibble. (But check with your vet first.)\r\n\r\nBecause Chinese Cresteds are tiny creatures, even an extra pound can create health problems for you pup, including heart disease. So, be sure to include the treats you give (for training or because you love them) in their overall daily meal count. Instead of leaving food out all day for them to graze, have specific mealtimes when the food is available. If you see your pup gaining a little extra weight, talk with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a mealtime and exercise plan to help your pup lose the weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Chinese Crested puppies enjoy energetic play and brisk walks just like many other young dogs. Moderately active, alert and lively, they're not hyperactive or in need of several walks each day. Your Chinese Crested will probably be satisfied with a brisk morning walk plus some evening chasing or tug-of-war in the backyard or house, totaling about 30 minutes. Just don't forget the sunscreen for your hairless variety if you're heading outside to play!\n\nOf course, Chinese Cresteds are known for their agility. They excel in competitive sports like flyball and obstacle course racing. These dogs were bred to hunt rats, after all, which takes some energy.\n\nDon't forget to exercise their brains, too! Leave a few toy puzzles around the house for them to solve and get a delicious treat for their efforts.",
  "ideal_environment": "Any person or family with gentle, patient older kids would do well to consider welcoming a Chinese Crested into their home. This pup doesn't need much space, but they do need attention. Separation anxiety can lead to bouts of barking or even escape attempts. As long as there's someone home, this loving breed is just as happy in a tiny apartment as a large house with fellow pets and kids. (If you do have to be gone, check your pup into doggie daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or neighbor to swing by for a while.)\n\nA word on climate: Your Chinese Crested is easily burned in the sun and chilled in the cold. If you live somewhere with all four seasons, expect your pup to sport sunscreen and fashionable sweaters in equal measure.",
  "health_description": "Chinese Cresteds have a lifespan of 13-18 years and have some health problems you should be aware of. It’s important for potential pet parents to know what these health issues are, so you can help your pup live the healthiest life possible. \r\n\n \t• Patellar Luxation: This common health problem happens when your dog’s knee cap pops out of place, resulting in a limp. Depending on the severity, treatments range from weight management to physical therapy to surgery. \r\n \t• Eye Problems: Sometimes, Chinese Crested dogs inherit eye problems like progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), gradually failing eyesight with no cure. These dogs can also develop glaucoma (eye pressure that leads to optic nerve damage) and primary lens luxation (dislocation of the lens in the eye). Medication or surgery may be an option with glaucoma (if caught early enough) and lens luxation. \r\n \t• Skin Problems: Hairless Chinese Cresteds are prized (and yes, sometimes teased) for their delicate, bare skin. But their bare skin is prone to sunburn, acne and even skin cancer. Slather your dog’s pink skin areas with dog-friendly sunscreen to help prevent serious problems. If your pup gets a serious sunburn, rash or noticeable irritation, schedule a visit with the veterinarian.  \r\n \t• Dental Disease: Researchers have found that hairless dogs are also genetically prone to teeth issues. That’s certainly true of Chinese Cresteds. Daily teeth brushing and annual dental cleaning with your veterinarian can help prevent serious issues.  \r\n \t• Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Some Chinese Cresteds are prone to orthopedic conditions like Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a disorder characterized by femoral joint degeneration that can lead to limping and pain. This condition can be diagnosed with an X-ray evaluation and is typically treated with surgery and pain medication. \r\n \t• Deafness: Chinese Crested pups can be born with congenital deafness. However, dogs who cannot hear well can live full and happy lives. Pet parents can help communicate with their deaf pup by teaching them hand signals for basic commands.",
  "history_description": "The Chinese Crested origin story goes back centuries—long before breed history was meticulously recorded. The prevailing theory is that giant, hairless dogs were shipped from African nations to China, where the dogs were slowly miniaturized through selective breeding.\r\n\r\nAs Chinese Cresteds became more popular in Asia, they were also brought on board trading ships to take care of the rats. After showing up in ships across the world—from North Africa to South America—they became known as \"Chinese Ship Dogs.\" The breed documented in Europe in the 1800s through paintings and photographs is strikingly similar to the Chinese Crested type.\r\n\r\nThe breed was popularized in North America by two dog-loving professionals, Ida Garrett and Debra Woods. Through their observations and communications about Chinese Cresteds, the breed grew in popularity until they were welcomed into the American Kennel Club Stud Book in 1991.\r\n\r\nFun fact: Because of their spellbinding, fantastical appearance (especially that of the hairless variety), some folks refer to this breed as \"The Dr. Seuss Dog.\"\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find a Chinese Crested puppy? You can find reputable breeders at the American Kennel Club's website. The price for a puppy is about $1,200-$2,000, depending on the breeder. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been carefully screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you prefer to adopt, reach out to Chinese Crested rescue organizations and dog shelters, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
