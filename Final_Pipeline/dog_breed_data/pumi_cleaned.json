  "breed_intro": "Don't be fooled by the Pumi's adorable corkscrew curls and toy-like exterior—this active, fun-loving pup comes from a long line of working dogs. Their favorite \"job,\" however, is playtime with you. This curly cutie loves nothing more than to run around and explore, so if you're partial to spending your free time in the Great Outdoors, you've met your match; the Pumi is as high-energy as you are. And if you ever feel a gentle nipping at your ankles, take it as a compliment—you're part of this herding dog's flock, after all!",
  "appearance_description": "Pumi dogs are known for their curved bushy tails and fuzzy double coats of corkscrew curls, which come in a range of colors such as black, fawn, white and gray. While their whimsical-looking eyes and adorable teddy bear looks reveal their playful nature, this dog also boasts a sturdy, muscular frame that hints at their hardworking herding dog past.",
  "temperament_description": "With their alert, playful temperament, the Pumi is always ready for action—especially when it includes their families, toward whom they're incredibly loyal and affectionate. They instinctually take their protection detail very seriously, noisily alerting their pet parents (and likely the whole neighborhood) to anything and everything in the immediate vicinity. But take heart: With good socialization practices and professional Pumi training, you can reduce excessive barking and overreactions to new situations.\r\n\r\nNot exactly social butterflies, Pumik (yes, that's the plural of Pumi) are reserved when it comes to outsiders. All the more reason why these pups must get plenty of socialization, aka positive exposure to all sorts of people and places, starting when they are young dogs. Though they're still likely to be aloof with strangers, they'll be more willing to expand that circle of trust beyond their pet parents and immediate family—great news for your best friend and the local mailman.\r\n\r\nPumik are great with kids, particularly if introduced at a young age, and will match your toddler's energy. Although they're great playmates, watch out for their tendency to herd (nip at kids' heels to round them up). That is what they were initially bred for, after all. The medium-sized Pumi is strong and built to work hard despite looking like a stuffed toy. While having your pet round up the whole brood for dinner may sound appealing, you should train your Pumi using positive reinforcement such as treats, toys and praise to keep undesired instincts at bay. \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of family—that also includes the furry kind. A Pumi is happy to fit in with dogs and even cats, provided they were all raised together from a young age. Introducing a Pumi puppy to existing pets is more manageable than adding an adult Pumi to the mix.\r\n\r\nThey are happiest when keeping active with their family. One of Pumik's strongest traits is their very vocal bark. They will let you know exactly when they're ready for attention, which, let's face it, is practically all the time for these people-loving pets. Parents can keep their dog thriving by engaging their Pumi in vigorous activity, indoors or out. Prepare to play fetch for hours on end with your tireless pet. You can also keep them from barking too much with an assortment of chew toys at their disposal.",
  "care_description": "A Pumi pup is relatively easy to maintain in terms of nutritional needs and grooming, with surprisingly minimal attention needed to keep their distinctive curls in excellent condition. However, they need plenty of mental and physical stimulation, so plan to spend lots of time playing and exercising to create a happy life with your Pumi.",
  "grooming_description": "With their splendid coat of curls, you might assume Pumik need intensive grooming. Here's a pleasant surprise: They actually have average grooming needs. Their double coat doesn't mat easily but does need brushing with a pin brush, which is excellent for removing dirt and debris every one to two weeks. To keep those signature corkscrew curls in top condition, wet the coat after every brush and let it dry naturally. If you blow-dry them, you risk turning those sleek curls into fluff.\n\nPumi shedding is minimal, so congratulations: Your soft furnishings are relatively safe. You can bathe Pumik every three to four weeks, but waiting longer is OK. Washing too frequently risks stripping the coat of its natural oils.\n\nThose furry ears are adorable, but the excess hair growing there can cause trouble. If it grows inside their ears, it can lead to infection. Trim the ears and check them weekly for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \n\nTo keep their gums and teeth healthy, brush them daily using dog toothpaste. Your vet can teach you how to do this to keep both dog and pet parents happy, and they'll also need annual professional teeth cleanings to keep their teeth in top condition. When their nails start clattering across hardwood floors and sidewalks, you'll know it's time for a trim.",
  "training_description": "The Pumi dog breed is eager to please and tends to learn quickly, making these clever pups dream students. They do best with pet parents who have experience training dogs using consistent positive reinforcement (treats, toys and praise). Prior experience with herding breeds is also helpful. All is not lost for first-time pup parents, however. With a bit of patience and the help of a qualified trainer or behaviorist, your Pumi will become a well-trained companion for pet parents with the stamina to keep up.\r\n\r\nThe Pumi's intelligence and enthusiastic nature mean they want to understand why they're doing what's asked of them. They can reason out problems, so don't be afraid of challenging them with more advanced training methods, including dog sports such as flyball or puzzle-solving games, to give them the mental stimulation they need and avoid boredom.\r\n\r\nDespite their cute exterior, the Pumi is a loving but tough working dog, with specific herding behaviors that should shape their training. You should train your Pumi in a way that channels their energy through activities that engage the dog physically and mentally, like agility training. Socialization from an early age is essential to help soften their natural reservedness around strangers and curb excessive barking and ankle-nipping herding tendencies.\r\n\r\nMake sure your Pumi puppy is well-socialized by taking them around town to meet all walks of life and enrolling them in puppy preschool, where their playful nature will have them on their best behavior in no time.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Pumi dogs thrive on a nutritionally balanced, complete, high-quality commercial dog food diet. Before buying, consider your dog's age and choose a formula befitting their particular stage in life, whether puppy, adult or senior.\r\n\r\nWhile they don't have particular dietary needs, it's essential to consult your veterinarian if at any point you think the food you're feeding your Pumi is causing an issue or reaction, or if you're concerned about their weight. Being such an active breed, Pumik aren't generally prone to weight issues. Still, it's important to keep an eye on anything that might impact their health and longevity.\r\n\r\nIf you need to figure out how often and how much to feed your Pumi, your veterinarian can help work out a feeding chart based on your dog's needs and activity levels.",
  "exercise_description": "As a working breed with a ton of energy, Pumik need to keep active. Walks alone aren't enough—they need plenty of mental and physical exercise, at least one or two hours daily. They are at their best when they get a chance to run at full speed on the daily. Heading out to the park, chasing tennis balls and swimming are all great ways to exercise your Pumi and help them work off that energy.\r\n\r\nDue to their intelligence, Pumik adore mentally stimulating games such as hide-and-seek. Frequent family adventures are also a great way to keep these energetic dogs content. They love to be with you on a long walk or run out in nature.",
  "ideal_environment": "Pumik are a great fit for active singles, pet parents or families with kids. They like to stick close to their own family and are protective of everyone in their \"flock,\" two- and four-legged alike, particularly if they have been around the kids and other animals since puppyhood.\r\n\r\nA setting where the Pumi has room to run and explore is best. Homes with a large, fenced backyard or families with access to outdoor spaces are ideal. Apartment living can be tricky—this is a vocal breed that may annoy close neighbors—so if a Pumi pup has already stolen your heart, be sure to enroll them in obedience training from the start to curb the noise.\r\n\r\nPumik also tend to thrive in quiet, relaxed settings, thanks to their reserved nature. They prefer shorter periods away from their family, so if you work long hours or travel extensively, they may not be the breed for you. (Remember, boredom means that your shoes could become chew toys.) Pumik thrive with pet parents who have a flexible schedule and can spend time with them.",
  "health_description": "With a life expectancy of 12 to 13 years, the Pumi is a relatively healthy breed, but there are a few common health issues to watch out for. Luckily, most problems are increasingly rare thanks to sound breeding practices. It’s wise to educate yourself about any potential health problems so you can keep your pet going strong.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is an often-genetic orthopedic condition in which the joints do not fit together properly, resulting in laxity and rubbing. Signs of this condition can vary but can include limping, decreased activity and difficulty running or jumping. Treatment plans range from supplements to weight reduction to surgery in severe cases.\nPatellar Luxation: When a dog’s kneecap (patella) slips out of its joint, it can cause further problems in the joints, hips and legs. Excess weight can factor into luxating patellas, so Pumi weight management is one treatment option. There is also the option of surgery if the problem is more severe.\nDegenerative Myelopathy (DM): A disease that affects the spinal cord, DM causes a dog’s hind limbs to become weaker, eventually leading to paralysis. It is mainly a condition that occurs in older dogs, and while there’s currently no effective treatment for DM, there are actions that can help prolong the quality of a dog’s life, such as physical therapy and weight management. A genetic screening test is available so be sure to ask your breeder.\nPrimary Lens Luxation (PLL): PLL is a rare and inherited condition consisting of the lens migrating within the eye, leading to pain, inflammation and potentially blindness. Thankfully, several PLL treatment options exist, including surgery and topical or oral medications if inflammation is present. There is a genetic screening test so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "The Pumi breed originated in Hungary in the 18th century when the oldest Hungarian herding dog breed, the Puli, was crossbred with other Western European herding dogs and terriers to produce what we now know as the Pumi. The interbreeding resulted in intelligent and driven dogs who worked well at herding livestock and being watchdogs and guard dogs.\r\n\r\nAlthough considered a variety of Puli for many years, at the beginning of the 20th century, a Hungarian breeder decided that a distinction between the two was needed and thus began a program to standardize both the Puli and the Pumi. In 1921, the breeding program succeeded, and the Pumi was finally considered a separate breed from the Puli.\r\n\r\nDespite being a popular breed in their native Hungary and in several other European countries, the Pumi did not become established in the US until the 21st century. The Hungarian Pumi Club of America (HPCA) was founded in 2005, with the breed becoming fully recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2016.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to start your journey as a Pumi pet parent and are wondering about the Pumi price, you can find reputable Pumi breeders at the AKC's website, where you can expect to pay around $2,000 to $2,500 for a purebred puppy. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. As a relatively new breed, finding Pumik at rescue organizations might be a challenge. You can learn more about rescuing or fostering Pumik at the HPCA.",
