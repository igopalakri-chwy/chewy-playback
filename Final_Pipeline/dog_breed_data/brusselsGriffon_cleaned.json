  "breed_intro": "Brussels Griffons (aka \"Griffons\") are instantly recognizable with their smooshy faces and trademark beards. These spunky pups are small in size, but they've got a lively personality and love for their human that's 10 times their size. As consummate \"Velcro dogs,\" their favorite spot is right next to you, whether working from home, out running errands or watching a late-night movie from the couch. One look into their soulful eyes, and you'll be the \"Velcro person\" as you tote this pocket-sized pal everywhere you go.",
  "appearance_description": "The Brussels Griffon is a small, compact breed with a distinctive, expressive face characterized by large, round eyes and a short, smushed nose, that resembles a bat or a monkey. Their coat can be either smooth or rough, and they come in a range of colors from browns to reds to black.",
  "temperament_description": "Brussels Griffons have a friendly, personable temperament, and generally take well to meeting new humans, dogs and cats. As they were originally bred to keep rats and other vermin out of stables, Brussels Griffons may not look so fondly on pets that speak to their inner hunting instinct (we're looking at you, hamsters and gerbils). They're not known to be aggressive or biters, but they can be barkers if not trained properly.\r\n\r\nThe Brussels Griffon breed is active, confident and intelligent. They thrive in environments where they can be physically and mentally active, so if you've ever wanted to see a tiny dog crush an agility course, raising a Brussels Griffon is right up your alley.\r\n\r\nThese \"Velcro dogs\" want nothing more than to be with their special person. That said, they can be good family dogs if the children in the family understand that the Brussels Griffon, while part of the Toy group, isn't actually a toy.",
  "care_description": "Caring for a Brussels Griffons means ensuring they have ample time to get their energy out. This affectionate breed also needs ample amounts of attention. Their grooming and training needs are fairly moderate.",
  "grooming_description": "Regular grooming of a Brussels Griffon is a must to keep your dog happy and healthy.\n\nBrushing: Rough-coated Griffons don't shed but should be hand-stripped about every three months to help keep their coat in good shape. (Hand stripping is where you remove the dead hair either by hand or with a stripping tool.) Brush them a couple of times a week with a pin brush. To maintain their signature beard, use a comb to gently detangle any knots or get rid of any debris they might catch in it. Those with smooth coats will need to be brushed at least twice a week. During shedding season (the spring and fall), they'll need to be brushed daily, preferably with a slicker brush or bristle brush.\n\nBathing: Brussels Griffons should only need a bath every other month. (Unless, of course, they've played in the mud.) Use a dog shampoo, and be sure to read the label because some dog shampoos need to be diluted with water before use. Get more tips from a professional groomer on how to bathe a dog.\n\nNail Trimming: Nail trimming should be included in regular care. Trim their nails every few weeks with a dog nail clipper. When you hear their nails click-clacking on the floor you'll know it's time for a trim.\n\nDental Care: Keep those teeth healthy and dental disease at bay by brushing them daily. Also, make sure you incorporate a professional dental cleaning by your vet at least once a year. (Pro tip: Start brushing your Brussel Griffon's teeth when they are a puppy, and it won't be a struggle when they grow up.)",
  "training_description": "Their energetic and active nature needs an outlet, and Brussels Griffons do well with positive reinforcement training. (Positive reinforcement uses treats, praise and playtime to reward your pup for doing a good job.) Formal training classes can be be useful in training and something to consider. What won't work so well are harsh words and raised voices which can be counter-productive considering their sensitive nature. Instead, approaches such as clicker or treat training will boost their eager-to-please sensibility and praise will resonate strongly with this sharp and perceptive breed.\n\nIt's important to start socializing your Griffon as a puppy to bring out a more amiable personality. Take them on walks and let them safely explore different environments. Consider enrolling them in puppy kindergarten. This is a great place for your Brussels Griffon puppy to learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet and interact with other adults. Win, win!",
  "diet_nutrition": "Brussels Griffons, like most breeds, need a balanced diet to keep in tip-top shape. They typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food, and as a pet parent, you should be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). As Griffons may respond well to training when using treats, don't forget those treats are calories and should be factored into their overall daily nutrition. If you have questions about your Brussels Griffon dog's food, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Don't let the diminutive stature of a Brussels Griffon fool you into thinking these pups are docile little lapdogs. They have a high energy level, along with deceptive speed, and will need time to frolic and play at least once a day for 30 minutes to really stretch their legs. Griffons enjoy energetic walks as well as slower walks that allow them time to explore the world through their nose. If you have a competitive streak, you and your pup may enjoy dog sports, like agility or tracking.\r\n\r\nThese toy dogs were originally bred as hunters for mice and vermin, and any activity that lets them track or hunt will be a delight for your pup. For example, you can hide treats under an old Chewy box and let them hunt for the snack. And consider leaving a few puzzle toys around the house for your pup to entertain themselves throughout the day.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Brussels Griffon is a pretty adaptable little dog. They do well in smaller homes, like apartments, because of their small size, as long as they have outlets for their energy.  They also do well with cats and dogs, and can be good family dogs with children who respect tehir boundaries. What they aren't flexible on? Needing a pet parent who appreciates having a constant canine around, as this is an affectionate breed who bonds strongly to their people.",
  "health_description": "Brussels Griffons have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years. As playful and loyal as these pups are, they’re generally healthy but do have some health issues that pet parents need to be aware of.\r\n\n \t• Breathing Issues: While part of the Brussels Griffon’s utter adorableness is their flattened face (brachycephalic), that same characteristic can equal breathing problems for the breed, especially in hot weather. Be sure to keep your pup indoors with the AC cranked during hot days and give them lots of fresh, cool water to drink.\nJoint Issues: Hip dysplasia is a health problem when the hip joint is malformed and can cause your pup to have lameness and pain. It’s also not uncommon for Griffons to have patellar luxation, or kneecap dislocation. Treatment for both includes weight management, physical therapy and surgery, depending on the severity.\nEye Issues: While their wide, searching eyes are what so many people love about the Brussels Griffon, it is a fact that those eyes can also cause big problems for the small pups. Their eyes can be prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which eventually can lead to blindness. This breed is also prone to cataracts in older dogs. There is no treatment for PRA, but surgery may be possible with cataracts.",
  "history_description": "Originating in the early 1800s from Brussels, Belgium—where they are known as Griffon Bruxellois—the Brussels Griffon is the result of crossbreeding the Affenpinscher with several other breeds, including Pugs, King Charles Spaniels and English Toy Spaniels. (The coachmen and stablemen who had a hand in the breeding didn't keep clear records).\r\n\r\nThese small dogs are tiny but mighty and originally bred as ratters, i.e., to keep rats and other small vermin out of stables. Around 1870, however, history notes they got a boost out of the stables and into the lap of luxury when Queen Henrietta Maria of Belgium couldn't resist the smushed faces of the Brussels Griffon breed and made them a household name. That also paved the way for official recognition by the American Kennel Club (AKC), which registered the first Brussels Griffon in 1910. In 1982, the American Brussels Griffon Association was elected to AKC membership.\r\n\r\nWhile their origin moved quickly up the ranks from stable to castle, today's dogs are most known for their pouty faces and loving, longing eyes that people can't seem to resist. And their intelligence and playfulness make them stars—literally! If this sweet pup's face seems familiar, and you're a fan of Jack Nicholson films, you may recognize the Brussels Griffon as the dog who stole the show in the movie \"As Good As It Gets.\"\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find Brussels Griffon puppies today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club website. What's the average Brussels Griffon price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend about $1,500 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Brussels Griffon rescue organizations to adopt one of these pups, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database for adoptable Brussels Griffons in your area..",
