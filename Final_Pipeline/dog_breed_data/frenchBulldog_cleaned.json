  "coat_length": "The French Bulldog's coat is dense, short and smooth. It's not overly thick or fluffy.  Be wary of dogs sold as 'fluffy French Bulldogs,' as a French Bulldog with long fur isn't a purebred. French Bulldogs don't have the gene for that coat length, which means breeders who advertise these dogs are likely breeding French Bulldogs with other breeds, such as Pomeranians or Long-coated Chihuahuas. As with any breeding situation, do diligent research before you buy: Try to meet your potential puppy's parents, and be sure your breeder acquires health clearances on all their dogs.",

  "breed_intro": "A French Bulldog is the kind of friend who is always ready to hang out. A casual walk? Great! A lazy afternoon with Netflix set to autoplay? Fantastic! They're up for whatever (as long as it's not running a marathon). They'll happily snooze the day away on a plush bed and convince you to do the same, but also love romping with dog friends and playing fetch. When you're out on the town, prepare to be the center of attention'it's inevitable with a bat-eared, smooshy-faced French Bulldog in tow.",
  "appearance_description": "The French Bulldog is a compact but strong and powerful dog with a large head. Frenchies have big, round eyes, bat-like ears, and as a brachycephalic dog breed, they have a flat face with adorable wrinkles.",
  "temperament_description": "They don't call 'em bulldogs for nothing! French Bulldogs have a headstrong temperament'think of them as strong-willed. These small dogs think they're big dogs, which is why it's important for French Bulldog puppies to receive training and socialization early on. That will help them feel comfortable and friendly toward visitors (human or animal) who come to their home. Otherwise, they may be standoffish with strangers.\n\nBut make no mistake'French Bulldogs are friendly dogs who bond deeply with their people and love to have a good time. Because of those deep bonds, they can feel neglected and anxious when their people are out of the house for too long. If you've ever experienced missing someone even before they're gone, then you can relate to how Frenchies feel.\n\nSpeaking of their people, the French Bulldog breed is good with kids and babies, but as with any dog, they should always be supervised and taught how to interact with dogs. They also get along with other dogs and cats, as long as you introduce them properly.\n\nThe French Bulldog is primarily a companion dog. You're unlikely to see them helping first responders, but their unconditional affection makes them amazing emotional support and therapy dogs in hospitals and care homes. They also make good watch dogs, often barking if someone new is at the door.",
  "care_description": "French Bulldogs are easy to have around. Sure, they need solid training ground rules, but they aim to please and their short coats are easy to brush. With the help of your veterinarian (and maybe a certified dog trainer to guide you along the way), you can successfully navigate your dog's individual needs and personality.",
  "grooming_description": "French Bulldogs are an easy-to-groom, short-coated breed. We've broken grooming tasks down by frequency:\n\nDaily:\n\nThe shape of their head and body means they may have trouble keeping themselves clean. Clean their face folds and eyes every day. They might also need an occasional assist to keep their bums clean.\n\nBrush your pup's teeth every day. Regular tooth care is essential to your dog's long-term health and quality of life. Introducing the process to your French Bulldog as a puppy will make the task more manageable in the long run. And don't forget their annual professional dental cleaning by your veterinarian.\n\nWeekly:\n\nYou'll likely only need to brush your French Bulldog once a week with a grooming glove or simple bristle brush. Yes they shed, but they don't shed as much compared to other breeds like Boston Terriers or Pugs. Brushing will help reduce the amount of loose hair you find around the house.\n\nMORE: A Complete Guide to Brushing a Dog the Right Way, According to a Pro Groomer\n\nAnother weekly task to stay on top of is checking their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. They may recommend at-home cleaning.\n\nOccasionally:\n\nUnless they get exceptionally dirty, Frenchies only need a bath about once every 1-3 months. (Get the how-to here.) Overbathing removes the natural oils from their coat and skin. Between baths, you can keep them clean with a damp washcloth or cleaning wipes.\n\nTrim their nails as needed. How do you know it's time to trim? You'll hear their nails clicking on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "One of the keys to training a French Bulldog can be summed up in two words: start early. Don't be fooled by the breed's small size and cute appearance'they can be headstrong and become overstimulated or react toward other dogs without immediate, consistent training and socialization. They have to learn to control their 'bullish' behaviors, or they may confuse or provoke other dogs.\n\nFrenchies respond well to positive reinforcement'think treats, toys and praise. If they get frustrated during training sessions, take a break. (We all need one now and then.) These intelligent, sensitive pups are eager to please their humans, and are motivated by food, two attributes that will help you achieve your training goals.\n\nMORE: Your Essential Guide to Basic Dog Obedience Training",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best source for information about your French Bulldog's nutritional needs and overall diet is your vet. Typically, they do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nSome Frenchies are prone to obesity, especially since exercise can be difficult due to their flat faces. Collaborate with your veterinarian to find the right combination of quality food and regular exercise. Keep an eye on the scale and adjust amounts as needed. A treat once in a while is fine and helps with training, but remember: treats equal extra calories!\r\n\r\nHave more questions about what to feed your French Bulldog?

  "exercise_description": "French Bulldogs aren't exactly the Olympians of the dog world, but they still need exercise. With their short legs, large bodies and flat faces, these dogs are more suited to brisk exercise rather than distance running. Opt for a game of fetch in the yard or a nice walk around the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBe sure to keep an eye on their breathing while they exercise. As a brachycephalic (flat-faced) dog breed, Frenchies are prone to airway issues (more on Brachycephalic syndrome in the Dog Health section below). And don't forget your pup's mental stimulation; dog puzzles, scent work and simply getting out and exploring the world will help enrich their mind.",
  "ideal_environment": "French Bulldogs can adapt to many home situations. They can handle life in a city apartment as well as life in a small-town or a rural country homestead. As long as they have your company and a time and a place for exercising, they'll thrive.\n\nTwo things they cannot handle well: extreme hot or cold. Frenchies prefer a moderate climate. During hot spells, bring them outside during the cooler parts of the day and consider buying a few products to help them keep cool and prevent heatstroke. In the winter, limit outside time and consider keeping your pup warm in a cute dog coat or dog sweater.\n\nWith all their needs and personality quirks, does that mean you have to be an experienced dog owner to have a Frenchie? Not necessarily. French Bulldogs are a good choice for first-time pet parents, if you can commit to their training'the earlier, the better. With proper training and socialization, they'll be happy to adjust to your lifestyle and social schedule.\n\nJust don't leave them alone for hours at a time. Frenchies prefer to be with you as much as possible. If you have to be gone for long, check them into doggy day care or arrange for a neighbor or pet sitter to come play with them.",
  "health_description": "With good food and exercise (and common sense on your part), the French Bulldog lifespan is about 10 to 12 years. Unfortunately, they suffer from some health issues. Be aware of these concerns, so you can help your pup live a long, happy life.\r\n\r\n \tAllergies: Allergies are a common condition with French Bulldogs and can be caused by seasonal allergies (dust, pollen, mold) or food allergies. Allergies often show up as itchiness. If you suspect your pet has allergies, please schedule a visit with your veterinarian.\r\n \tSkin Infections: Those charming face wrinkles can trap bits of food and moisture (so gross!). Bacteria can multiply there, leading to skin infections. Keep infections at bay by cleaning your dog's folds every day. If you see signs of infection (irritated, red, or swollen skin), visit your vet.\r\n \tBrachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS): One well-known Frenchie trait is their 'snorting/snuffling/snoring' sounds; some pet parents even consider them endearing. While these noises may seem harmless, the fact is their physical attributes cause them health problems. Brachycephalic breeds (flat-faced dogs) may develop difficulty breathing during exercise because of the smooshed anatomy of their nostrils, airways and soft palettes. You can manage symptoms by keeping your dog at a healthy weight, but severe cases might require surgery.\r\n \tEar Infections: French Bulldogs are somewhat prone to ear infections (their ear canals are narrow). If your dog suffers from frequent ear infections, your veterinarian can show you how to properly and safely clean the ears to help prevent future infections.\r\n \tSpine and Orthopedic Issues: Your French Bulldog may also be susceptible to common issues like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), hip dysplasia and patellar luxation. IVDD is a disease of the spinal cord. Depending on the severity, pain meds or surgery can be used to treat the condition. Hip dysplasia is when the hip joint doesn't fit properly. Treatment can range from weight management to physical therapy to surgery. Patellar luxation is a knee issue where the kneecap slips out. Keeping your pup at a healthy weight is your first line of defense; severe cases might require surgery.\r\n \tEye Problems: The French Bulldog dog breed is susceptible to common eye issues, including cataracts and cherry eye. Cataracts, a cloudy lens, can cause blindness, but surgery can often correct it. Cherry eye is a condition when the third eyelid slips out of place and swells, which is also typically treated with surgery.",
  "history_description": "Here's a surprise: The French Bulldog actually originated in England. They were developed as a smaller type of Bulldog (aka English Bulldog) and were popular with people in the lace-making industry in the 1800s. Gaining notoriety for their temperament in Nottingham, a center for lace-making, they became a bit of a lace-maker mascot. After the Industrial Revolution changed the lace-making industry, many lace-makers moved to France, where their diminutive bulldogs became fashionable. French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec even included the French Bulldog in his art.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1800s, Americans began taking notice of the charming bat-eared dogs, and established the French Bull Dog Club of America in 1897. There was a bit of controversy regarding bat ears versus 'rose ears,' which start upright, then fall to the side and back (the ear interior looks like a rose). American French Bulldog enthusiasts favored the bat ears, and as in France, the French Bulldog became fashionable in the United States, especially among socialites.\r\n\r\nFollowing World War II, their popularity decreased, but experienced a steady rise until the 1960s and eventually surging in the 1990s. The breed catapulted (dog-apulted?) to the No. 2 spot on the American Kennel Club's list of Most Popular Dog Breeds in 2020.\r\n\r\nConsidering a French Bulldog as a pet? Find a list of reputable French Bulldog breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000-plus for a pup. Be sure the breeder you buy from screens their dogs for health and temperament issues.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to French Bulldog rescues (find an organization via Chewy's Shelter and Rescue Network) or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, though know that you don't often see the breed in multi-breed shelters, as most reputable French Bulldog breeders will take the dogs they sell back from families who no longer desire their pet. If you're open to adopting a 3-4-year-old dog, reach out to local breeders and ask about their retired female dogs. Breeders often spay their females after two litters and then find them loving permanent homes.",
