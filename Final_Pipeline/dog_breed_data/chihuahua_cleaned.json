  "breed_intro": "A large dog in a small dog's body, the Chihuahua is a toy breed with a great big heart and an even bigger personality. This tiny lap dog is like a little magnet, attracting many admirers with their small stature, soulful eyes and expressive ears. But while the Chihuahua breed is affectionate and bonded to their humans, they can react with force when they feel intimidated by strangers, so proper socialization and training is a must. Equal parts sassy and sweet, these pint-sized pups make great companions for first-time and experienced pet parents alike.",
  "appearance_description": "One of the smallest breeds, the Chihuahua has a head shaped like an apple with erect, expressive ears and large, luminous eyes that practically drip with emotion above a short, slightly pointed muzzle. They're dainty yet surprisingly sturdy and can have short (smooth coat) or long hair, which comes in a variety of colors, from white to black and nearly every other color in between. (Fun fact: The American Kennel Club recognizes nearly 30 colors and 11 different types of markings.)",
  "temperament_description": "Chihuahuas are charming little scamps with an eye for mischief and a sense of bravery that outsizes their physicality. They're playful pups who enjoy a good romp or game, even though it may not last long (depending on their energy level). And they love to snooze on laps and cuddle'that is, after all, what they're bred to do.\n\nThey like a lot of attention and are quite portable. But even though they're easily carried, they do still need to learn how to walk on their own and be able to engage in normal dog behaviors, like sniffing, exploring and playing. In other words, don't pop them in a purse or a stroller and tote them everywhere'unless, of course, it's somewhere risky with lots of feet that could hurt a tiny paw, like an airport or street festival.\n\nThe Chihuahua dog breed is said to resemble a terrier with their demeanor and can become quite feisty, especially if they feel threatened. Some sites report that the Chihuahua bite force is 3,900 pounds per square inch (psi), but those so-called Chihuahua facts are wildly inaccurate, when a lion is only at 600 psi. In truth, Chihuahuas usually inflict no more than a Level 1-3 bite, with no puncture deeper than half the length of one of their canine teeth.\n\nTo help your Chihuahua puppy overcome a nipping or protective tendency, socialize them by safely and slowly introducing them to new people and places from the get-go and start training when they are young. Early training will also help this smallest of dog breeds become wonderfully friendly and receptive to all members of the family, including other pets.",
  "care_description": "A Chihuahua puppy or adult, with their petite proportions and ease of portability, is easy to think of as low maintenance. In reality, Chihuahuas require daily exercise, regular grooming with special attention to dental and eye care, and early socialization and training. They are dogs'not toys'after all. The good news is they are so little, that grooming doesn't take very long to get through. And they're smart dogs who take well to proper training and socialization.",
  "grooming_description": "A Chihuahua's grooming needs tend to be on the low to average side, depending on whether they're long- or short-haired. Here are some grooming tips to keep in mind:\n\n \tBrushing and bathing: Both coat types need regular brushing and bathing.\n\n \tFor short-haired types, brushing your pup once a week is sufficient.\n \tFor long-haired Chihuahuas, brushing and trimming, especially on the legs and tail, are extra-important so the fur doesn't become matted. Brushing three times a week is a good goal. Just don't shave your Chihuahua in warm weather. The fur actually protects them from the sun and heat, and removing too much of it can result in sunburns and heatstroke.\n \tWhen grooming, pay careful attention to a Chihuahua's eyes. Their full, round eyes lend themselves to eye problems, especially toward the middle and later years of their lives. Take note of any squinting, swelling, rubbing, pawing, discharge or irritation in general. Eye problems range from common issues, such as dry eye, to more serious ones like glaucoma. (More on that below.)\n\n\n \tBathing: To keep them fresh and clean, one bath a month will usually suffice, unless your pup has taken a roll in the mud.\n \tDental care: Routine dental care is important as dental disease is commonly seen in Chihuahuas. Brush your dog's teeth daily to reduce the chances of dental disease and keep up with their professional dental cleanings (performed by your vet annually). You want to get them used to teeth brushing when they're puppies so they don't fight it when they're older. Get a groomer or your vet to show you how to navigate those little Chihuahua teeth safely.",
  "training_description": "Despite the Chihuahua's terrier-like reputation, their intelligence makes them willing students for training, which they should start as puppies to prevent unwanted behaviors, such as growling, biting and resource guarding. Like teenagers, they will challenge the boundaries you set for them. Use positive reinforcement training methods to encourage the behaviors you'd like to see and to teach your Chi basic commands, like sit and stay. Early socialization'which entails slowly and safely introducing your young pup to new people, places and things'will help your dog be more flexible, adaptable and relaxed as an adult.\n\nThe Chihuahua bark is somewhat notorious. These dogs will alert you to everything they hear. Consult a certified dog trainer or certified behaviorist to reduce their sensitivity and reactivity. You can't entirely train the bark out of them'Chihuahuas like the sound of their own voice'but you can minimize the behavior with counter-conditioning and desensitization. Still, you should be willing to accept your Chihuahua for the potentially chatty canine they are.\n\nWhile Chihuahuas are poor choices for a service dog given their size, they make good emotional support animals for pet parents because of how bonded they become to their humans.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Feed your Chihuahua a high-quality dog food. To make sure it fits the bill, look for a statement on the package that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). When feeding dry dog food, look for a smaller-sized kibble to fit in their smaller mouths. They also may benefit from a food formulated for Chihuahuas (like Royal Canin Chihuahua dry dog food) or small-breed dogs in general because those are designed to meet their specific needs.\r\n\r\nA common problem with very small dogs like the Chihuahua is overfeeding. Be careful not to overdo it'especially when it comes to treats'and, again, make sure they are being fed a healthy, complete diet. A 6-pound dog, ideally, should receive about 225 calories per day (including treats); if 50 calories of that are not nutritionally appropriate, that's about one-quarter of the dog's food.\r\n\r\nIt's best to talk to your veterinarian who can recommend the best food, portion size and feeding schedule for your pet, based on their individual weight, activity level and age.",
  "exercise_description": "Even though they are small, Chihuahuas still need regular exercise. Daily short walks are a must. Take your pup on a walk around the block or even in the backyard. Strenuous exercise like long-distance running is not recommended as they can tire easily and they're prone to knee problems. (More on that below.)\r\n\r\nMany Chihuahuas do not get enough exercise for their needs, even though they're easily met. That's because they're so tiny, pet parents tend to carry them more than they should. So make sure they get time to walk and run around on their own four little legs. For both physical and mental stimulation, consider buying interactive small dog toys to keep them entertained.",
  "ideal_environment": "Because of their compact size, the Chihuahua does really well in city environments. These medium-energy dogs get a workout simply by following their pet parents around the home. (Every step of yours is five to six for a Chichi.) That doesn't mean the Chihuahua can't do well in a suburban or rural neighborhood. Just be careful not to leave them outside and unattended. Even with a fenced yard, the dogs are tiny enough to become prey for a passing hawk or eagle.\r\n\r\nChihuahuas are best suited for adults or families with older children. They are delicate, so small children picking them up can accidentally drop them, causing fractures. Chihuahuas can be headstrong, stubborn or nippy, especially when you try to remove them from a favorite spot'or person.",
  "health_description": "Even though they have a life expectancy of 14-16 years, Chihuahuas are not without their health problems. Like many dogs who have been bred for millennia, Chihuahuas come with their own unique set of health issues. \r\n\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: Also known as luxating patella, this condition occurs when the kneecaps slip or dislocate. Treatment may range from joint supplements and pain medication to surgery, in severe cases.  \r\n \tHypoglycemia (low blood sugar): Because tiny dogs have very little fat storage, their blood sugar bottoms out easily. Symptoms include lack of energy, weakness, disorientation, tremors and, in severe cases, seizures. To help your Chi avoid developing hypoglycemia, you may need to offer multiple small meals throughout the day, especially when they're puppies. \r\n \tBladder Stones: The Chihuahua is more likely than other breeds to develop bladder stones. Symptoms include smelly or bloody urine, inability to urinate, frequent urination and accidents in the house. Surgery may be required to remove the stones. To prevent them or minimize your Chi's chance of developing bladder stones, talk with your veterinarian about possible changes to your pup's diet. \r\n \tPortosystemic Shunt (PSS): In this disorder, the blood supply that's supposed to go to the liver is shunted or diverted. Then, toxins build up. If your Chihuahua is not growing properly or has seizures, make sure your vet checks for this condition, which is typically treated with diet and medication or, in severe cases, surgery. \r\n \tHeart Disease and Other Cardiac Issues: Heart disease is a leading cause of death for this smallest breed. Chihuahuas are susceptible to several conditions, including mitral valve disease and Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA). Symptoms include coughing, fatigue, weakness, a heart murmur and weight loss. If you suspect your Chihuahua is having issues with their heart or your vet hears a heart murmur, they may need to see a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).  \r\n \tHydrocephalus: Because of the shape of their heads, Chihuahuas are susceptible to improperly fused skull bones which can lead to excess fluid around the brain.  This can result in an increase in intracranial pressure. Symptoms include seizures, circling and an improper gait. When caught early, medications can often be used to treat the condition. In some instances, surgery is needed. \r\n \tEpilepsy: Chihuahuas can have seizures for several reasons, but if there's no underlying disorder, then idiopathic epilepsy may be diagnosed. Treatment is typically daily medication.  \r\n \tEye Issues: Chihuahuas have big puppy dog eyes, making them more prone to eye issues. Common eye issues include dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS), glaucoma, cataracts and corneal ulcers. If you notice any signs of eye problems, such as redness, cloudiness, squinting, bulging or pain, please see your veterinarian immediately.  \r\n \tPeriodontal Disease: Extremely common in Chihuahuas by the age of 2, periodontal disease begins with tartar build-up and leads to gum infections and tooth loss. If not treated, the bacteria can get in the blood stream and affect the heart, liver and kidneys. Daily teeth brushing and regular dental checkups by your vet are key to preventing this disease.",
  "history_description": "Chihuahua history is ancient. The Chihuahua dog breed is named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where they originated and may have developed from the Techichi, the tiny dog kept by the Toltecs as early as the 9th century AD. However, one clear distinction between the Techichi and the Chihuahua: The Techichi was essentially mute, and the Chihuahua is, well, clearly not.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting Chihuahua fact: While the American Kennel Club did not officially recognize Chihuahuas as a breed until 1904, they were first noticed in the mid-19th century. And while they were isolated from other breeds for 9,000 years or more until Mexico was colonized, modern Chihuahuas retain four percent of their Chihuahua original genes that predate contact with European dogs.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Chihuahua puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Chihuahua breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Chihuahua price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $500 to $1,500 for a pup, with the average dog going for $800. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Chihuahua rescue organizations to adopt a Chihuahua, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

    {
      "question": "Are Chihuahuas hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Chihuahua dogs are not hypoallergenic. Some people think that the short-haired (smooth coat) Chihuahua is easier than the long-haired (long coat) for those who have allergic symptoms to dogs, but that's not true. The Chihuahua sheds a low to moderate amount, and dander (and even their saliva) are what triggers an allergic reaction. The AKC does not list the Chihuahua as one of its recommended hypoallergenic breeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Chihuahuas swim?",
      "answer": "Yes, like almost all dog breeds, Chihuahuas swim instinctively. Are they the best swimmers? No. While they don't sink like Bulldogs, they weren't bred for the water. So, some like it and some don't. However your Chihuahua takes to water, remember their little limbs will tire easily."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should a Chihuahua weigh?",
      "answer": "The AKC breed standard for a Chihuahua's weight is 4-6 pounds. Any larger than that is a flaw. Many Chihuahua pet parents overfeed their toy breeds. It's important to remember that the smaller the dog, the less they need to eat. Quality more than quantity is the key."
