  "breed_intro": "It can be hard to see a Puli's eyes through their corded fur—but that doesn't mean a Puli can't see yours. And you know what? They love what they see. Pulik (the plural term for these devoted dogs) are ready to play at the word go. You can expect this super clever—and sometimes sneaky—breed to figure out how to get you off the couch and into the Great Outdoors. The Puli is perfect for you if you're a kid at heart—they remain playful and curious long after puppyhood.",
  "appearance_description": "With their long cords of fur, the Puli dog certainly has a unique look. This signature coat style is naturally occurring (with a bit of grooming help from you) thanks to the breed's soft, wooly and dense undercoat, and comes in black, gray and white. When you can see their eyes, you'll notice the Puli always watches and observes their surroundings, drawing on a deep herding instinct.",
  "temperament_description": "Just like you, the Puli is one of a kind. With their unmistakable long cords (which people sometimes mistake for dreadlocks), a fun-loving but sometimes ornery attitude and eager-to-please personality, Pulik are loyal dogs who live for fun with their favorite human (that's you!).\n\nThe Puli breed has its roots in Hungarian sheepherding, and today, the herding instinct remains strong. That means early socialization and basic obedience training (skills like sit, stay and come) are essential to raising a confident adult Puli dog. This intelligent breed loves using their brains, so they're also happy to learn advanced skills.\n\nThough strong-willed, thanks to being bred to work independently, Pulik are dedicated to their family. They are naturally protective and can be wary of strangers, which makes them good guarding dogs. However, they generally get along well with people (once they get to know them) and other dogs. The downside to having the long corded fur is that when it covers their eyes and disguises the tail and ears of the Puli, it can be difficult for other dogs to read their body language—the primary way dogs communicate. If only dogs could pass notes to each other. (\"I like you, do you like me? Check a box: Yes or No.\")\n\nA Puli dog can live with a cat; it helps if they grow up together and pet parents set boundaries to prevent the dog from giving into their herding instincts and chasing the cat. Same with young children—your Puli may try to keep your children from straying too far away or wandering around the house, but training can help. Children in your Puli's life should also be taught to play respectfully with dogs.\n\nPulik need a lot of mental and physical stimulation—no couch potatoes allowed, and don't be stingy with the walks, either! Long walks, puzzle toys in the house, or an agility or herding dog class will keep your Puli satisfied and help them put their best paw forward daily.",
  "care_description": "The most significant aspect of Puli breed grooming is that their long, corded fur requires daily care. Even if you decide to leave the coat shaggy, you'll still have to brush it at least weekly. The breed also has higher daily exercise needs than many other breeds. Pulik are generally healthy dogs that can live into their teens with the proper nutrition and care.",
  "grooming_description": "If your daily hair care routine takes longer than the average sitcom, you can probably relate to what a Puli needs to keep their locks looking lovely. Grooming a Puli is a serious time commitment, though not due to shedding—these dogs are not known to shed a lot. However, once your Puli puppy hits 8 to 10 months of age, their wooly and dense undercoat starts to develop. If you want to keep your pup in their distinctive corded coat, you'll have to help separate the clumps of hair to form the cords with your fingers.\n\nCords are essentially \"mats\" that have historically helped the breed stay warm while herding sheep during the frigid winter. The cords take about five years to grow out and reach the ground and require daily care. You'll need to check the cords to ensure the mats don't clump together and cause problems like skin lesions. You can use a bristle brush or your fingers.\n\nIf you're not into the corded look, you can brush out your pup's coat weekly with a pin brush. (No skipping, or the coat will start to cord.) Work in sections and brush away from the dog (there's so much fur!). Spray with water or a conditioner to prevent coat breakage after brushing the area.\n\nYour Puli will only need a bath every six to eight weeks, some even less often. When you do bathe your Puli, check their cords afterward to make sure they are completely dry, as wet cords can cause skin problems.\n\nAside from the fur, there are a few other grooming tasks. Clip their nails before they get long enough to touch the floor (every two to four weeks). You should also check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \n\nExperts recommend you brush your dog's teeth daily to stop plaque and tartar from building up. Periodontal disease can lead to a loss of teeth and even more severe issues like heart, liver and kidney disease. In addition to regular brushings at home, take your dog to the vet for annual dental cleanings with a professional.",
  "training_description": "Pulik are an intelligent breed who love to learn and are naturally curious. Pair that with tons of energy, and you have a dog who requires training and looks forward to it. They're so bright, in fact, that some pet parents might say their Puli can be a little manipulative to get things to go their way. (Hey, if you were this cute, wouldn't you use it to your advantage too?)\r\n\r\nPulik can be headstrong and super focused on what they're doing, so they need a dedicated and consistent pet parent. Good initial commands include the basics (sit, stay, come) and cues such as \"leave it.\" Working on agility skills to build your dog's confidence appropriately can be helpful, too.\r\n\r\nLike other breeds, Pulik learn best with positive reinforcement training (treats, toys and praise for good behavior) to help them develop confidence and look forward to training.\r\n\r\nSince Pulik are reserved around people they don't know, it's important to start socializing them, aka introducing them to new people and experiences, when they're puppies, to help them learn that different people and situations are ordinary. Take your puppy on walks and let them meet the people and dogs you encounter. Enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet pup parents in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Puli typically does well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior).\r\n\r\nBecause Pulik are so active and always on the go, they may benefit from high-protein dog food or different serving sizes than recommended. And remember to factor in treats! Those little nibbles also count toward your Puli's daily caloric intake. If you think you're pup's gaining a little extra weight (and it's not just those cords!), chat with your vet. They can help you create a mealtime and exercise plan to help your pup lose the extra weight and maintain their nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "You know daily exercise is good for you, but it's a must for your Puli. The Puli is a herding breed requiring tons of mental and physical activity. But don't worry if you're not going to make the Olympics for the 100-yard dash—these dogs aren't known for their speed. Your Puli will do best with one to two hours of daily exercise, whether a long walk, hike, (slow) run or an agility/herding class. You may want to invest in an extra pair of athletic shoes because lazy days are few and far between with a Puli in your life.\r\n\r\nPulis also need to use their brains with things like puzzle toys and will let you know if they aren't getting enough stimulation by finding a way to get into trouble. Another way to incorporate using their brain into daily life is with a slow feeder bowl, which turns mealtimes into a fun and challenging puzzle.",
  "ideal_environment": "If they get enough exercise, a Puli can thrive in whatever size home you've got. While they'll be happiest if they can embrace their herding instincts in a class or on a farm, your Puli will love roaming a large yard or any ample, fenced-in space you can access.\r\n\r\nPuli dogs are utterly dedicated to their families. They can be wary of strangers, so if yours is the party house, know that your Puli won't make the rounds with drinks and appetizers like a Labrador Retriever might. However, with proper socialization, you can help your pup be more comfortable with social situations.\r\n\r\nThe Puli's natural herding traits come out with children and cats. Still, if your Puli puppy grows up learning to respect boundaries, they will likely be a well-behaved adult dog.",
  "health_description": "A Puli’s life expectancy is 10 to 15 years. They are generally healthy, but if you get your puppy from a breeder, ensure they follow the Puli Club of America guidelines and screen for common health issues.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a genetic condition in which the hip joint doesn’t form properly. It can cause lameness and pain in your dog. Many treatments and therapies are available, including weight management, restricting activities, physical therapy and medication. Sometimes, surgery is required.\nPatellar Luxation: Patellar luxation is common in small to medium-sized dogs. It occurs when a dog’s kneecap slips out of the joint, which can cause arthritis or joint problems in the hips and other legs. You can manage it by keeping your dog at a healthy weight and curtailing strenuous exercise if it’s not severe. If it becomes severe, surgery may be necessary.\nDegenerative Myelopathy: Degenerative myelopathy is a disease that affects the spinal cord. It slowly progresses, causing weakness and paralysis in a dog’s back legs. It is similar to Lou Gehrig’s Disease in humans and is most common in middle-aged dogs. There is no effective cure, but managing the weight of your Puli and keeping them as active as possible can help.\nEye Problems: Pulis can develop cataracts, which cloud the eye and lead to blindness. Surgery may be an option for cataracts. They can also inherit progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which causes the dog to go blind. There is currently no treatment for PRA, but pet parents can make accommodations to help dogs who lose their vision, such as avoiding changing the layout of their homes.",
  "history_description": "While no one knows the Pulik's origin for sure, it's thought the breed was brought to Europe more than a thousand years ago by a nomadic tribe called the Magyars in the region now known as Hungary. The breed herded flocks of sheep on the Hungarian plains, developing its trademark corded coat to help protect them from frigid winters.\r\n\r\nStarting in the 17th century, the number of Pulik dwindled and almost disappeared, but Dr. Emil Raitsits, professor at the Hungarian University of Veterinarian Medicine, revived the breeding of Pulik and established the breed standard between 1912-1915 so they didn't become a lost part of canine history.\r\n\r\nThe Puli was brought to the United States in 1935 as part of a study by the US Department of Agriculture to find a breed that wouldn't harm the animals they were supposed to be herding. They mixed Pulik with other breeds and kept some purebred, but the program yielded nothing definitive. After World War II, the Pulik were auctioned off to breeders, becoming the pets we know today.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Puli in 1936. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. Working with a reputable breeder usually means you're getting a Puli puppy who's been screened for health problems and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Puli can range from $1,200 to $2,000. You can also contact the Puli Club of America Rescue Trust, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
