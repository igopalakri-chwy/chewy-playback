  "breed_intro": "Great Danes want to be in the middle of everything, so chances are you’ll find them trying to “help” in the kitchen, trying to nap on your lap (you wanted a 140-pound lapdog, right?), or trying to say “I love you” with their trademark “lean.”  \n\nElegant yet silly, these delightful giants are simply impossible to ignore—and who would want to? Known for carrying themselves with dignity (even if those jowls are hard to take seriously), Great Danes also have a goofy side that comes out around the people they love the most.",
  "appearance_description": "The Great Dane size is their most obvious physical trait; they’re one of the tallest dog breeds, standing an impressive 28 inches (at least) with all four paws on the ground.  \n\nThey have long, floppy ears and adorably droopy jowls. Yet, they also possess a distinct elegance and dignified air that comes with a side of mischief and humor.",
  "temperament_description": "A Great Dane’s size might be intimidating at first, but their personality is anything but. They’re loyal, kind, and eager to make you as happy as they are.  \n\nIf you thought only pint-sized pups could be Velcro dogs, think again. Great Danes love to keep you in their line of sight. Consider it an honor that they love you enough to follow you anywhere (even to the bathroom). And don’t be surprised if your Great Dane tries their best to be a lap dog. \n\nGreat Danes may seem shy, aloof, or reserved at first, but that’s usually because they haven’t gotten to know you yet. Socializing your dog at an early age will help them become more comfortable around new people and other four-legged creatures.  \n\nGreat Danes have a deep, powerful bark that can be jarring for visitors or even their parents, but it’s just their way of alerting you to something they think is very important. They can’t help that they’re a tad loud, after all.",
  "care_description": "These pups have minimal grooming needs, which will give you time to focus on training your Great Dane so they grow into a happy, well-mannered dog.",
  "grooming_description": "Great Danes don’t take a lot of time to groom. But they are known for occasional drooling, so you may want to have a towel handy to keep their face (and your furniture) slobber-free. \r\n\n\t• Bathing: A good scrub every couple of months is ideal, but your dog may need a bath more frequently if they have skin issues or play in the mud a lot. You can keep them clean in between baths with shampoo wipes. \nBrushing: Brush your Great Dane once a week. A good curry brush works well. Even with their short coat, Great Danes do shed, but brushing should keep that under control. \nDental care: Brush your pup’s teeth daily to help keep their teeth and gums healthy. Once a year, schedule a professional cleaning with your vet. \nEar and eye care: While you’re brushing your pup, it’s a good time to check their eyes and ears. If your dog has any “crusties” around their eyes, use a damp, warm washcloth or a vet-recommended product to clean them. Look at the ears for signs of debris, redness, or swelling (let your vet know if you see anything). Your vet may recommend at-home ear cleaning with an ear cleanser.  \nNail care: Nail trimming is a challenge with this breed—even their nails are XL! Use heavy-duty nail clippers every four to six weeks. If you’re not comfortable with this task, a groomer or your vet can do it. You’ll know it’s time to trim when you hear your Dane’s nails clacking on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Great Danes are undoubtably very bright, but you might also notice a strong-willed streak once you dive into training. That means it’s usually best for a Great Dane to have a pet parent with experience to help them develop into a well-mannered pup.  \n\nGreat Danes tend to pick up basic obedience cues—like sit, stay, down, and come—quickly if you start when they’re puppies. It’s also physically easier to train a Great Dane puppy, so start early. \n\nMake sure to use positive reinforcement—that is, treats, toys, and praise—when you train them; as with all dogs, negative reinforcement can have poor consequences and do a lot more harm than good.  \n\nAnd don’t forget to socialize your dog, too. It’ll help them thrive (and be polite when guests show up), but it’ll also help them get along with other dogs and young kids, especially since they might be several sizes larger than them. Enrolling your Great Dane in puppy school is a great way for them to learn the basics and meet new friends.  \n\nReserve special treats for when you’re out and about, and reward your pup as they interact with new people (at dog-friendly stores, for example). Your Great Dane may or may not end up being a social butterfly, and that’s OK; it just means you’re their favorite (and who could argue with that?).",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best dog food for Great Danes is a high-quality formula designed for large-breed pups. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). You can even find breed-specific dog food just for Great Danes.  \n\nWhen you’re planning your dog’s meals, don’t forget to count the treats—those calories count, too. Your vet can help you make sure you’re balancing your dog’s tastes with their nutritional needs. Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.  \n\nBloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (where the stomach inflates with food and gas, twists, and cuts off blood supply to organs) are extremely dangerous conditions that can affect Great Danes. To reduce the chances of bloat and GDV, take some precautions when feeding your dog: \r\n\n\t• Don’t allow your Great Dane to exercise for an hour before or after eating.  \nPut your dog’s food in a slow feeder bowl, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy.  \nAvoid using raised food bowls.  \nFeed your Dane smaller, frequent meals throughout the day instead of one large breakfast or dinner.",
  "exercise_description": "A Great Dane needs 30–60 minutes of exercise every day. Daily activity can be a mix of neighborhood walks and playtime in a fenced yard.  \n\nAs adults, Great Danes enjoy long hikes, but wait until they’re 2 years old to avoid injury to their growing joints. Some of them might enjoy jogging with you, but again, wait until your Great Dane is fully grown to protect their joints.  \n\nAnother great way to bond with your adult dog is through dog sports. Great Danes are good at agility courses, scent tracking, and even flyball. \n\nDon’t forget to exercise their mind, too: Use interactive toys to engage their brains and help them solve puzzles. \n\nAlthough your Great Dane will enjoy long walks and get an occasional case of the zoomies, their energy level is fairly low. They may have fun on playdates with dog friends or trips to a dog park (both great for mental and physical exercise), but many Danes are also happy to spend the day at home with their favorite person: you.",
  "ideal_environment": "Great Danes don’t necessarily need a Great Big House. They also adapt well to city life and can thrive in an apartment if you’re home most of the day. Just make sure you’ve got ample outdoor access (whether that’s a yard or a nearby park) so they get in their daily exercise. \n\nGreat Danes do best with an experienced pup parent; their massive size and independent streak mean they need a confident leader. They make good family dogs, though, and they’re usually great with kids, especially older ones.  \n\nHowever, the Great Dane is a delightfully placid dog who will probably love all small humans (and vice versa). One common Great Dane trait is to lean affectionately against the people they love; so, you want to supervise them around small children and babies—your pup may knock them over with their love. Also, be mindful of their tail; it packs a powerful swing.",
  "health_description": "The average Great Dane lifespan is 7–10 years. Before bringing home a Great Dane puppy, know that these giant canines do have some common health issues and are somewhat more expensive to take care of simply because of their enormous size (they weigh more than some adults!).  \n\nSome common Great Dane health issues include: \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Great Danes, like many large breeds, are prone to life-threatening bloat and GDV, when the stomach gets distended with air and/or food, twists on itself, and cuts off blood supply to the stomach and spleen. Symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately.  \nDegenerative lumbosacral stenosis: A form of degenerative myelopathy (DM), this spinal condition causes lower back pain that can progress to an inability to stand. Obesity can exacerbate the issue, so it’s important to keep your Great Dane at a healthy weight. \nHeart disease: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), or an enlarged heart, is one of the most common heart diseases in large-breed dogs. It results in thin and weakened heart muscles that can lead to heart failure.  \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a genetic condition that develops in Great Dane puppies when the hip joint doesn’t align well and becomes looser than normal. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, joint supplements, physical therapy, or, in severe cases, surgery. \nWobbler syndrome: Wobbler syndrome is a neurologic condition, especially in dogs with large heads and necks like Great Danes. Also known as cervical spondylomyelopathy, it’s a painful disease of the neck vertebrae that affects the spinal cord and can lead to wobbly walking. It may be linked to nutrition, so be sure to ask your vet about a high-quality, large-breed puppy food and when to transition to adult food.",
  "history_description": "Once upon a time, the Great Dane was a working dog with an important job. The breed descends from ancient Mastiff-type dogs, and even though you might assume the Great Dane came from Denmark, their origins are in Germany. It’s a mystery why the breed’s name refers to a Scandinavian country instead.  \n\nIn the 1800s, the forebears of the Great Dane were used to hunt boar, and they were also guardian dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Great Dane in 1887, and the Great Dane Club of America was established in 1889. \n\nToday, the Great Dane is one of the most popular breeds in the U.S. and has inspired many bright but goofy fictional Great Danes—Scooby-Doo, Marmaduke, and Astro, to name a few.  \n\nGreat Dane puppies tend to cost between $1,000 and $3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Great Dane adoption, as there are many dogs in need of a good home. Reach out to a Great Dane rescue like Team Rocky, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter or rescue org, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
