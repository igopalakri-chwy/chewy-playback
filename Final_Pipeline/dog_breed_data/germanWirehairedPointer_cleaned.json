  "breed_intro": "Headed out on an adventure? The German Wirehaired Pointer would be more than happy to join you. Lithe, speedy and agile (just like you!), these bushy-browed and bearded beauties are ready to live it up with you in the Great Outdoors. An athletic breed known for their hunting skills, GWPs are ATDs—all-terrain doggos. Whether by land or by sea, they're eager to hunt down some fun and share in outdoor activities with their favorite person (that's you of course!).",
  "appearance_description": "It would be easy to mistake the German Wirehaired Pointer dog for your grandpa in dog's clothing—their beards and whiskers bear an uncanny and striking resemblance to your Pop-Pop. But their wiry old hairs serve a purpose: It keeps them safe from thorny (literally) situations when tromping through field and forest. One look into their eyes, if you can see them under their bushy eyebrows (seriously, Grandpa, is that you?), and you can see they hold a million adventures they can't wait to tell you all about.",
  "temperament_description": "Think of the German Wirehaired Pointer as your family's camp counselor: They're here for you whenever you need them and are always willing to listen. But hey, why don't we have this conversation outside? While we hike. Or perhaps while stalking through a field. Or better yet, let's talk while we find some ducks to chase. (OK, your camp counselor probably never suggested that.)\r\n\r\nThe point(er) is, German Wirehaired Pointers love nothing more than to be with their pet parent, especially if you love the Great Outdoors as much as they do. Loyal and loving, they make great family dogs, as long as kids big or little understand and respect the pup's boundaries. They're eager to please, and when they're not engaged in the Very Serious Act of Being Outside Doing All The Things, these pups have a sweet side to their personality that charms everyone they meet.\r\n\r\nThese friendly pups generally get along well with other dogs and cats if they are raised with them. Other small animals would be well advised to steer clear of German Wirehaired Pointers, because Pointers gotta Point, and they'll point right at and retrieve any squirrel, rabbit, duck or other creature in the wild—or your backyard.\r\n\r\nGerman Wirehaired Pointers have that classic working dog trait—if they have a job to do (hunting, tracking, sorting laundry), they are On. It. In addition to the jobs they do at home, these pups also have careers in the professional world. With their strong nose skills, they make excellent drug detection dogs and have even found success as therapy dogs, bonding closely to their person. Without a job, they may figure out something else to do to pass the time, and you may not like what they choose. They are highly intelligent and need to keep their brains as active as their bodies.",
  "care_description": "A German Wirehaired Pointer is loving and loyal but definitely not lazy. While pretty low-maintenance when it comes to their grooming needs, this hunting breed makes up for it with their massive amounts of energy that requires daily, vigorous exercise to burn off. They're active and intelligent, so keeping their bodies and their brains engaged is essential to their—and your—happiness!",
  "grooming_description": "A German Wirehaired Pointer's grooming needs are fairly low compared to other breeds. They rate low on the shedding scale, too. Here are grooming tips for your German Wirehaired Pointer:\n\n \t• Brushing: Their standout feature is their unique wiry outer coat which is not only fashionable, but also functional. It acts as a water-repellent cover for these field- and forest-loving dogs. While it's a low-maintenance coat, all that foraging does mean your dog will come home with various bits and bobs stuck to their fur. A brush once a week with a slicker brush followed by a pet comb will keep the forest, fields and whatever else out of your dog's hair—and out of your house.\nEar cleaning: Their ears should also be checked regularly for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \nNail trimming: If you can hear your German Wirehaired Pointer tap-dancing their way to you before you can see them, it's time for a nail trim (typically once every two to four weeks).\nDental care: Let's not forget the teeth! Brush your German Wirehaired Pointer's teeth daily; start when they're a puppy with twice-a-week toothbrushings to get them used to the feeling. Once a year, have your vet professionally clean your dog's teeth to ensure their grin is as goofy and endearing as ever.",
  "training_description": "One of the standout qualities of a German Wirehaired Pointer is their intelligence, making them a pleasure to train. Start training them early to ensure they grow up to be well-socialized and well-versed in manners with both people and other dogs.\n\nAs a duck hunting breed, these types have already got that inkling to retrieve, but regular training classes will help them excel at being responsive and coming when you call. Training them to keep their prey drive in check is also necessary. You don't want them tracking and chasing every squirrel you meet in a five-mile radius. While you can help curb these innate tendencies, it's important to understand that you'll never completely train them out of your dog. With proper training and lots of exercise, though, you can help your dog be a respectful member of society.\n\nTo bring out the best in your German Wirehaired Pointer puppy, use lots of positive reinforcement during your training times. Toys, treats and praise are great ways to reward your pup. These dogs love to be challenged and rewarded by their pet parents.\n\nAnd don't forget socialization. Start socializing your pointer while they're a puppy to help get them used to meeting new people and other dogs. Take your German Wirehaired Pointer puppy on leashed walks and let them safely meet new people and other dogs. Enroll in puppy preschool, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all under one roof.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Your German Wirehaired Pointer will do well on high-quality, commercially prepared packaged dog foods. Make sure to choose a formula designed for your pup's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). These dogs are known for their high energy and may need a higher calorie or protein intake than other breeds. If you're not sure how often or how much to feed your pup, chat with your vet. They can help you determine a mealtime schedule based on your dog's unique needs and lifestyle.\n\nAnd don't forget the dog treats! Everyone loves a little extra something every once in a while, but remember those count toward caloric intake and mealtime goals. Your vet can help you find the right balance between snacks and meals to keep your dog at a healthy weight.",
  "exercise_description": "If there is one thing German Wirehaired Pointers need more than you, it's, hands down, exercise. They need at least an hour, if not more, of vigorous exercise every day. When these pups aren't properly exercised, unwanted behaviors start to emerge—all that energy has to go somewhere, after all. So, why not destroy your shoes or yell incessantly at that leaf that just blew by? They're working dogs, and they need a job to do. Exercise that stimulates them in both body and mind will scratch their itch for work. It isn't a some-days thing—it's an everyday thing.\n\nThe German Wirehaired Pointer dog would love it if everything was an exercise in hunting. So, take your pup out in a fenced yard and play fetch or create scent trails around the yard that lead to fun toys or delicious treats to track down. And—fun fact alert!—German Wirehaired Pointers have webbed feet, even more awesome, making them good swimmers—another outlet to exhaust their energy.\n\nTake them out on long walks—always on a leash, of course. Dogs with high prey drives get very focused when they find something they think needs chasing. And they're quick. So, your pup will be off before you realize it, and they won't hear you call, nor will they look both ways before crossing a street. So, for their safety and your sanity, keep them on a leash when you're not in enclosed spaces.\n\nIf you're into some friendly competition, you and your pup should check out dog sports, like agility, rally (similar to obedience), tracking or flyball. Not only will you be coming home with some fancy winning ribbons, but it's a great way for you two to spend time together—your pointer's favorite pastime.",
  "ideal_environment": "While you don't need to own an entire forest to have a German Wirehaired Pointer (though bonus points if you do), these dogs thrive in the outdoors and need a fenced backyard to run around in.\r\n\r\nThey are very affectionate and are ideally suited for active and experienced pet parents who would love to have a companion for any and all outdoor activities. Their high-energy needs paired with their training makes them a great choice for someone who's had a dog before.\r\n\r\nWhile they can be wary of and a little aloof with strangers, these dogs are very family-oriented and bond strongly with their people, including kids. They'll get along well with other dogs in the home, too. If raised with cats, German Wirehaired Pointers can be fond of and bond with felines as well.",
  "health_description": "The German Wirehaired Pointer breed has a lifespan of 14-16 years, but they can be prone to some health problems. Knowing about them in advance can help keep your pup healthy for longer. \r\n\n \t• Bloat: Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV), commonly known as bloat, is a condition where a dog’s stomach will twist on itself and fill with gas, cutting off blood supply to the stomach. This is an absolute emergency and typically requires emergency surgery. \r\n \t• Elbow Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition when the bones of the elbow joint don’t fit properly. It can cause pain and difficulty walking and often leads to arthritis. X-rays are needed to confirm the diagnosis, and surgery is often recommended. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: When the ball and socket of a dog’s hip doesn’t develop and align properly, the bones will grind against each other, limiting your dog’s ability to run, jump, climb stairs and more. Keeping them at a healthy weight and restricting physical exercise can help, but if the case is severe, your dog may need surgery. \r\n \t• Von Willebrand Disease: This is a bleeding disorder caused by a protein deficiency (von Willebrand factor) that helps platelets stick together and form clots. While most dogs with the disease never show symptoms, some dogs may get a spontaneous nosebleed or have prolonged bleeding after injury or surgery. Sometimes blood transfusions are needed. \r\n \t• Aortic Stenosis: Aortic stenosis is an inherited heart condition wherein your pup has a partial blood flow obstruction, making their heart work harder to pump blood. This is most often caught during a routine wellness exam as a heart murmur. If a murmur is detected, your veterinarian will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause of the murmur.   \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: This is a deficiency of thyroid hormone. Signs of this condition can include dry skin and coat, hair loss, susceptibility to other skin diseases, weight gain and lethargy. Your vet can conduct a blood screening test annually to screen for it. Treatment is typically daily medication.",
  "history_description": "A close relative of the German Shorthaired Pointer, the German Wirehaired Pointer's origin story starts in, you guessed it, Germany, where they were bred to be versatile hunting dogs. Other dogs in the German Wirehaired Pointer's genealogy are believed to include the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and Polish water dogs.\r\n\r\nAt first, these dogs were bred simply to keep up with the demand for hunting dogs, but eventually, it transformed into needing a bird dog who could do it all—run through brush, swim through water, stalk through tall grass and more. And because of that, the German Wirehaired Pointer needed a standout feature. Enter their low-maintenance, wiry coat that protects them against the brush and the elements.\r\n\r\nThe breed crossed the pond to the United States in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the German Wirehaired Pointer in 1959 as its 113th breed.\r\n\r\nThinking about adding a German Wirehaired Pointer to your family? You can find reputable breeders on the AKC's website, where the average German Wirehaired Pointer costs $800-$1,200. For that price, you'll likely get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to German Wirehaired Pointer rescue organizations or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter to adopt a pup. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
