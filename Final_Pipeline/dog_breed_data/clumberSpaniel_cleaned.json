  "breed_intro": "Calm. Mellow. Laid-back. No matter which word you use to mean “totally chill,\" the Clumber Spaniel has it in spades. Clumbers don't really get overly excited about much—except maybe an interesting scent that needs to be tracked down. Their happy place is wherever you are. (Who knew large white shadows were a thing?) Sure, they shed a lot (and drool a little), but in exchange for accessorizing your outfits with dog hair, you get a “ride or die\" bestie who wants to spend all their time by your side.",
  "appearance_description": "These low-riders have big bodies on short legs with thick white coats that look—and feel—like soft cotton. Clumber Spaniel dogs, with their powerful hindquarters, deep chests and large feet, were bred for hunting and, true to their sporting histories, are still apt to have their noses to the ground in pursuit of a scent while their feathered tails wag at top speed.",
  "temperament_description": "The Clumber Spaniel's amiable temperament is one of their best qualities. Want to take a walk? Grab the leash. Prefer to curl up with a book? Make room on the couch. Friends coming over? Watch these pups turn on the charm, turning even those self-described “not dog people\" into Clumber Spaniel converts.\n\nThis breed is most at home with adults and dogs, but these dogs can be agreeable companions in almost any living situation. Clumber Spaniels with kids? Check. Raising a Clumber Spaniel with cats? Should be just fine. The breed is not known for aggression or biting tendencies and, with proper introductions and respectful playmates, they are easy-going enough to adapt to life both with two- and four-legged family members. (Just be sure to watch these dogs around small kids; the pup may accidentally knock tiny tots over.)\n\nThe breed has an almost unflappable personality, but these dogs are smart and can be willful, which means training is a must, and it's got to be interesting and varied to keep them from getting bored. Start training your Clumber Spaniel as a puppy and continue reinforcing the training—and adding new skills—throughout their lives.",
  "care_description": "Clumber Spaniel dogs need a moderate amount of care to keep them healthy and happy. While they tend to be mellow, happy-go-lucky dogs who can adapt to many different environments, providing some exercise and a lot of mental stimulation mixed with ample quality time, lots of grooming and regular training will help these gentle pups thrive.",
  "grooming_description": "Clumber Spaniels might have long locks, but that doesn't mean you'll spend a ton of time taming their tresses. In fact, their coats don't require professional grooming, and a thorough brushing one to two times a week with a pin brush followed by a dog comb is all it takes to remove excess hair and prevent matting.\n\nHowever, Clumber Spaniels are big shedders, so don't be surprised to see white clouds of hair blowing around the house. Maintaining an at-home grooming routine can help remove excess hair from their weather-resistant coats, and, while it won't prevent them from shedding altogether, it can keep it to a minimum.\n\nIf your Clumber is more apt to hunt for a cozy spot to nap than tag along on an actual hunting trip, bathing them once a month is sufficient to keep their coats clean. This is the perfect time to trim their nails; the bath water makes their nails soft and easier to cut. You'll know their nails are ready for a trim when you hear that familiar clacking sound on hard surfaces.\n\nBetween baths, you'll need to tackle a few special grooming tasks to keep the breed looking and feeling their best. Wash their faces with a damp washcloth, cleaning out dirt that collects between the thick folds on their heads. If you skip the wipe-downs, you'll risk stinky yeast infections. Ditto for their ears: Check them regularly for debris, redness and swelling, and contact your vet if you see anything unusual. They may recommend at-home ear cleaning.\n\nLike all breeds, Clumber Spaniel 101 also includes routine dental care that includes dental chews or rinses, daily at-home toothbrushing and annual professional cleanings by your veterinarian. Your vet can provide some guidance on brushing their teeth, starting when your Clumber Spaniel is a puppy to help establish the routine and make it a lifelong habit.",
  "training_description": "You know those children who whine “why?\" when they're asked to put on their shoes or power down their screens? Clumber Spaniels take a similar approach to training. Originally bred to be hunting dogs who flushed birds from brush, Clumbers are intelligent and have a mind of their own. If training sessions are too long or too boring, they will find other ways to entertain themselves.\n\nKeep their training sessions short and fun to avoid boredom, about 10 minutes each time. Incorporate a combination of physical and mental stimulation for an added challenge. Clumbers belong to the American Kennel Club's Sporting group, which includes dogs who were specifically bred to hunt and retrieve. As hunters, the Clumber Spaniel breed excels at scent work, so engage them in training games to take advantage of their desire to follow their noses. Just remember not to let them off-leash without a secure fence, or else following a scent could get them lost. And be sure to provide lots of positive reinforcement in the form of praise and treats for a job well done.\n\nLet's not forget socialization! Giving your Clumber Spaniel puppy many opportunities to experience new things (people, other dogs and environments) helps them be more at ease with new experiences as they grow up. Take them on walks so they can see new people and other dogs. Also consider enrolling them in puppy school; this is a great place for them to learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people in the process.",
  "diet_nutrition": "It takes a lot of dog food for Clumber Spaniels to maintain their massive frames. They typically do well on high-quality commercial dog foods that provide a complete and balanced diet to meet their calorie and nutrient needs. Choose a food based on their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and that meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. Work with your veterinarian to create a feeding chart to ensure you're providing the right type and amount of food for your pup.\n\nClumbers aren't a super-active breed, and marathon afternoon naps aren't enough to burn off the calories from overeating, so keep portions in check to prevent weight gain. Being overweight puts Clumber Spaniels at risk for a number of health issues, including arthritis. In addition to monitoring their portions, steer clear of table scraps and keep dog treats to a minimum. Again, your vet can recommend the right food and amounts to keep your pup at their ideal weight.",
  "exercise_description": "Clumber Spaniels were bred to hunt and retrieve, so bring on fast-paced games of fetch, but expect these scent dogs to take lots of breaks to sniff around the yard and nap in the sunshine. Your Clumber will happily tag along for hikes, play with other dogs at the dog park or engage in games of tag with children, but they do not require nonstop activity to thrive. They really only need about 30 minutes a day.\n\nThese pups were bred as bird dogs and, with a little training, will become excellent hunting partners—even if you're only hunting out a great spot for a short hike.\n\nWhile Clumber Spaniels enjoy some time sniffing around the backyard, these dogs are happiest spending time with their families, so prioritize exercises that involves time together and play on their retrieving skills like games of fetch or even dog sports like agility, tracking or conformation (dog shows).\n\nLeash walks are great, especially when you take the long route, but their speed is slow, so expect a lumbering pace and prepare for your Clumber to sniff everything in their path. Think twice before allowing off-leash play in areas without a secure fence, as these hunting dogs love to follow their noses.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Clumber Spaniel is the epitome of adaptability. The breed can be a copilot for RV life, exploring new trails and meeting new friends from coast to coast, or they could settle into a hectic family schedule complete with morning walks, afternoon carpools and lots of Little League games.\n\nThey are big dogs, so they do love large yards to run around in, but as long as you can meet their exercise needs and they have the space to crash, smaller abodes, like apartments, can do just fine.\n\nWhat the Clumber Spaniel needs most is someone to love. They want to be your fluffy, four-legged BFF, taking long walks on the beach and curling up for movie nights. They are equal opportunity companions, happy to bestow their affection on almost everyone they meet.",
  "health_description": "Clumber Spaniels have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years, but they are prone to a lot of health issues. This shouldn’t stop you from bringing one of these lovable pups into your home. With the knowledge of these issues, you can help your pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\n\t• Eye Issues: The same expressive eyes that make Clumber Spaniels so adorable can also be the source of pain and discomfort. The breed is prone to entropion, a condition that causes the eyelid to roll inward. When the hair on the lids rubs against the cornea, it can lead to pain and cause corneal ulcers. Entropion can be corrected with surgery. Clumbers can also get ectropion, which is the opposite issue: It causes the lower eyelid to roll out, exposing the tissues that line the eyelids, leading to dry eye and discomfort. The treatments range from lubricating eye drops and antibiotics to surgery to correct the condition.\nHip Dysplasia: Large breeds like the Clumber Spaniel are prone to hip dysplasia. This occurs when the ball and socket joint of the hip does not form properly resulting in lameness, pain and arthritis. Depending on the severity of the condition, your vet may recommend physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or surgery.\nIntervertebral Disc Disease: Thanks to their long backs, Clumber Spaniels are at increased risk for IVDD. The degenerative spinal condition causes the intervertebral disc (or the material that helps cushion the spaces between the discs) to harden, causing pain, impaired movement and, in severe cases, paralysis. Treatment can range from medications and strict rest to emergency surgery based on the severity.\nPanosteitis: Clumbers are prone to growing quickly in their long bones, which can result in growing pains or panosteitis. This can be quite painful and result in lameness in one or multiple legs. Luckily it is self-limiting and will resolve on its own. Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory medications relieve pain and reduce inflammation, as well as restricting your dog's activity, may help to relieve your dog’s pain until it goes away.\nImmune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA): IMHA is a condition in which the body attacks its own red blood cells, resulting in anemia. This may have a genetic component but there is no genetic screening test available. Diagnosis is based on blood tests and treatment often includes steroids, immunosuppressants and blood transfusions.",
  "history_description": "The exact lineage of the Clumber Spaniel is unknown. The breed may have originated in France and later smuggled into England during the French Revolution. Or, they may be the result of crossing Basset Hounds with Alpine Spaniels.\n\nOne thing about their history is certain: The breed, named for Clumber Park, the British estate where the Duke of Newcastle helped develop the big-boned spaniel breed, dates back at least as far as the 1700s.\n\nBoth King Edward VII and King George V had Clumber Spaniels (King George even bred the dogs, helping raise the profile of the breed), as did Queen Victoria in the 19th century. In fact, the breeding of Clumber Spaniels was once limited to royal estates, and only nobility kept these dogs.\n\nClumber were bred to hunt, working alongside hunters to flush out game birds. Their thick, white coats made them easier to spot in the brush (and their dignified demeanors and skill at the sport earned them a spot in several notable paintings prized by British aristocrats).\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the British-born breed made its way overseas, quickly capturing hearts in Canada and the United States. The Clumber Spaniel was one of the nine charter breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club when it was founded in 1884.\n\nAlthough the Clumber Spaniel has a long and storied history, it's one of the lesser-known spaniel breeds. You can find reputable breeders selling Clumber Spaniel puppies through the AKC Marketplace, and spaniel rescues might also have Clumbers available for adoption. Search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area. Clumber Spaniel puppies cost around $800 to $1,200. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.",
