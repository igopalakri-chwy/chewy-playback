  "breed_intro": "Rottweilers have an impressive legacy—they worked with the Roman legions in ancient times, and they were counted on to be guardians and helpers. They’re strong, smart, and always ready for dinner (don’t fall for it when they bat their eyes for a second helping, though).  \n\nLike a complex TV detective who seems tough at first glance, Rottweilers also have a sensitive side, with a big heart and an even greater need to have a special person to help curtail any separation anxiety. These high-energy pups benefit from a pet parent with the time to train them, and they’re usually a great fit for a family, too.",
  "appearance_description": "With a stocky build and dark, almond-shaped eyes, the Rottweiler is a medium-large dog with triangular ears that hang naturally next to their cheeks. \n\nAll Rottweilers have a black coat with rust to mahogany accents. Their splotches of color have clearly defined borders and are most notable on their expressive eyebrows.",
  "temperament_description": "Rottweilers are bright pups who can benefit from early training and socialization. They’re easy to train and eager to please—and sometimes so easygoing that they may seem aloof to the outside world.  \n\nOriginally descending from the Mastiffs of the Roman legions, Rottweilers have been valuable companions and working dogs for centuries. They’re just as loyal today as they’ve always been, and pet parents who dedicate the time to training and socializing their new bestie will be rewarded with a lifelong friendship.  \n\nBut the Rottweiler temperament can be a bit needier than most people realize. Their big statue gives them a tough cop persona, but at heart, they’re obsessed with their person and just want to be with them as much as possible. Isolation has a particularly negative affect on these pups, and it can lead to unhealthy behaviors.    \n\nBecause Rottweilers are so strong, it’s important to train and socialize them. It’ll help them thrive (and be polite when guests show up), but it’ll also help them get along with other dogs and young kids, especially since your pup might be several sizes larger than their new friends. (A male Rottie can weigh 130 pounds or more!)  \n\nMake sure to use positive reinforcement—that is, treats, toys, and praise—when you train them; as with all dogs, negative reinforcement can do a lot more harm than good.  \n\nOne adorable Rottie feature is the way they vocalize. They’re not known for excessive barking (though they will bark now and then), but they do have a deep rumble that sounds almost like a growl, yet it’s not—you can think of it like a cat’s purr. You might hear it when your Rottweiler is particularly content, like during a belly rub.",
  "care_description": "Rotties may be easy to groom, but that doesn’t mean you can slack off on care. They need daily exercise, tons of attention, and regular brushing and training. Just like a little kid looking for direction, they also need structure and interaction.",
  "grooming_description": "Here are some tips to keep your Rottie looking sharp: \r\n\n\t• Brush your dog with a stiff bristle brush every few days to keep their coat shiny and reduce shedding, especially in the spring and fall, when they shed the most. \nBathe them weekly with a dog shampoo for sensitive skin. Rottweiler coats can dry out from allergies, so a shampoo for itchy, dry skin may be in order. \nAsk your vet if they need an omega-3 DHA supplement to keep their coat shiny. \nBrush your Rottie’s teeth every day with dog toothpaste. Get a pro cleaning once a year.  \nCheck ears for debris, swelling, or redness, which could be signs of ear infections. Your vet may suggest cleaning their ears at home.  \nClip your Rottweiler’s nails every two weeks or as soon as you hear them clicking on hard surfaces. You can do it at home, but your groomer or vet can do it, too. Start when they’re a puppy so they get used to it.",
  "training_description": "One of the best Rottweilers traits (out of many!) is that they’re very smart dogs who learn quickly. Start your dog’s education as early as you can; you can even enlist a certified dog trainer who uses positive reinforcement to help them shine. Rewarding your dog with treats for good behavior is a great way to shape their manners (just don’t overdo it on the goodies).  \n\nA dog trainer will help you learn how to communicate with your dog and teach them the basics—such as sit, stay, and how to walk on a leash. They’ll also advise you on proper socialization to ensure your dog grows into a well-adjusted pup who remains calm, cool, and collected.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Known for their hearty appetite (who can blame them?), Rotties typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nYou may want to consider sticking with a formula specifically for large-breed dogs. Some trusted brands, like Royal Canin, also make dog food specifically for Rottweiler puppies and adults.  \n\nRottweilers love food, so you’ll need to keep an extra eye on them at the dinner table—they’re not above stealing a scrap or two. They often inhale their meals with a gusto that makes it look like they’ve never tasted kibble before, so they’d do well to slow down.  \n\nYou can buy a slow feeder dog bowl or a food-dispensing toy that engages their brain in an activity while they eat. These tools can also help prevent stomach bloat, a serious condition that’s not uncommon in deep-chested breeds like Rottweilers.",
  "exercise_description": "Rotties need a lot of activity—at least one to three hours a day. Simply letting them out in the backyard is not enough stimulation, so if you’re more of a homebody who’d rather spend all weekend with a book or movie, these gentle giants might not be your soul animal.  \n\nRottweilers were historically working dogs, so they love having a skill to focus on. Like a little kid who craves guidance, Rotties love it when you give them a goal or challenge. Here are a few good options: \r\n\n\t• Teach them a trick in the backyard. \nOn a walk, change your route and practice cues like “sit” and “wait” to keep them engaged. \nPlay fetch. (This ball launcher will give them a good workout.) \nConsider more novel adventures, like hiking.   \nIf your pup is well-socialized, take them regularly to the neighborhood dog park. \r\n\nExercise will regulate their energy levels and make them less likely to have anxiety or engage in nervous behaviors, like chewing your favorite shoe (there are toys to help with that too!).",
  "ideal_environment": "A Rottweiler’s ideal home is in the suburbs or countryside with a big backyard. These are big, active dogs, and they need lots of space to burn off all that energy. (Remember, you still have to engage them mentally and physically—the space alone can’t do that.) \n\nThat’s not to say they couldn’t thrive in an urban setting. Rottweiler dogs might do well in a city if you are willing to put in the time and effort (it would be ideal if your apartment was adjacent to a park where you could go many times a day).  \n\nIf you rent, keep in mind that Rottweilers are unfortunately a misunderstood breed, and there are some landlords who might not allow one. Hopefully as more people understand how loving these pups are, those policies will begin to change.",
  "health_description": "As a large breed, the average Rottweiler lifespan is 9–10 years. Here are a few potential health issues for pet parents to be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Rottweilers, like many large breeds, are prone to a life-threatening condition called bloat that occurs when the stomach fills with air or food. A serious complication of bloat is when the stomach twists on itself, cutting off blood supply to the organs. This is called GDV, and symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately. \nCancer: Rottweilers are prone to two types: Bone cancer, or osteosarcoma, shows up as leg pain and lameness. It can often be treated with surgery, but chemo and other meds may be needed. Lymphoma often manifests as a firm bump in a lymph node (the back of the hind legs, under the jaw, or the armpits are most common), and it’s often treatable with chemotherapy. \nEye issues: Rottweilers are prone to several eye conditions. Progressive retinal atrophy leads to blindness in dogs, and while there is no cure, genetic testing is available. Entropion, when one the eyelid rolls inward, can often be corrected with surgery. \nHip and elbow dysplasia: Common in large breeds, dysplasia is where the joints don’t fit together properly, whether it’s the hip or elbow. Treatment may include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, or surgery. \nHypertrophic osteodystrophy: Also known as HOD, this orthopedic developmental disorder occurs in giant dog breeds who develop too quickly. The outer part of the bone grows too fast when they’re puppies, often causing intense pain. \nSubaortic stenosis: This congenital heart condition is a narrowing of the aortic valve. Weakness, trouble breathing, and collapse are all symptoms. If your vet hears a heart murmur, your pup will likely need an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).",
  "history_description": "Once upon a time, the Roman Army needed bright working dogs to be guardians of the herds they relied on for food. So, they bred them from Mastiffs.   \n\nThe Romans brought these loyal companions with them as they conquered the known world, eventually leaving them in the town of Rottweil, Germany, to protect cow herds after the collapse of the Roman Empire. These early Rottweilers became the main stock used for many German breeds over the next few hundred years. \n\nAfter the rise of cattle cars in the 1800s, Rotties found work as police and service dogs. The Rottweiler’s size, quick wits, and training know-how made them excellent at a range of complex jobs—from search and rescue operations to serving as guide dogs for people with disabilities. Since World War I, Rottweilers have served in various military branches, both as guardians and skilled working dogs. \n\nRottweilers first appeared in the U.S. in the 1920s, and, in 1931, the first Rottweiler (named Stina von Felsenmeer) was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC). By the mid-1990s, more than 100,000 Rottweilers had been registered, and the Rottie is now one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. \n\nIf you’re looking to bring home a Rottweiler puppy, expect to pay at least $1,500 and work with a reputable breeder. You can also find Rottweilers for adoption by searching Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs, as well as Rottweiler rescues like Kodi’s Club and Rottweiler Rescue of Los Angeles.",
