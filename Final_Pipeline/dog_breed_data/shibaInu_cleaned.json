  "breed_intro": "The Shiba Inu looks like a fox, acts like a cat, and has a scream that could get them cast in a horror movie. This quirky Japanese breed is an affectionate bestie with their favorite people but might give strangers the side eye.   \n\nWith a mind of their own, they’re more likely to go along with the show if they think it was their idea in the first place—so train them early. Shibas are faithful companions, and they’re glad they had the brilliant idea to let you be their friend (consider it an honor).",
  "appearance_description": "The Shiba Inu is a compact but highly athletic dog with an alert expression, especially when they’re excited or playing (unless they’re giving you the side eye). Whatever they’re doing, they always seem to have a smile on their face. These pups resemble a fox’s bigger cousin with their distinctive red coat (though Shiba Inu colors include black, tan, and sesame, too!), bushy tail, and fuzzy, pointy ears.",
  "temperament_description": "Shiba Inu dogs have strong, confident personalities and exhibit a mellow friendliness around their friends and family. But when it comes to strangers, they may suddenly seem aloof—cue the cat-like indifference.  \n\nThese good-natured pups have an independent streak, so it’s best to keep them on a leash—there are too many fascinating sights and sounds in the world to catch their attention. Shiba Inu can be a bit selfish when it comes to sharing their things (relatable), so make sure they learn good manners early on. Socialization and training are a must with the breed, and you should start when your Shiba puppy is young.  \n\nWhen Shibas are feeling grumpy (maybe they’re not happy you denied them that third treat), they’ll let you know about their displeasure—loudly. But Shina Inu don’t bark. They have a unique vocalization, affectionately called the “Shiba Inu scream.”  \n\nUsed more often than a true bark, it’s a high-pitched whine, kind of like the noise a cat makes crossed with the sound of a human baby crying. This is all the more reason to socialize and train your Shiba Inu early—training will help minimize any temper tantrums.",
  "care_description": "Shiba Inu need dedicated training time, but they are not high-energy pups who need a ton of exercise, nor do they have a lot of health problems. Their grooming needs are low, too, even though they shed. Their fur does need extra care during the fall and spring when they experience heavy shedding.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Don’t overdo it on the bubble baths. Shibas are excellent at self-grooming (they really do have lots in common with cats), so they really only need a bath one or two times a year. Of course, if they happen to get super dirty, you should bathe your dog so they’re not stinky. \nBrushing: Shibas have a double coat with a layer of thicker hair over the softer inner coat. As a result, Shiba Inu shed quite considerably twice a year—once in the spring and again in the fall. When your pet isn’t shedding, you can brush them once a week with a slicker brush. But during the heavy shedding season, brush your Shiba Inu twice a week with a rake brush. Shibas can handle cold weather, but they aren’t as well adapted to heat, so removing loose hair when they’re shedding can keep them from overheating in the summer months.  \nDental care: Brush their teeth daily. Start when your Shiba Inu’s a puppy to help get them used to it. Get a professional dental cleaning once a year. \nNail care: Your Shiba Inu’s nails should be clipped about once a month. You’ll know it’s time when you hear them tapping on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Undeniably adorable and lovely companions, Shiba Inu aren’t the easiest breed to train or socialize. It’s best to tackle this job early on, but it may still take a certified dog trainer to bring out your pup’s full potential. The Shiba’s temperament is complex, and they need a confident, experienced pup parent to lead the way. \n\nFind something that motivates your Shiba Inu puppy—like a favorite treat or toy—and use that as positive reinforcement. Shiba Inu, while very intelligent, are strong-willed, independent, and aloof (shoutout to cat tendencies again). Put simply, they participate only if they want to and might need some extra encouragement.  \n\nIn addition to teaching basic cues like sit, stay, and come, help your Shiba get used to interactions when young. This will help them manage with veterinarians (or the occasional groomer)—and minimize any Shiba screams or reactive behavior. Basic puppy training can start as early as 8 weeks old, and socialization can begin anywhere from 3–12 weeks old.  \n\nEarly socialization will also help your Shiba Inu puppy have a healthy relationship with other creatures, human or animal. They may be wary of strangers, so let them see people and animals at a distance before allowing them to approach.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Shiba Inu do well on a high-quality dog food that meets AAFCO standards. Choose a formula that fits their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Dry or wet dog food is fine; see what your dog’s preference is.  \n\nGenerally, Shibas don’t have special food or diet needs, and your vet can help you pick the best choice. \n\nOf course, don’t forget the treats. Look for healthy bites like Zuke’s Mini Naturals training treats. Healthy dog-safe human foods, like pieces of carrots or bananas, make great snacks, too. Whichever treat you choose, include these in your overall mealtime plan; treats count as calories, too, and should not be more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "The Shiba Inu breed is an athletic dog with average energy levels, but this doesn’t mean they’re couch potatoes. They need about an hour or more of exercise a day, whether it’s a fun game in a fenced-in yard or a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. \n\nSome Shibas love dog sports, like agility courses, flyball, and even competitive search and rescue. As long as your Shiba feels like it’s fun and their idea, they’re bound to enjoy it. Just be sure to leash up if you’re not in a fenced-in area, because Shibas are prone to going off on their own adventures—even when it’s not in their best interests.  \n\nWhen fitting them for a collar, a Shiba Inu’s neck size is about 14–17 inches. However, collars might be best for an ID tag only, while a dog harness may offer more support for walks.",
  "ideal_environment": "House in the suburbs? A Shiba Inu will happily live there. Cabin in the country? No problem! Condo or apartment? This dog loves the minimalist lifestyle, too. \n\nWhile they’re not picky with their indoor space, outdoors is another story. These clever escape artists shouldn’t go off-leash—their bold, daring nature and urge to chase anything that moves means they’re likely to run away at the slightest provocation, without realizing the dangers involved.  \n\nShibas need a secure, fenced-in yard to enjoy off-leash play, since they can’t always be trusted to come back when you call. If you don’t have a fenced-in area, take lots of leashed walks. If you’re a jogging or cycling pet parent, your Shiba Inu might enjoy joining you.  \n\nShiba Inu are a great family dog if you socialize them early and kids are taught how to respectfully interact with them. Like a kindergartener who’s still learning to share, Shiba Inu may not like it if children or other dogs try to play with their toys, so keep this in mind.  \n\nDespite having so much in common, Shiba Inu and cats may not be the best fit, as a cat may trigger a Shiba Inu’s natural desire to chase. However, if they were raised together since they were babies, they might do well. \n\nThanks to their double coat, Shiba Inu are well adapted to cold climates. However, they don’t thrive in very hot weather; protect them from overheating, and limit exercise and training to the cooler parts of the day.",
  "health_description": "The Shiba Inu lifespan is 13–16 years, and they generally don’t have many health issues. Here are a few to be aware of. \r\n\n\t• Allergies: Common in Shiba Inu, signs of allergies in dogs include itchiness on the skin, feet, or ears. These can be caused by food or pollen, dust, and other things in the environment. Topical remedies, such as medicated shampoo, dietary changes, and medication, may help.  \nGlaucoma: Glaucoma is a serious and painful eye problem that can cause blindness in dogs. Fortunately, your vet can perform a test to help detect the change in eye pressure that accompanies this disease. If caught early, glaucoma can be treated, but a dog who loses their eyesight can still live a happy, full life. \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia, which occurs when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones don’t properly fit, is an inherited condition that can be made worse if a pup is overweight. It eventually leads to arthritis and pain. More severe cases may require surgery, but the condition is often treated with medications, joint supplements, special diets, weight management, and/or physical therapy. \nLuxating patella: A luxating patella is when the kneecap slips in and out of its normal position. This uncomfortable condition can cause gait changes and cause arthritis. In severe cases, surgery may be needed.",
  "history_description": "The Shiba Inu is an ancient breed with origins in Japan. For centuries, Shiba Inu were hunting dogs who were skilled at capturing birds and game. Three types of Shiba Inu developed in different regions of Japan: \r\n\r\n\t• Mino: This Shiba Inu hails from the center of Japan and is a deep mahogany color without urajiro. \nSan’in: This pup is larger, most often black, and comes from the northeastern region of Japan. \nShinshu: These dogs also hail from central Japan and have rounder eyes and a sickle-shaped tail, instead of the curled tail that modern Shibas sport today.  \r\n\r\nIn the mid-20th century, the Shiba Inu population declined significantly due to World War II and a subsequent outbreak of canine distemper in Japan. Thankfully, enough Shibas survived to preserve the breed, and the surviving dogs were predominantly the Shinshu type. \n\nThe first Shiba Inu was brought to the United States in the 1950s, and the first litter of Shiba Inu puppies in the U.S. was recorded in the late 1970s. The National Shiba Club of America was established in 1992. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in the same year, and the rest is history. \n\nToday, Shibas remain hugely popular in Japan (they’re the No. 1 companion dog there), and they’ve won plenty of hearts in the States, too. If you’re looking to add a Shiba as a pet, the average price for a Shiba Inu puppy is anywhere from $1,000 to $3,500. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Shiba Inu adoption. Reach out to Shiba Inu rescue organizations to adopt (like the Colorado Shiba Inu Rescue). You can also keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter or rescue, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "What does Shiba Inu mean?",
      "answer": "In Japanese, the word “inu” means dog—that part’s easy. It’s trickier to understand how the word “Shiba” fits in.  \n\n“Shiba” translates to the word brushwood, so Shiba Inu literally means “brushwood dog.” Brushwood leaves turn red in the fall, so it’s possible the name is in reference to the Shiba Inu’s often red coat. But no one is 100% sure where it came from."
