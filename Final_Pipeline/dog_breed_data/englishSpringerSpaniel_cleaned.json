  "breed_intro": "English Springer Spaniels are gorgeous dogs who were born to be active from sun up to sun down. These fun-loving pups have energy to spare and will love every outdoor adventure you can throw their way. Hiking? Yes! Jogging? OMG, let's go! Climbing Mt. Rainer? Um... You do know they don't have opposable thumbs, right? Springers enjoy nothing more than hanging out with you, even if you're just gardening or grilling. (The FOMO is real, folks). Happy to entertain kids of all ages with games of hide-and-go-seek or fetch, this dog is the sidekick you've been looking for.",
  "appearance_description": "The English Springer Spaniel breed is a medium sporting dog with a compact body and athletic build. (Sporting dogs were bred to work with hunters.) They have a moderately long coat with feathering on their long, flappy ears, chest and hindquarters; and their tail (either docked or left long) wags merrily to greet you.",
  "temperament_description": "The English Springer Spaniel's temperament is high-spirited and gregarious. They are very driven dogs. Bred to be out in the fields hunting with people, their philosophy is \"the more, the merrier.\" Springers love to please their people, which makes them very trainable.\n\nBecause they love their people so much, they need a home where someone will be with them for most of the day. (The separation anxiety is real.) If you're not able to be with them, check them into doggy daycare or arrange for a neighbor or pet sitter to come by for playtime.\n\nSpeaking of playtime, Springer Spaniel dogs are very playful, making them great with older kids as long as they are properly socialized from an early age and the kids are taught how to properly interact with dogs. These pups are very active and may knock over toddlers and babies during play (so be sure to supervise play times!). Their super-friendly nature extends to other dogs, but not to cats. (They were bred to hunt and will give chase. )\n\nThese dogs are very intelligent and have an independent streak, so training needs to start early and be consistent. Their intelligence and independence make them better suited to someone who has experience with dogs, but they can be good for a new pup parent who is willing to commit to the necessary training. (Say goodbye to Saturdays off!)\n\nThese pups have a lot of energy and need both mental and physical stimulation. Always remember that a tired Springer is a well-mannered Springer. And if your pup isn't getting the exercise and attention they need, they may resort to coming up with their own entertainment, and that'll include chewing your shoes and digging in your yard.",
  "care_description": "The English Springer Spaniel dog is a gorgeous but rather high-maintenance dog. Their double coats need to be tended to several times a week to keep them dog-show ready. And with their abundance of energy and smarts, you will need to spend lots of time every day training and exercising them. But, hey—that's just more time to bond with this loveable dog.",
  "grooming_description": "Here are grooming tips to keep in mind for your English Springer Spaniel:\n\n \t• Brushing: The English Springer Spaniel breed has a long, double coat that's water-resistant. Plan on brushing their coats at least three times every week. These pups shed moderately, and twice a year (spring and fall), they'll up their shedding game. So, plan on brushing them daily during shedding season. To brush your pup, start with a slicker brush to remove the dead hair, then follow with a pin brush to gently work out any tangles. If you think it's easier to give this pup a shave, think again. Shaving damages the coat, and it may not grow back properly. It might seem counterintuitive, but their double coat helps them regulate their body temperature in both cold and hot weather. You or a groomer can give their coats a haircut to keep their coat trimmed and looking nice. (But they don't need anything dramatic.)\nEar cleaning: While you're brushing your pup, check their ears for signs of infection (redness, swelling). If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nBathing: What about bathtime? You can rejoice! Springers may only need a bath every-other-month, depending on how much they run around outside. They may need a bath in between if they've played in the mud.\nNail trimming: Trim your pup's nails once a month. (If they're active, you may need to trim them less often.) You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear their nails clicking on hard surfaces.\nDental care: Lastly, it's recommended to brush your pup's teeth daily to stop plaque and tartar from building up. Periodontal disease can lead to a loss of teeth and even more serious issues like organ failure. In addition to regular daily or weekly brushings at home, be sure to take your dog to the vet for professional dental cleanings once per year.",
  "training_description": "As you train your English Springer Spaniel puppy, it's important to remember that Springers love to please their people, and they really do want to make you happy. But—these pups are smart, independent and want to hunt. Consistency in training (for example, not taking days off as well as sticking to the same verbal cue for things like stay and not switching it up to another word like “wait\") and patience (taking breaks before you both get frustrated) are key.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of training is early socialization. These pups are friendly, and you want to create as many positive experiences as you can while they're puppies. Enroll your English Springer Spaniel puppy in puppy school; they'll learn how to play nicely with other puppies and get to meet new adults. (And you may pick up a few new friends for puppy playdates. Win, win!)\n\nTeach your pup basic commands like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. These commands are important for their safety. But even though your pup may know these commands and respond well in enclosed environments, like your backyard, never ever trust your pup off-leash when out in the open (unless you're hunting, obvi). These dogs were bred to hunt (especially of birds), and they'll take off in hot pursuit, regardless of how loudly you call them back. For their own safety (and quite frankly, your sanity), always keep them on a leash when you're not in a fenced area.\n\nSpringers need a confident and calm trainer, which is why they often do best with an experienced pup parent. If you're a newbie who's willing to put in the time and effort (and maybe seek the help of a certified dog trainer to teach you the ropes), a Springer Spaniel may be a good pup for you.",
  "diet_nutrition": "English Springer Spaniels thrive on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to choose a formula that fits their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) and look for the statement that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the proper weight for your Spaniel is crucial to their health and well-being; even an extra pound or two can make a difference. As you're planning mealtimes, don't forget all the treats you give as part of training or just because you love your pup. Those calories count, too! If you see your pup beginning to pack on the pounds, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a meal and exercise plan to shed the weight and still maintain your pup's nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "English Springer Spaniels are high-energy dogs who need at least an hour (if not more) of exercise every day. This includes activities like walks, jogs or long hikes. If you're up for a little competition, engage their brains and their bodies and get them involved in dog sports, like agility or obedience. Play to their natural hunting ability with tracking events. (You'll both love it!) When playing indoors, be sure to have lots of puzzle games to keep them from getting bored. A bored pup will create their own entertainment, and for the sake of your favorite pair of shoes, keep them busy!\n\nAnd remember, unless you're hunting with your pup, don't let your dog off-leash outside of a fenced yard. They'll catch sight of a bird or other animal and will give chase (these pups are built for bursts of speed), and they won't pay attention as they cross the street or hear you calling for them to come back until they've ended their chase.",
  "ideal_environment": "English Springer Spaniels dream of a home with lots of land where they can play and explore with their family. They may do OK in small homes and apartments if you have access to enclosed outdoor spaces where you can let them play. They do well with active single people or families, but they do need you to be home with them for most of the day. If you are gone often, this may not be the best dog for you.\r\n\r\nSpringers love playing with kids, and because they're so very playful, they will need to be supervised around small kids and babies. (They may accidentally knock tiny tots over.) But these loveable pooches are excellent playmates for older kids.",
  "health_description": "English Springer Spaniels have a lifespan of 12-14 years, although they are prone to several health problems. Some of these health issues may be avoided by working with a reputable breeder. Armed with knowledge and the advice of your vet, you can help your pup live the longest life possible. \r\n\n \t• Elbow and Hip Dysplasia: These are developmental disorders where the elbow or hip joint is malformed. Over time, it results in wearing of the bone and osteoarthritis of the joint and is painful for your pup. Depending on the severity, treatments include medications, weight control or surgery. \r\n \t• Canine Phosphofructokinase (PFK) Deficiency: This is a genetic disease that prevents the dog from transforming glucose into energy and causes exercise intolerance, muscle disease and eventually anemia. There is no cure for PFK, but it can be managed with blood transfusions as needed. \r\n \t• Ear Infections: Often caused by allergies and water trapped in the ear from swimming or bathing, ear infections cause itching and inflammation. Your vet can prescribe medicated drops to resolve the infection. To help prevent ear infections, keep your pup’s ears dry. \r\n \t• Retinal Dysplasia: Also known as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), retinal dysplasia is a degenerative disease that affects the photoreceptors of the eye, leading to gradual blindness. There is no cure for the condition, but a dog with retinal dysplasia can adjust to vision loss and still lead a happy life. There is also a genetic screening test so ask your breeder. \r\n \t• Epilepsy: Seizures can occur in English Springer Spaniels and be hereditary. Epilepsy often first occurs at 6 months to 5 years of age and is generally treatable with daily medications.",
  "history_description": "It's likely the English Springer Spaniel finds their origins in Spain, but they're mainly known as descendants of the English Spaniels of Norfolk or Shropshire in the mid-19th century. These hunting dogs accompanied hunters and flushed (or sprung) birds from the brush, earmarking them as \"Springers.\" Once upon a time, the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel were the same breed. Larger pups of a litter were used as \"springers,\" and smaller pups were used for hunting woodcocks.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Springer Spaniels were divided into two distinct breeds, the English Springer Spaniel and the Welsh Springer Spaniel, by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel in 1910; and today, the pup ranks No. 27 on the AKC's popularity list.\r\n\r\nWant to add an English Springer Spaniel to your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC website. The average price for a puppy is $800-$2,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, contact an English Springer Spaniel rescue or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
