  "breed_intro": "Get ready to be a people magnet. Whether playing fetch at the dog park or cruising your neighborhood sidewalks, the large and lovable Saint Bernard naturally attracts attention wherever they go. Children eagerly hug (and ask to ride) these oversized teddy bears, and adults swoon when peering into a Saint's soulful eyes. But don't worry, Saint Bernards are happy to let you be the superstar in the relationship and content to be your attentive, calm companion. Leisure lovers will always have a willing sidekick, as this mellow dog loves anything slow-paced and won't say \"no\" to a night of Netflix and chillaxing on the couch. Just don't expect them to give you much room after they stretch out their 100-plus pounds of floofy cuteness.",
  "appearance_description": "Saint Bernards' fluffy coats (short or long) and oversized everything are equal to the size of their loyalty and compassion for their human and pet friends. They're a bit clumsy with their long legs and wide bodies, but it's those floppy, friendly ears, intelligent eyes and stately square snouts that make people swoon for this large dog. St. Bernards are always multicolored, often with unique white patches on the face and underbelly.",
  "temperament_description": "Would you ever expect your personal bodyguard to be mistaken for a floofy teddy bear? Probably not, but you should. (Because: safety first. And also because: adorable.) Saint Bernards' gentle, calm demeanor with a dash of playfulness are a natural fit for homes with older children, other dogs and even friendly felines. They'll also mesh with younger children, but littler kiddos will need extra supervision to ensure they can respect your pup's boundaries.\n\nA Saint Bernard dog doesn't always comprehend just how big they are, which can cause some consternation and tears when playing with tipsy tots or unstable adults (or tipsy adults, for that matter). Training for both humans and the dog is a must to be sure nobody accidentally gets knocked over during backyard romps or in-home zoomies. Saints are friendly dogs (and they swear they didn't mean to knock you down! They thought you were trying to start a game of tag!) and will stay that way with a loving home and positive reinforcement-based training. In general, Saints are not known to bite, but it's always important to properly socialize and train any dog. Socializing your Saint Bernard puppy before 20-24 weeks of age allows your outgoing pup to learn good manners and blossom as a beloved family pet.\n\nIf it looks like you're going to do something fun, Saints will want to join you, no questions asked. They're in the car before you can even find your keys, ready for a nature trail adventure or a Sunday drive through the country. Whatever their human is doing, they want to mirror the activity or supervise from a cozy spot next to your feet.\n\nIf you have a job you need doing, give it to a Saint, and they will be more than happy to check it off your to-do list. Saint Bernards are a working breed who love to help people. Give them a chore, like helping feed livestock on a farm or serving as a door greeter at your small business, and they'll be happy campers. Saints are eager to please. You'll know the Saint Bernard is in their element when they can't stop the drool from flowing and their tail from wagging.",
  "care_description": "If you favor strolling over Crossfit, come sit over here next to the Saint Bernard—these pups prefer daily low-impact walks followed by an evening of hogging the couch (and maybe sharing a little space with you) and binge-watching reruns of your favorite show. That's prime time for bonding-while-spa-ing (aka sponding—tell your friends), as Saints need regular grooming for their thick coats. They'll also need regular training to best manage their large size (though there's no guarantee you'll be able to train them not to hog the couch) and proper nutrition to stay happy and healthy.",
  "grooming_description": "A Saint Bernard's grooming needs are pretty high compared to other dogs, thanks to their thick coats. Some dogs have smooth, short fur, while others have longer, rough coats. Here's what you need to know about a Saint Bernard's grooming needs:\r\n\n\t• Brushing: Both coat styles shed and require weekly brushing for basic maintenance and to prevent knots and tangles in the coat. Using a de-shedding tool, like the FURminator, can be a great help, especially during the change in seasons from cool to warmer weather when a Saint \"blows their coat.\" (Sadly, it's nothing like getting a blowout for your hair.) When a dog blows their coat, they shed the soft undercoat. This seasonal shedding can last 10-14 days and might be a good time to treat yo' dog and schedule an appointment with a groomer to tackle all that extra fluff professionally. When grooming these fluffy fellows, be mindful not to get too close to their eyes, ears or paws with brush bristles. Additional coat-grooming tools that are useful in grooming your fluffy pup include soft bristle brushes, a damp cloth, or mitt groomer.\nBathing: The Saint Bernard breed has sensitive skin, so frequent baths aren't a good idea. Bathing once a month is plenty to keep this pet fresh. Between baths, Saints do well with a quick rinse from the garden hose to wash away mud from their paws or tail. However, if you live in a humid climate, weekly bathing may be recommended by your veterinarian to keep skin fresh and bacterial infections and yeast issues at bay.\nDental care: When it comes to dental health, using a dog dental paste for daily brushings is an excellent idea. If you can get your Saint Bernard puppy used to daily brushing, that's even better. Taking care of this large breed's teeth now can help prevent painful gum and teeth issues later. Diet can also affect dental health. If a Saint Bernard is on a high-carb diet, plan for more frequent brushings. And all dogs—Saints included—should have an annual dental cleaning performed by a vet to reduce tartar and plaque build-up.\nNail trimming: Although Saints are big dogs, their toenails don't grow any faster than smaller breeds. A routine trim from a groomer or at home should be planned every two to three weeks. If you hear some light tapping as your dog walks, your Saint needs a trim.\nEar cleaning: Large, floppy ears tend to stay warm and moist inside, making them more prone to ear infections than their canine cousins with erect ears. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. If your Saint likes to swim or run in damp, tall grasses, check their ears more frequently.",
  "training_description": "Saint Bernards require training from day one, as this lovable large breed doesn't quite understand just how big they are. Your Saint needs to learn their manners early to stave off those undesirable behaviors they can be known for, like counter surfing, jumping onto tables or bounding toward people. After all, when this dog grows to be over 100 pounds, that's a whole lotta dog jumping and pulling on a leash.\n\nSaints are eager to please and ready to learn. Find a certified dog trainer or behaviorist who offers positive reinforcement training or game-based training to help boost your Saint Bernard's confidence, focus and manners. Discovering what motivates your pup, whether it's a specific treat or toy, will help you keep their attention during training sessions. For the best success, be sure you have ample room to work and few distractions (like other pets from your household or small children)—you want your Saint Bernard's undivided attention.\n\nTraining your Saint Bernard dog requires consistency. Creating a schedule for at-home work or signing up for a weekly class are your best bets. To keep your pup engaged, link every positive behavior with a reward (treat or toy time), and they'll quickly discover what you want them to do—or avoid!",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best Saint Bernard diet comes from a complete and balanced high-quality large-breed dog food. Be sure to select a formula that aligns with the pet's age (puppy, adult or senior) and any health issues, such as a low-calorie food for weight management or sensitive skin formula for a dog with skin issues. Some pet parents will attempt a homemade dog food plan, but if a Saint Bernard gets too much protein in their puppy years, it can have negative effects on their growth, causing their bones to grow too fast for the rest of their body to keep up. So, be sure to run the menu by your vet first to ensure it provides proper nutrition.\n\nWhen feeding a Saint Bernard, remember that treats contain calories, too. Stick to smaller training bits and occasional snacks to avoid extra weight gain. These big dogs need to stay at their optimal weight range to avoid putting extra pressure on their joints, in turn causing mobility issues or joint damage when they age.\n\nAround your Saint Bernard's second birthday, you may want to throw them a party (good doggos deserve to be celebrated!), but you'll definitely want to start including a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement to help prevent or slow the development of joint issues in these gentle giants.",
  "exercise_description": "The Saint Bernard breed has a medium energy level. They need daily exercise, but while they grow up fast, that's probably the fastest thing about them. Saints aren't really known for their speed and aren't looking to run a race or tackle an all-day mountain hike. Instead, think of these dogs as the perfect afternoon walking companion who will amble along a sidewalk, taking time to stop and smell the roses (sometimes literally).\n\nFall, winter, spring: These are a Saint Bernard's spirit seasons—and they love rolling in the snow or walking on cool days. In the summer, hit the streets for their dose of daily exercise before the sun gets too high—don't forget water so you both can hydrate!—and crank up the AC and keep them inside during the hottest part of summer days.\n\nAbout 30 minutes of exercise a day is what you need for your Saint, though that might need to be trimmed down in warmer weather, depending on your pet's reactions. If they are panting heavily, seeking shade or lying down mid-walk, they're too hot and need to relax in a cooler environment.",
  "ideal_environment": "City dwellers and country lovers can welcome a Saint Bernard into their family. Saint Bernards can live in city, suburban or rural settings as long as they have ample space to live and play. And as long as there are people around for them to love, a Saint Bernard will thrive, especially if those people are dedicated to creating a welcoming environment for their Saint and giving them soft surfaces to play on, like grass or meadows. Spending too much time on concrete can be tough on their joints.\n\nThey're happiest when they get those daily walks during a cool time of day and will wag extra if they get to go off-leash in a fenced yard or dog park. They don't have a strong prey drive, so you don't have to worry about them, ahem, gifting you a bunny or squirrel. They are best suited to a temperate climate, but if a snowpacolypse were to hit, they certainly wouldn't be mad about it.\n\nThey are easygoing and not hyper, so they mix well with empty-nesters, singles and families with children. Saint Bernards enjoy being around kids and babies—as long as boundaries for all are respected—as well as other pets in the home and occasionally make friends with the postal carrier. If you've ever wanted an oversized best friend, Saint Bernards fit the bill.",
  "health_description": "A Saint Bernard’s life expectancy is approximately 8-10 years. To help them live a long life with fewer trips to the vet, keep an eye out for these common health problems. \r\n\n\t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: When the bones in these sockets don’t align properly, they can rub against each other and over time can cause pain and mobility issues and even arthritis. Treatment options may include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication or, in severe cases, surgery.  \r\n\t• Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus (GDV) or Bloat: GDV causes the dog’s stomach to flip and twist in the abdomen. If your Saint Bernard’s belly becomes distended quickly, and they’re unable to vomit (dry heaving or retching), are pacing or lie down and moan, it’s best to call a vet ASAP. If left untreated, bloat can quickly be fatal. To help prevent this condition, ask your vet about doing a preventative prophylactic gastropexy surgery wherein the stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. Additional prevention measures include feeding and watering from elevated bowls and serving smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. \r\n\t• Overheating: Between their large size and thick coats, Saint Bernards can quickly become too warm. It’s best to exercise them in cool weather and never leave them outside on hot summer days.  \r\n\t• Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): This enlarged heart condition reduces the organ’s ability to pump blood and can lead to congestive heart failure. If your vet has concerns about DCM, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist. \r\n\t• Bone Cancer: Saint Bernards are prone to bone cancer, or osteosarcoma. Symptoms include leg pain and lameness, and it is often diagnosed based on x-rays or bone biopsy. Treatment may include surgery with or without chemotherapy and other medications.  \r\n\t• Entropion: This eyelid abnormality causes the eyelid to roll inwards toward the eye so that the eyelashes may rub the corneal causing pain and ulcers.  Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed to correct the issue.  \r\n\t• Wobbler’s syndrome: Wobbler’s is a painful neurological disease that affects the spine in the neck and cervical region. Symptoms include neck pain, wobbly gait, weakness and trouble walking. Treatment may range from medication to surgery, depending on the severity.",
  "history_description": "What's the origin of a Saint Bernard? Let's dig into a bit of history. The Saint Bernard is lovingly named after monk Bernard of Menthon, a kind-hearted soul who lived around 1020. Bernard of Menthon established the Great Saint Bernard Hospice for pilgrims traversing the snowy Swiss Alps via the Great Saint Bernard Pass on their way to Rome. In later years, the monks enlisted the dogs to help guard passersby, and the fearless pups are also credited with saving lost travelers in treacherous mountain avalanches and snowdrifts. Saint Bernards have a keen sense of smell and path-finding abilities. The dogs' mild temperament, attentiveness and kindness earned them the nickname \"hospice dogs.\"\n\nIn later years, the Saint Bernard worked on Alpine dairy farms to herd and guard livestock, going by the names Valley Dogs or Farm Dogs.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. Three years later, the Saint Bernard Club of America was formed, making it one of the oldest specialty clubs still thriving.\n\nFun fact about Saints: It's an often-repeated myth that Saint Bernards used to carry small wooden barrels filled with liquor attached to their collars for avalanche victims to drink and stay warm while waiting to be rescued. Sadly, that never actually happened; and while images of this inaccurate depiction are still alive and well today in movies and cartoons, don't expect your Saint Bernard to play bartender at your next party.\n\nAre you eager to have a Saint Bernard puppy join your family as a pet? Consider searching the American Kennel Club's website for reputable breeders. The price for Saint Bernard puppies ranges from $1,000-$2,200, with a common mid-range cost of $1,500. These fees generally include the dog's AKC registration, initial vetting and testing for common health conditions. You can also reach out to Saint Bernard rescue organizations to adopt a Saint; keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter; or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
