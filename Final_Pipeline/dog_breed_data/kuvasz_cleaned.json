  "breed_intro": "Ready to don a cape at a moment's notice, the Kuvasz is an unassuming canine superhero. Though a large breed, they don't look intimidating—not with those big grins and fluffy white coats. But underneath that sweet demeanor beats a brave, loyal heart. Sturdy, sleek and muscular, Kuvaszok (that's the plural term for this breed) are fearless dogs who move with ease and are ready to leap into action at a moment's notice. So, they may not cozy up to strangers, but they'll happily cozy up to you any day of the week. Just flash the bat, er, dog signal, and they'll come running.",
  "appearance_description": "It's not just the Kuvasz' large size that gives them a majestic appearance. This well-muscled dog carries themselves like a boss with a proud posture and an eager gait that's almost a gallop. Their thick, white double coats look like the robes of medieval royalty—they'd fit right in \"Game of Thrones.\" They're curious and intelligent and often give the impression they're thinking or solving problems as they assess their surroundings with their observant dark brown eyes.",
  "temperament_description": "Though they look like big, fluffy teddy bears, the Kuvasz has a robust personality and guarding instinct that makes them a force to be reckoned with. As working dogs, they were bred to guard livestock; today, they may be suspicious of strangers. When confronted with strangers on their property, or if they just have a sense that something's not quite right, they can be very vocal barkers and, without proper training and socialization, may be reactive in these situations. However, with proper socialization and training, they can learn the difference between friend and foe.\r\n\r\nKuvaszok are extremely smart. How smart? They've been known to figure out how to open doors and gates to free not only themselves, but other animals, too. (The ones they like, that is!) They do well with animals they know and like if they're properly socialized starting in puppyhood.\r\n\r\nKuvaszok do well with kids they know (and who know how to play nicely with dogs), but you always should supervise playtimes. They are large dogs who may accidentally knock children over.",
  "care_description": "Kuvaszok are fairly independent, but they can't take care of themselves! Their double coats and independent streak means you'll be spending a fair amount of time on their upkeep (translation: you'll be brushing, training and exercising these pups a lot every day).",
  "grooming_description": "The Kuvasz sheds a lot (pretty much 24/7), but they typically don't require professional grooming, as their needs can easily be handled by their pet parents.\n\nThe Kuvasz sheds the most during the spring and fall, as they have a very heavy double coat. The silver lining, though, is that they have little-to-no dog odor. Plan on brushing your pup at least once a week. Use a metal pin brush, a slicker brush and a rake to remove any tangles, give the coat a healthy shine and remove the dead hair. Because Kuvaszok have such thick coats, it's a good idea to trim the fur around their eyes and toes. (So they can see and get a good grip when they're walking and running.)\n\nYou'll also need to do another type of brushing regularly: toothbrushing. Brush your dog's teeth daily. It's best to start when they're a puppy, so they'll get used to it faster. Brushing their teeth prevents tooth loss and health problems down the road. And be sure your Kuvasz has an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet.\n\nTheir nails will need a trim once a month, if they're not worn down from all their activity. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear that familiar clacking on your tile floors. (Get step-by-step instructions on how to cut a dog's nails here.)\n\nWhat about baths? Rejoice! Your Kuvasz will only need a bath once every three months, unless they've been especially active and need one more frequently.",
  "training_description": "The Kuvasz is a large-breed dog who is independent and intelligent. This combination will make training a challenge for first-time pet parents; they need a confident, calm and patient leader who understands dogs with this combo of smarts and self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\nLike all dogs, a Kuvasz puppy responds well to positive reinforcement. So, focus on the things they do well and redirect their efforts when they do something you don't want. These dogs don't like a lot of repetition, so keep the sessions short (10 to 15 minutes) and take a break before either of you gets frustrated. Remember to reward their successes with treats, praise and playtime with special toys.\r\n\r\nBecause these dogs can be wary of strangers, start socializing your Kuvasz puppy early. Take them on walks and let them get to know new people, dogs and situations in a calm and positive manner. This will help them to be more comfortable in new settings as they get older. Consider attending puppy school; it's the perfect place for your puppy to learn how to play nicely with other dogs, and they get to mingle with other people. Kuvaszok hit their adolescent phase around 9 months and you might see more undesirable behaviors than usual at that age. It's important you remain patient and calm and be vigilant during this time—and remember you'll both work through it.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Kuvasz typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Consider feeding your Kuvasz puppy a large-breed puppy food. This type of food can help prevent orthopedic issues that can occur with fast-growing puppy bones. And consult with your vet if you have any questions. They can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nEven though these pups are high-energy dogs, they don't necessarily need to eat massive amounts of food. Putting on just a few extra pounds can cause orthopedic problems like hip dysplasia. And don't forget to include treats in your weekly menu—these calories count, too. If your pup needs help losing weight, consult with your vet. They are in the best position to help you put together a plan to help your pup shed the weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "The Kuvasz has high energy levels and needs quite a bit of activity (about an hour a day). They are happy to exercise themselves in a big, fenced-in yard (that independent streak again!). You may find they're able to provide themselves plenty of exercise if they're able to roam a large area—like an acreage—on their own.\r\n\r\nThese dogs also will enjoy walking with you. However, they were not meant to be walked on leashes in the city (how boring!). They love being active and exploring the outdoors by taking long walks or jogs in the country. An adult Kuvasz is a great hiking companion and is strong enough to carry their own packs. Although they're not as fond of splashing around in the water, like, say, a Boykin Spaniel is, the Kuvasz can enjoy it and, if introduced to it at a young age, may enjoy it because it's a great way to cool off.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Kuvasz dog breed thrives in the country and on farms or in suburban areas with fenced yards where they have plenty of room to exercise. They're a good fit for active and experienced pet parents, although newbies who understand this independent dog's unique needs and are dedicated to making training a positive and lifelong experience may do well with this pup.\r\n\r\nThe Kuvasz dog is generally good with kids, as long as they're well socialized. All kids in your dog's life should be taught how to respectfully play with dogs. Kuvaszok should be supervised around other pets—especially if they didn't grow up with them. And they may be wary around strangers and might try to protect you if they sense something's amiss. When they know your friends well, they're more easy-going and accepting. Remember that proper and early socialization goes a long way to helping these pups be well-adjusted members of the family.",
  "health_description": "Kuvaszok have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years and are generally a very healthy breed. It’s important for potential pup parents to be aware of conditions they may face, so they can help their pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Bloat/Gastric-Dilatation Volvulus (GDV): Like many large or giant dogs, Kuvaszok can be prone to bloat, which happens when the stomach fills with air and twists on itself. This is a life-threatening emergency. Signs often include excessive drooling, trying to vomit unsuccessfully, a distended belly and pacing. Preventative measures that can sometimes help include avoiding feeding your dog immediately before or after they exercise and feeding them smaller meals throughout the day with a  slow feeding bowl.\nElbow and Hip Dysplasia: Hip and elbow dysplasia are conditions in which the joints don’t fit together properly. Signs include lameness, pain and arthritis. Treatments range from lifestyle changes, like weight reduction, to joint supplements and, in severe cases, surgery.\nPatellar Luxation: Patellar luxation is an often-inherited condition in which the kneecap is able to slip out of place. Signs include limping, pain in the knee, refusing to exercise or swelling at the knee. As with other orthopedic conditions, treatment can range from lifestyle changes, like weight reduction, to surgery in severe cases.\nCardiac Conditions: Kuvaszok should be screened for congenital cardiac conditions like aortic stenosis, which can cause heart murmurs. Their treatment options depend on the diagnosis.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA can be an inherited condition in Kuvasz, affecting their vision, often starting with night blindness. While there is no cure, genetic screening testing is available.\nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism can be caused in Kuvaszok by when the immune system attacks the thyroid (autoimmune thyroiditis). Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid doesn’t produce enough hormone.Treatment is typically a daily thyroid supplement.",
  "history_description": "The Kuvasz has been quite the jet-setter over the centuries, making their way from Tibet, where they're believed to have originated, to Turkey, where they got their name. Next, the Kuvasz traveled to Hungary, where they were originally bred and known for their stellar ability to guard livestock. The breed won high praise from nobility for their loyalty. King Matthias, who ruled Hungary in the 15th century, was actually said to trust his Kuvasz pack more than the people around him.\r\n\r\nThe Kuvasz first came to the US in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club recognized the dog in 1931. Sadly, during World War II, the Kuvasz population in Hungary dropped dramatically, but breeders eventually brought the breed back from the brink.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Kuvasz puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average price for a Kuvasz? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,300 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for temperament and health issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to local Kuvasz rescue organizations to adopt one or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
