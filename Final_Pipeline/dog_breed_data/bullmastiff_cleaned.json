  "breed_intro": "Bullmastiffs are the type of guard dog who will patrol your yard and home when you're gone but will leave their post the minute you walk in the door, because they're so happy to see you. They won't shower you with kisses, but you'll know you're loved when they lean contentedly against your leg. (Just be sure of your surroundings; they may accidentally knock you over!) And when you sit on the couch to unwind, these gentle giants turn into unexpected lap dogs, folding themselves like a pretzel to fit on your lap. You've gotta give them an A for effort!",
  "appearance_description": "The Bullmastiff dog breed stands tall and proud with a strong and muscular body. Their broad wrinkled head with a dark face mask, short, square muzzle and floppy ears may make them look like an oversized Pug, but their size won't stop them from trying to sit on your lap.",
  "temperament_description": "Bullmastiffs are affectionate, happy-go-lucky dogs who form deep bonds with their humans and are faithful companions. A cross between the easy-going Old English Mastiff and the courageous Bulldog, the Bullmastiff dog is the perfect combination of their traits.\r\n\r\nThis big softie isn't much of a barker. They were bred to spot, track and pin down poachers, and they had to be silent to achieve this mission—truly, they are the ninjas of the dog world. You wouldn't know they were around, except they're usually leaning against your leg or trying to fold themselves into your lap. (Wherever you are is their favorite place to be.) And don't even think of leaving them outside on their own. They'll be at the back door waiting for you to let them in.\r\n\r\nBullmastiffs are not really aggressive, nor are they known for biting (even though they have a powerful bite force). Like most working breeds, they are confident and self-assured, but can be wary of strangers. So, start training your Bullmastiff puppy early to help get them used to having visitors in your home.\r\n\r\nBecause they are large dogs who often think they are toy-sized, they can be a bit clumsy around small children, cats and smaller dogs. So, be sure to keep an eye out when your Bullmastiff dog is around anyone smaller than them, and teach children how to interact responsibly with dogs.",
  "care_description": "Bullmastiffs are fairly easy to care for. They have a close-fitting short coat which sheds some year round. You can keep the coat healthy and shiny (and keep the shedding at bay) with regular brushing. They don't need a lot of exercise, either, but you will need to spend all that free time on training to keep your Bullmastiff well-behaved.",
  "grooming_description": "Bullmastiffs don't shed as much as Border Collies, but they have more coat to shed because of their large size. Use a bristle brush, grooming glove or rubber curry brush to keep their coat in tip-top shape and minimize the effects of shedding. Plan to brush your pup once a week. You'll need to ramp up the brushing to several times a week (maybe even daily) in the spring and fall; they shed more frequently during these times as the weather changes.\n\nWhile you're brushing your pup, take the time to check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice any of the above, contact your vet. Check out our guide to how to clean dogs' ears if your vet recommends at-home cleaning.\n\nYour Bullmastiff may not need to be bathed that often; once a month (and sometimes every two to three months) may be sufficient unless your dog gets really dirty. Too many baths are not a good thing for your pup; it can strip the natural oils that keep their skin and coat healthy. If they just need a touch-up, you can spot clean their face with a waterless shampoo or grooming wipes. Clean around the eyes with a dampened cotton ball dipped in warm water or use a washcloth.\n\nTeeth brushing is one of the most important grooming habits you should develop; this will save your pup unnecessary suffering and prevent expensive veterinary bills down the line. Get your pet used to brushing their teeth while they're young. Start by brushing their teeth a few times a week and work up to every day. And every year, schedule a professional cleaning with your vet.\n\nTrim your dog's nails about once a month or so (especially if you hear the nails clicking on the floor); you can do this at home, or you can take the dog to the groomer to get it done professionally.",
  "training_description": "Large breeds like the Bullmastiff need experienced pet parents willing to dedicate the time to socialization and training. These canines are powerfully built and may not always know their strength. You don't want an untrained Bullmastiff running towards visitors and knocking them down. Help your dog become a well-mannered family member by starting training while they're puppies. These dogs are intelligent and quick learners, so they pick up basic commands (like sit, stay and come) and tricks right away. Because they are such strong dogs, be sure to teach your puppy not to pull on the leash or jump on people during training to prevent mishaps when they're older.\n\n\"Place\" is a great command to teach your Bullmastiff to keep them from bounding toward guests who enter your home. (Place is where you teach your pup to go sit in a certain spot every time, like their crate or bed.) To teach your pup this command, encourage them to go to the spot where you want to them stay (like their bed) by holding a treat over it, saying \"place,\" then giving them the treat and praising when they sit in the spot. Next, let them leave the spot. Repeat this a few times, and move a step or two away from the spot, so you're not standing nearby. (This helps them associate the word \"place\" with that spot.) Gradually, you will be able to be across the room, say \"place,\" and your pup will go right to their spot. You may find it helpful to teach them \"sit\" first.\n\nA Bullmastiff needs firm, consistent training. New pet parents may find attending a group training class helpful. You may even want to hire a trainer who uses positive reinforcement for more one-on-one training. (Positive reinforcement methods use special treats, toys and praise to keep the dog motivated and engaged.)",
  "diet_nutrition": "Your Bullmastiff will benefit from a high-quality and well-balanced diet. Be sure to look on the label for a statement that says the food meets standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Follow the recommended feeding chart on commercial dog food to avoid feeding your dog too much. Your veterinarian can help guide you on how much and how often to feed your Bullmastiff based on their age, health and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nPuppies need specific nutrition for their developing musculoskeletal systems. And puppy food specifically formulated for large dog breeds can be beneficial. Brands that are specifically formulated for large-breed puppies include Hill's, Purina and Royal Canin.\r\n\r\nAs you're planning mealtime, don't forget that dog treats count as calories, too! So, you want to find a good balance with meals and treats to keep your dog at an optimal weight. As always, follow your vet's advice. They are in the best position to make mealtime recommendations to meet your pup's optimal nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Bullmastiffs have moderate energy levels, so they don't need hours of daily exercise (about 30 to 45 minutes is plenty). And if you're dreaming of a running buddy, you may want to consider the Labrador Retriever instead. Bullmastiffs are just as happy to go on a walk as they are cozying up on the couch to watch TV. That said, a daily walk and playtime spent in a fenced-in yard are great ways to prevent obesity and boredom and strengthen your bond. Also, these dogs are moderately sensitive to hot weather, so if it's really hot outside, plan your outdoor activities around the cooler parts of the day.",
  "ideal_environment": "Bullmastiffs are ideal for homes with pup parents willing to commit to training. These dogs do well with children and other dogs (not cats), so long as they've been well-trained and socialized from an early age (and as long as children have been taught how to interact with them). Because these dogs are large and powerful, it's a good idea to supervise them when they're around smaller animals and young children.\r\n\r\nThey enjoy larger homes and backyards where there's ample room to roam. However, they can be content in a city apartment as long as there's enough space to move around without bumping into things or people, and they get daily walks outside. Regardless of your home size, be sure to keep things out of reach of their wagging tail; a single swipe can knock stuff down and break things.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Bullmastiffs love to be around their humans. Keep their crate or bed in the room where you spend the most time to keep them feeling part of the action. So, if you're gone often throughout the day, consider enrolling your pup in doggy daycare or arranging for a dog sitter or neighbor to come by and play with your pup.",
  "health_description": "With a lifespan of 7 to 9 years, Bullmastiffs are prone to a number of health issues. But that shouldn’t stop you from having one as a pet. It’s important for potential pup parents to be aware of these issues, so they can help their pup live a happy, long life.\r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Large-breed dogs like the Bullmastiff often suffer from hereditary problems such as hip and elbow dysplasia. This is a condition where the joint doesn’t fit properly. When purchasing a puppy from a breeder, be sure to ask if the parents have been health screened and had their hips and elbows certified by OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals). If you’re adopting your pup, make sure you get a copy of the vet wellness check. These orthopedic issues can often be managed by maintaining a healthy weight, providing regular exercise and, in older dogs, giving joint supplements. In severe cases, surgery may be needed.\nGastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): GDV (aka bloat) is the sudden and life-threatening condition where the stomach rotates and twists on itself. To help prevent GDV, feed your pup two or three smaller meals throughout the day instead of a large meal and use a slow feeder bowl, which forces your dog to eat only a few pieces of food at a time. Make sure you avoid exercise within an hour of eating, either before or after meals. If you think your pup is suffering from GDV, contact your vet immediately.\nCancer: Lymphoma and mast cell tumors are the most common cancers affecting Bullmastiffs. Lymphoma is a cancer of the white blood cells that mostly affects the immune system and can most commonly be treated with chemotherapy. Mast cell tumors (MCTs) are a type of skin cancer that often looks like more benign lumps. If you notice any new lumps, contact your vet to get them checked out. MCTs are often treated with radiation.\nDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): DCM is a common heart disease in large breed dogs which can be genetic. The heart is enlarged causing thinning and weakening of the heart muscle. There is a genetic screening test for DCM so be sure to ask your breeder. Treatment is typically daily medication.\nEntropion: In entropion, the eyelids roll inward so that the eyelashes can rub the cornea, creating pain, potentially corneal ulcers, and potentially even blindness. While it can be hereditary, there is no genetic screening test currently available.",
  "history_description": "The Bullmastiff origins began in mid-to-late 19th-century England when gamekeepers needed a large working dog with the speed to catch poachers. With the Industrial Revolution in full force, people struggling to put food on their tables turned to poaching game, which came with severe punishment. To apprehend the poachers, gamekeepers needed a quiet, quick dog breed. A cross between the fierce Bulldog and the large, good-natured Mastiff resulted in the calm yet formidable guard dog we know as the Bullmastiff.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were put to work protecting game at night at the expansive country estates and game preserves of the English aristocracy. There, they would keep an eye out for poachers, then quietly pursue and pin them down until the gamekeepers arrived. To double down on their ninja-like skills, gamekeepers preferred brindle dogs (subtle tiger stripes), so the dog would be perfectly camouflaged at night.\r\n\r\nSoon, gamekeepers began to argue over who had the most-prized Bullmastiff, leading to competitions and exhibitions of the best dogs; quickly, the canine became a popular show dog. Around the same time, the breed became so well-known as a guard dog they were used to guard the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa (around the late 1920s). In 1933, the Bullmastiff was recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Bullmastiff puppies today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Bullmastiff price? Expect to spend anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 for a pup. But for that, you'll likely get a puppy who's been screened for health issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Mastiff rescue organizations (either local or through The American Bullmastiff Association) to adopt a Bullmastiff, keep a look out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
