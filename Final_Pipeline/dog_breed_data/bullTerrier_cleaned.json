  "breed_intro": "If the Three Stooges added a fourth partner, the Bull Terrier might win the talent search. This class clown could be chasing their tail one moment, zooming at full speed the next, then crawling into your lap for a cuddle—right after they crash into the dining room table.  \n\nBut just like a kid who’s a bit of a joker, these pups are much smarter than they sometimes let on. This fun, spirited canine will always keep you entertained, and they’re a great dog for someone who wants to liven up their life (and add an extra dose of snuggles).",
  "appearance_description": "Bull Terriers are easy to recognize—it’s probably their adorable egg-shaped head that gives them away. Their dark eyes are reflective of their intelligent, inquisitive nature. Their coat can be a variety of colors and patterns, including white, black, black and white, tan, brindle, red, and fawn.",
  "temperament_description": "Always up for a good time, a Bull Terrier loves to put on a show and snuggle up to you at the end of the day. \n\nBoredom is the Bull Terrier’s biggest enemy. These pups have a lot of energy and a lot of smarts, so they need a dedicated pet parent who can give them an exciting life with adventure and possibility.  \n\nThese lovable pups—with a larger-than-life personality—tend to be independent thinkers. So, if they’re not listening to you, it’s not for lack of intelligence. It’s likely a sign they’re bored—and you may need to step up your pet parent game: Think toys, hikes, or games. If you don’t entertain them, they’ll entertain themselves (and your living room furniture might not love it).  \n\nThese clever dogs need a confident, experienced pup parent to help guide them toward their very best behavior. (It’s OK to let them think they’re in charge, as long as you’re the one who really is.) This all takes training and socialization, so you’ll need to be certain that you have the time to offer this eager pup.  \n\nIn return, you’ll never be lonely again. The Bull Terrier has tons of love to give and will love to join you on daily walks and other fun activities. They’re not wallflowers—quite the opposite—and they’ll probably try to introduce you to everyone in the neighborhood.",
  "care_description": "Bull Terriers are relatively low-maintenance when it comes to grooming, thanks to their short coat that sheds only twice a year. You’ll need to spend your bonding time on exercise and training instead.",
  "grooming_description": "If you value a fur-free home but can’t live without a special canine in your life, the Bull Terrier might be your pup.  \r\n\n\t• Baths: Bathing is a good idea once a month, unless they go for a big romp in the mud; the rest of the time, a pet wipe is a good option for quick spruce-ups.   \nBrushing: Brush your Bull Terrier’s coat once a week with a soft-bristle brush or a grooming mitt, but step it up during their twice-yearly shedding season (in the spring and fall). \nDental care: Brush your pup’s teeth daily. It’s a good idea to start when they’re a puppy, so they get used to the experience. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year. \nEar care: Check their ears for debris every day. If there’s redness, swelling, or an odor, your pup may have an ear infection. Talk to your vet about how to clean your dog’s ears if your Bull Terrier is prone to infections.  \nNail care: Bull Terriers need their nails trimmed every two to three weeks. If their nails get too long, it can be painful to walk. You’ll know it’s time for a trim when you can hear them tapping on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "The Bull Terrier has a mind of their own, but they will bring their A-game to training if you make it fun for them.   \n\nTheir competitive and curious nature means Bull Terrier puppies are excellent students—and they don’t get tired easily. Even class clowns secretly have a serious side, and Bull Terriers are no exception. With the right training, they can definitely nail basic obedience training.   \n\nStart with some cues like sit and stay when your dog is still a young puppy (or as soon as possible if your Bull Terrier’s a rescue). They need a confident pup parent who uses positive reinforcement (such as treats, toys, and praise) to teach various skills, such as how to walk nicely on a leash and come when called.  \n\nDon’t forget socialization, too. It’s important to introduce your pup to new people and places so they’re used to novel interactions and become a calmer adult (though the Bull Terrier will always retain that goofy personality to some extent—thank goodness). You can take your pup to group training classes or get involved in a dog sport like agility trials, too.  \n\nAsk your vet when it’s safe for your pup to start these activities (usually after they’re fully vaccinated).",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Bull Terrier, but every dog needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Choose a diet for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nBull Terriers also need plenty of calcium, especially as puppies. Ideally, they’ll get enough from their kibble, but ask your vet if you should add some calcium-rich goodies to their food bowl, like fresh broccoli. \n\nRemember that treat calories count, too, even though they’re important for motivating your dog during training. Difficult as it may be, know when to say when. Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.  \n\nYou may want to avoid rawhides and bones, as Bull Terriers tend to be good eaters who’ll swallow just about anything whole; instead, use a high-quality dog training treat. You could also try frozen blueberries or green beans (not canned).",
  "exercise_description": "Bull Terriers require a lot of exercise, so if you’re an active person who likes to be on the go, this may be your soul pup.  \n\nThis energized kiddo never runs of batteries, so they need (at minimum) an hour of high-energy activity or game time every day. Without enough exercise, the Bull Terrier can easily gain too much weight (which isn’t good for them) and they’ll turn to less healthy ways of coping (like chewing a couch cushion to soothe themselves—not fun for either of you).  \n\nThese smart pups need mental stimulation, too. They love interactive toys and games, and they’re great at dog sports, like flyball and agility trials. They’ll probably also love scent work to get their imaginations flowing.",
  "ideal_environment": "Bull Terriers are most in their element in a large home with an active pet parent—there are no lazy Sundays for these energetic pups. They need space for impromptu games of fetch, and they’ll love it if you have parks or hiking trails nearby where they can further explore the world.   \n\nThey tend to like people—it’s a bigger audience to perform for! Well-socialized Bull Terriers don’t mind a heavily trafficked house, and they’ll probably be more than happy to meet neighbors and guests.   \n\nBut because they don’t always know their own strength, they might be a better fit for older kids, though small tots and babies aren’t out of the question if your Bull Terrier is always supervised (and your kids know how to properly interact with dogs).  \n\nBull Terriers might get along with other dogs, but they might see cats as something to chase after instead of as a housemate.",
  "health_description": "The Bull Terrier lifespan is 12–13 years. Here are some health issues to be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Deafness: Bull Terriers are prone to deafness in one or both ears. See your vet if you suspect your dog is having trouble hearing, and take heart in the fact that dogs who are hard of hearing usually acclimate very well and live full, happy lives.   \nHeart issues: Bull Terriers can be prone to heart murmurs and mitral valve disease, where the heart doesn’t pump blood efficiently. If your pup has a murmur, your veterinarian will likely refer them to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).   \nHereditary nephritis: Hereditary nephritis is a hereditary kidney disease that develops in Bull Terriers at a young age, though some may be born with it. The inflammation in the kidneys usually leads to kidney failure, though your dog may have many happy years before that happens. It’s usually treated with medication.  \nLens luxation: A medical emergency, lens luxation occurs when the eye lens falls out of its normal position. Symptoms include tearing up, squinting, cloudiness, redness, a change in pupil size, and/or a white spot in front of the iris. This painful condition can lead to glaucoma and blindness, so it needs immediate veterinary attention.  \nLuxating patella: Bull Terriers can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. You might notice that they do a little bunny hop or skip—this could be a symptom. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary.",
  "history_description": "The history of the Bull Terrier begins in the early 1800s in Great Britain—and unfortunately, their lives didn’t start out so well. These sweet dogs were bred to be used in fighting rings (hardly a good fit for a canine who just wants to make their human happy).  \n\nThankfully, that “sport” fell out of fashion, and the modern Bull Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885.  \n\nNot surprisingly, these goofy but intelligent pups are not scared of the limelight. It might be why Target’s mascot is a cheeky Bull Terrier named Bullseye. Author John Steinbeck and President Woodrow Wilson both had them as pets, too.  \n\nBull Terrier puppies can cost anywhere from $1,200–$2,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also adopt a Bull Terrier, as there are many out there already looking for their forever homes. Find your new best friend at a local Bull Terrier rescue, like the Bull Terrier Rescue Mission; at your local animal shelter; or via Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs.",
