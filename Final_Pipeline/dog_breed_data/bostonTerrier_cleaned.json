  "breed_intro": "Your social calendar will be full of playdates with this “American gentleman.” As their nickname suggests, the Boston Terrier’s bubbly personality easily wins over other dogs and people alike. But don’t worry—you’re still the one they want to cuddle with at the end of the day.  \n\nThese social butterflies are perfect for pet parents who don’t like to be alone, because Boston Terriers will always be by your side. Don’t even think about hiding in the bathroom—they’ll find you anywhere.",
  "appearance_description": "Boston Terriers are known for their goofy grin, short snout, and big, bright eyes. Short and compact, they have a slightly arched neck and floppy ears as puppies. By the time they’re around 4 months old, their ears usually stand up on their own; however, some may flop over at the tip and some always stay floppy.  \n\nBoston Terriers come in three colors with white markings that make it look like they’re always wearing a tuxedo.",
  "temperament_description": "Boston Terriers are big personalities stuck in a tiny body. These confident, self-assured pups are essentially walking rays of sunshine who brighten everyone’s day.  \n\nFull of personality and pluck, they’re super attached to their people and believe life is meant to be enjoyed. Friendly, highly affectionate, and easygoing, Boston Terriers take their role as a companion seriously and don’t like to be left alone.  \n\nTheir exuberant personality can be overwhelming for shy dogs, so it’s important to socialize your Boston Terrier as early as possible and teach them how to hang out with other pups, especially more reserved ones. A well-socialized Boston Terrier loves everyone and everything, including cats and kids. Luckily, Boston Terriers are bright, curious, and love to learn, so they’re easy to train.",
  "care_description": "This short-haired breed is the definition of low-maintenance grooming, which means you can spend all that extra time saved snuggling, playing, and giving your dog the best life possible.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Bathe your Boston Terrier about once a month, unless they get really dirty outside. \nBrushing: This short-haired breed sheds a little year-round and only slightly more during the spring and fall. Because their shedding is pretty minimal, a weekly brush with a soft bristle brush or a grooming glove should do the trick.  \nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth daily. Start when your Boston Terrier is a puppy (or whenever you bring them home), so they’ll get used to it. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year.  \nEye care: Check for signs of redness or irritation once a week (their big, beautiful eyes can be susceptible to health issues).  \nNail care: Every dog’s nails grow at a different rate, but typically Boston Terriers will need their nails trimmed every two to four weeks. You’ll know it’s time when you hear them tapping on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "A Boston Terrier is a joy for the whole family. This intelligent and curious pup enjoys learning new tricks, and they love to earn their treats. Once they master a trick, they’ll be excited to show it off for anyone who will take the time to watch.  \n\nLively Boston Terriers happily engage and connect with people—they’re known for jumping all over you the moment you get through the door because they’re just so excited you came back home. Teach your clever pup good manners with positive reinforcement training. Start with cues such as leave it, down, shake, and sit, and reward their progress with praise, treats, and special toys. \n\nAs with most dogs, the best time to start obedience training is when they’re a young puppy, but you can begin training anytime if you adopt a Boston Terrier as an adult.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Boston Terriers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant and suitable for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nDon’t be surprised if your Boston Terrier is a little gassy from time to time. Many brachycephalic breeds (dogs with flat faces) are gassier than others because they tend to eat with speed; this means they swallow more air when they eat. So, use a puzzle toy or special bowl that slows them down.  \n\nTreats are great for training (and for rewarding a very good dog!), but they should never make up more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "Boston Terriers are not the kind of dog you can send outside for a quick pee and consider it exercise—they’ll turn right back around and ask you to join them for a romp.  \n\nThese pups have a moderate energy level, but just because they’re not as energetic as an Australian Shepherd doesn’t mean they don’t need exercise.  \n\nA good walk and daily play (up to an hour, depending on your dog) is great for their physical needs, but be sure to include activities to engage their brain, like puzzle toys and interactive games. If you’re looking for a fun way to bond with your Boston Terrier, they do well in obedience training, agility trials, and even flyball. These activities check all the boxes your pup needs to be happy: physical exercise, mental exercise, and time bonding with you. \n\nThat said, a Boston Terrier’s short snout can make it difficult for these dogs to catch their breath during high-intensity play, especially in the heat and humidity. Pay attention to signs of overheating and encourage your terrier to rest inside during the hottest parts of the day.",
  "ideal_environment": "Whether you live alone or have a big family, a Boston Terrier will happily fit right in. They’d be delighted to live in a large house with vast acreage and equally delighted to be in a studio apartment. As long as you’re there to give them attention, they’re good.  \n\nThese pups love training and learning, so they’re great for both first-time and experienced pet parents. Chances are, they’ll be comfortable sharing their space with another dog or even a cat—as long as everyone is properly introduced.  \n\nBoston Terriers are sensitive to both hot and cold weather, so plan summer activities during the cooler part of the day. For winter months, buy your pup a cozy holiday sweater or a chunky coat to wear on daily walks.",
  "health_description": "The Boston Terrier lifespan is 11–13 years, but pet parents should be aware of some health issues.  \r\n\n\t• Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome: Also known as BOAS, this condition is caused by the Boston Terrier’s smooshed anatomy. Brachycephalic breeds, also known as flat-faced dogs, may have difficulty breathing during exercise—or even at rest. Their anatomy causes narrow nostrils and airways, along with an elongated soft palate. To manage symptoms, keep your dog at a healthy weight and avoiding extreme temperatures (both heat and cold); severe cases could require surgery.  \nCataracts: This breed can get cataracts as they age, but juvenile cataracts can show up earlier, when Boston Terriers puppies are 8–12 weeks old. Cataracts aren’t usually painful, but they cause vision loss. Get a yearly eye test to catch cataracts early. Surgery may be a treatment option.  \nCorneal ulcers: Corneal ulcers are one of the most common eye problems in Boston Terriers. Because their eyes are large and stick out a bit, they’re more susceptible to scratching their cornea, which can cause a secondary bacterial infection (conjunctivitis). Corneal ulcers are very painful for dogs; depending on the severity, they can be treated with an oral antibiotic, an antibiotic ointment, or surgery.  \nGlaucoma: Glaucoma occurs when fluid in the eyes doesn’t drain and builds pressure. It’s painful and can result in blindness, so it’s a medical emergency. Glaucoma can be genetic in Boston Terriers, and there is a screening test. Treatment is topical medications or surgery.   \nLuxating patella: Boston Terriers can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. A little bunny hop or skip while walking could be a symptom. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary.",
  "history_description": "The Boston Terrier’s origins are in Liverpool, England, where they were bred as a cross between a Bulldog and the now-extinct English Terrier.  \n\nOne of these dogs, named Judge, was brought to the United States and sold to Robert C. Hooper in Boston. The pup became known as Hooper’s Judge and is the ancestor of all modern Boston Terriers.  \n\nThe breed—also sometimes referred to as “America’s gentleman” because of their tuxedo coats—became known as the Boston Terrier when the Boston Terrier Club of America formed in 1891. In 1893, the American Kennel Club recognized the breed. They’re hometown favorites, too, as the mascot of Boston University and the state dog of Massachusetts. \n\nIf you’re thinking about bringing home your own Boston Terrier puppy, work with a reputable breeder who prioritizes the health of their dogs. You can also look for a Boston Terrier for adoption at a breed-specific rescue like the Northeast Boston Terrier Rescue, at your local animal shelter or rescue organization, or via Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
