  "breed_intro": "Ready to be entertained? The American Eskimo Dog has all the makings of a star performer: Their polar-white fur is eye-catching, their agility is worthy of the center ring and they'll literally jump through hoops to get your attention. A rare breed with head-turning looks and a bubbly, highly extroverted personality, you'll often find the Eskie grandstanding for affection. They may steal the show in public, but it's really you they want to please. This little dog will turn up the volume on your life's activities with dazzle and panache. Your favorite pop star will never measure up.",
  "appearance_description": "The American Eskimo Dog features an eye-catching double coat and a plumed tail. These small pups come in three sizes: standard (often confused for small Samoyeds), miniature and toy (often mistaken for white Pomeranians). They are white and have a distinctive Nordic-type face accented with a black button nose. The longer hair around their necks and chests creates a ruff—ready to waltz into Queen Victoria's royal court!",
  "temperament_description": "The American Eskimo Dog (aka the American Spitz) has an outgoing, intelligent and friendly temperament, which means this breed is very trainable and makes a fabulous best friend. These extroverted pups form strong attachments to their people and want to spend every moment with their loved ones.\n\nEskies are known to be friendly and social, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't socialize your pup! Early socialization helps your dog make new friends (either two- or four-legged) throughout their life. If they've had plenty of socialization as puppies, they can live well with cats, other dogs and kids. Because they're on the small side, small kids and babies may accidentally hurt your pup, so be sure to supervise all pupper/kiddo playtime. The Eskie's personality is full of charm, and they live to be the center of attention.",
  "care_description": "With a dog this gorgeous, maintenance is required. American Eskimos shed, and that coat needs a lot of care to keep it fluffy and fabulous. Eskies are also high-energy pups, which means you'll spend a lot of time exercising and training them. But hey—that just means you have more time to bond with and love on this wonderful pup.",
  "grooming_description": "Like most beautiful things, the American Eskimo Dog's routine takes effort. Plan to carve out time every day to dedicate to your pup's beauty routine.\n\n \t• Dental care: Brush your dog's teeth daily to help to prevent issues like plaque and tooth decay and help keep your Eskimo's teeth as white as their fur. It's best to introduce this while your Eskie is a puppy so they'll get used to it faster. Be sure to get their teeth professionally cleaned by your vet every year, too.\nBrushing: Now, on to the Eskie's main attraction: their coat! It requires brushing two to three times per week and is a great opportunity to bond with your friend. A slicker brush and steel comb are ideal for the task. First, brush in the direction of the fur growth, then against it (to make sure you get all the way to the skin). Then, gently comb through to get all the tangles out. These dogs shed year-round, so regular, thorough brushing helps minimize the amount of hair that ends up on your furniture and rugs. Keep a lint roller handy and the Roomba on a daily schedule!\nGrooming: Their coats don't need a typical haircut, only a \"spot trim\" around their faces, ears, paws and behind every month or so; it makes it easier for them to move around. Thankfully, Eskies won't need a bath more than once every three months, as their skin tends to get irritated with too much bathtime.\nNail trimming: An American Eskimo Dog also needs their nails trimmed every three weeks. You'll know it's time when you hear them tippy-tapping on your tile floors. While you're at it, inspect the bottom of the paw and use rounded shears to trim any hair that might be growing between their toes. This helps to maximize your dog's traction and can prevent a slip or a fall.",
  "training_description": "The American Eskimo Dog breed is a training heavyweight—they were the first dog ever known to walk a tightrope, and they're renowned for the wide variety of tricks they can learn. Many Eskie parents even swear their dogs can learn just by watching other dogs!\n\nAn American Eskimo puppy is eager for your attention, so training is a perfect way to bond with them as well as teach them proper manners. With their one-two combo of eager-to-please personality and trainability, you'll be able to teach them as many tricks as you want. Plus, training is a fantastic way to exercise their intelligent minds (and helps wear them out).\n\nWhen you're working with an American Eskimo puppy, focus on basic behaviors like house-training and household manners (sit, stay and come are a great place to start). Be sure to use positive reinforcement (treats, toys and praise) to encourage your pup—it'll keep you both from getting frustrated. A good puppy preschool that uses positive reinforcement can help you and your puppy start off on the right paw. Puppy preschool is a great way to introduce your puppy to different people, dogs, objects and sounds, which lays the groundwork for important life skills and experiences.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The American Eskimo Dog breed typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their activity level and life stage, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior dog. Look for a statement on food's packaging to make sure it meets nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nIf you notice your pup starting to add a little extra fluff, talk to your vet. Even an extra pound on a small dog can create significant health issues down the road for your pup. Your vet can help you create a diet and exercise plan designed to help your pup shed the extra weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nWhile it's always helpful to have some tasty treats on hand for rewards, remember that treats also add calories to your dog's diet. If you're watching your dog's weight, opt for low-calorie treats or mix in playtime with a special toy as part of the rewards you give. If you have any questions, check with your vet. They're in the best position to help you find the right mix of food, portions and timing for your pup's unique needs.",
  "exercise_description": "American Eskimo Dogs are high energy, so be prepared to exercise them accordingly! Plan on spending at least 30 minutes every day to successfully exhaust their reserves. Walks and hikes can be a good way to give your dog both the exercise and social time they need to thrive. A rigorous game of fetch in a fenced-in backyard is also a welcome activity for your Eskie.\r\n\r\nYou can also get your American Eskimo involved in a variety of dog sports. Options like agility, flyball and dock diving can be fun for both you and your dog, and the Eskie's natural speed is well-suited for these fast-paced sports. Your dog will get to burn off energy, while you'll enjoy the challenge of learning something new and training your dog for these sports.",
  "ideal_environment": "An American Eskimo Dog can make a good family pup for experienced pet parents. With training and socialization, this breed can be good with kids, and their highly social nature can make for engaging playtime for the whole family.\r\n\r\nThis breed tends to also be good with other dogs and cats. Keep in mind that if your Eskie doesn't get enough exercise or is left alone for too long, they can get very active and might annoy the quieter pets, like cats, in your home. If you'll be gone for long, it's a good idea to check them into doggy daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or friend to come by and play with them.\r\n\r\nThese dogs can be very social, but some are a little hesitant when meeting new people. They form strong connections with their humans, so if an Eskie lets you into their heart, plan on spending plenty of time with your new pal.\r\n\r\nThese small dogs do well in homes with large yards where they can run around and play with you, but they also do well in apartments as long as you're also able to provide them with the exercise they need every day.",
  "health_description": "American Eskimos have a life expectancy of 13-15 years, and they don’t have a lot of health issues. Many of these issues are hereditary, so only purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder who screens their pups. If you’re adopting an Eskie, be sure to get a copy of the vet wellness exam to see if the dog already suffers from one of these health problems. \r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition where the hip joint isn’t formed properly. Dogs with this condition can experience difficulty walking, and the condition can get worse over time. In some cases, hip dysplasia is hereditary. Although the severity can vary, treatments like pain medication, joint supplement, physical therapy or surgery are often recommended \r\n \t• Patellar Luxation: Genetics play a significant part in an American Eskimo potentially developing patellar luxation. This is a common condition where the kneecap can shift sideways (called luxating). In severe cases, surgery may be recommended, but mild cases may be treated with joint supplements or medications.    \r\n \t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy: American Eskimos can inherit progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which is a degenerative disease that gradually causes blindness. While there currently isn’t a treatment for PRA, the disease isn’t painful or life-threatening. A pup who loses vision can still lead a happy life. Genetic testing can be performed on breeding dogs to ensure it isn’t passed on to future generations. \r\n \t• Juvenile Cataracts: Just like humans, dogs can develop cataracts and experience vision loss. Juvenile cataracts develop during the early stages of a dog’s life and can be hereditary. In some cases, surgery may be an option.",
  "history_description": "The American Eskimo breed has its origins in dogs who lived 6,000 years ago. These Nordic breeds, also called the German Spitz dogs, included the Pomeranian, Samoyed and Keeshond. These pups possess many of the distinctive traits the Eskie reflects today, including double coats and pointed ears.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1800s, German immigrants began settling in America. These farmers brought along their beautiful and easily trainable companions: German Spitz dogs. Around this time, traveling circuses were very popular, and, slowly but surely, the dogs \"ran off with the circus\" and became circus performers. Barnum and Bailey famously featured Eskies who danced to music alongside clowns! Their brilliantly white coats, perky personalities and remarkable intelligence made the American Eskimo Dog's ancestors born performers.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, America entered World War I, and the German Spitz's name was changed to the American Eskimo Dog due to a nationwide scorn for anything of German origin. (Today, the German Spitz and the Eksie are two separate breeds.) The American Kennel Club registered the American Eskimo Dog in 1995, and the rest (as they say) is history.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to make this pup your companion dog? You can find a list of reputable American Eskimo Dog breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The price for a puppy ranges from $1,200 to $3,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact a local Eskie rescue, watch for the breed at your local shelter or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
