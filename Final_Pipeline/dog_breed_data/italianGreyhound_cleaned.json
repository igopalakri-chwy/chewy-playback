  "breed_intro": "Say ciao to the newest love of your life (no, not your nonna's meatballs). The gentle and affectionate Italian Greyhound is ready to be your amico per la vita (that's \"friend for life\" in Italian), ready to keep your lap warm and show off their impressive speed and chase skills (though not at the same time, obviously). These small dogs have a big, infectious personality that makes them instant mood boosters—positive vibes only in an Italian Greyhound's world, and soon to be in yours.",
  "appearance_description": "Despite their name, Italian Greyhound dogs come in more than just one color. Besides gray, their short coats can be anywhere from reddish fawn to dark brown and black. These pups, the miniature version of the Greyhound, have elegant, stoic features and carry themselves with high-stepping grace. But their inquisitive eyes convey excitement at every turn.",
  "temperament_description": "The Italian Greyhound's temperament is surprisingly varied. On the one hand, these hounds can really take off with that infamous Greyhound speed when they see a small critter go by or they just have the urge to do some zoomies. But on the other hand, the Italian Greyhound breed also enjoys quality time snoozing on the couch.\r\n\r\nThese pups are affectionate with loved ones and even a little mischievous (\"Oh, you don't want me to grab these socks you just folded and run around the house with them in my mouth? Huh... OK, then!\"). They may take some time to warm up to strangers but are rarely aggressive toward people.\r\n\r\nItalian Greyhounds are great with families and do well with kids, as long as they respect the dog's boundaries. These thin dogs have fragile bodies, and if given the choice between playing tea party or playing soccer, they're probably going to choose going for a walk instead. (Besides, everyone knows Italian Greyhounds prefer puppacinos, and it's called football. Sheesh.) For pet parents living in a multi-dog household, Italian Greyhounds are best suited with other small dogs to prevent injuries they could sustain if playing with a large dog.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to cats, however, it's a mixed bag. Some Italian Greyhounds may need to be reminded that cats are friends, not food. The prey instinct can be higher in some Italian Greyhounds than others, and if they see Mr. Fluffy as prey rather than pal, they'll give chase and hunt.\r\n\r\nWith their humans, though, Italian Greyhounds are affectionate, sweet and gentle, and ready at any time to accompany you on your next adventure, whether it's a stroll down the street or a siesta in the afternoon.",
  "care_description": "While Italian Greyhounds are high energy, they are a fairly low-maintenance breed. Their grooming needs are minimal, but they do require a steady amount of exercise and training. On the plus side, you'll always have a constant companion who's eager to brighten your day at any moment's notice.",
  "grooming_description": "Italian Greyhounds are low shedders with a short coat that's relatively easy to maintain. Brushing their coat once or twice a week with a soft bristled brush or rubber mitt will easily remove dirt or any buildup. Bathe them every one to six weeks, depending on their lifestyle (i.e., Is your Italian Greyhound's idea of roughing it a Holiday Inn Express? Then a bath every six weeks is good).\n\nIf you hear your IG's nails tap-tap-tapping on the floor before you actually see them, it's time for a nail trim. This usually needs to be done about once a month, and can be done at home or by a professional.\n\nThe most important thing with grooming your Italian Greyhound is their dental care. Those small mouths can have big problems if not cared for properly. Ideally, toothbrushing should be done daily. Start out when they're young brushing their teeth once or twice a week to get them used to the feeling. And make sure to take your Italian Greyhound in for an annual dental cleaning by your vet.",
  "training_description": "Intelligent, sweet and responds well to treats—you and your Italian Greyhound puppy have these things in common. The difference is that you don't need training classes on how to be well-mannered and stop jumping on the kitchen table. (Or maybe you do. There's no judging here.) While you're teaching them to sit, stay and come, you may want to teach your pup not to jump off things, like the couch. Italian Greyhounds can suffer from leg breaks (most often while they're young and growing), so you may find the sit command helpful to prevent them from jumping down (and waiting for you to help them down) and potentially injuring themselves.\r\n\r\nConsistent training that focuses on positive reinforcement—where you reward with treats, toys or praise for good behavior—will help build confidence in your IG. These sensitive dogs are eager to learn with the right motivation. (Will Work For Food.)",
  "diet_nutrition": "As with all dogs, a high-quality dog food or homemade dog-safe people food is recommended. When purchasing dog food, be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). If you're going the homemade route, be sure to share the menu with your veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist to ensure it provides the proper nutrition for your pet's needs.\r\n\r\nAn Italian Greyhound's body is supposed to be lean and thin. If you suspect your dog is gaining too much weight, speak to your vet who can help you adjust their diet. Don't forget that treats also count toward your dog's daily caloric intake. Again, your vet can help you determine the best balance between treats and meals to keep your Italian Greyhound at a healthy weight.",
  "exercise_description": "When it comes to exercise, much like your New Year's resolutions, Italian Greyhounds have two speeds: All or None. We've discussed how they like to cuddle and nap, but boy, oh boy, do they enjoy running, too. This breed needs 40 to 60 minutes of exercise a day, whether that's a run in a (well- and high-fenced) yard or a slightly tamer leashed walk. (Don't even think about testing an off-leash walk. One squirrel and bam—you're sprinting after your dog like you're in an Olympic track and field event.) Since they are small, delicate dogs, dog parks aren't ideal for Italian Greyhounds, but with proper supervision, a dog park dedicated to toy-sized dogs may be a fit.\r\n\r\nItalian Greyhounds are intelligent dogs and need to exercise their brains as much as their bodies. Regular mental work and enrichment will help keep those unwanted behaviors at bay, and lure coursing classes are a good way to keep your IG fulfilled.",
  "ideal_environment": "Their small size makes Italian Greyhounds ideal housemates whether you live in a small apartment or on a big country estate, as long as there is somewhere your IG can get out and safely run a few times a day. A yard is a nice-to-have, but as long as you're committed to going out and doing daily exercise with your Italian Greyhound, they can be adaptable to virtually any home environment. If you do have a yard, ensure that it's properly fenced—Italian Greyhounds live by the motto, \"See Critter, Will Run,\" after all, and no one needs to spend their days playing chase (unless you're a dog).\r\n\r\nItalian Greyhounds' short hair and thin coat means they aren't particularly suited for cold weather, and you'll often find your IG curled up in a warm sunspot. If you do live in cooler temps, invest in dog sweaters and dog T-shirts for your Italian Greyhound not only because it will help them keep warm, but also because it's freaking adorable.",
  "health_description": "Italian Greyhounds have a lifespan of 14 to 15 years. Since they tend to be more fragile compared to other dogs their size, they can encounter some health issues, especially as they age. Keep an eye out for these potential health problems to make sure that your pup lives a long, healthy life. Always discuss potential treatment options with your veterinarian.\r\n\n \t• Epilepsy: Up to 5 percent of Italian Greyhounds deal with epilepsy. If your dog is prone to seizures, they will typically begin between 6 months and 5 years old. Treatment is typically daily lifelong oral medication.\nBroken Legs: Be careful of situations that could lead to your dog breaking their legs. Italian Greyhounds aren’t necessarily as fragile and delicate as they appear, but be sure to exercise caution when they’re around other, larger dogs. Some pups have even broken a leg when jumping off the couch. They can also be prone to kneecap dislocation, which is called patellar luxation.\nLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is a type of hip degeneration, which may be hereditary. Symptoms usually begin by the time your Italian Greyhound is around 6 months old, and the first sign is limping. Diagnosis is typically made by x-rays and surgery may be required.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): The first sign often noticed in a dog with PRA is night blindness. Affected dogs are sometimes nervous and anxious at night or can bump into objects in dim lighting. PRA is an inherited genetic disease and genetic screening testing is available. While there’s no treatment for gradual blindness, the condition isn’t painful for your Italian Greyhound and dogs with vision issues can do very well.\nAutoimmune Disorders: Italian Greyhounds are prone to a variety of conditions in which the body attacks itself. Commonly affected areas of the body include blood, eyes, skin and neuromuscular system. Diagnostics such as blood tests are usually needed to make a diagnosis, and treatment may vary based on the specific condition, but immunosuppressive therapy and steroids are often used.\nHypothyroidism: In this endocrine disease, the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in lethargy, weight gain and hair loss. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests and treatment is most often daily medication.",
  "history_description": "The origin of the Italian Greyhound starts in a region in the Mediterranean once ruled by the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago, and today is known as Greece and Turkey. The breed was a companion and rumored to be small game hunters in Southern Europe. Just after the end of the Middle Ages, during the Italian Renaissance, Italian Greyhounds became a popular breed among aristocrats, nobility and the wealthy and were frequently included in portrait paintings from that time period.\r\n\r\nSince having a toy version of a larger dog breed was widely considered to be a status symbol, it's no surprise that royalty gravitated to the Italian Greyhound. Queen Victoria, James I, Frederick the Great, Catherine the Great and Anne of Denmark were all fans of this tiny but mighty breed. In fact, an African king reportedly traded 200 cattle for one Italian Greyhound dog.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the American Kennel Club formally recognized the Italian Greyhound as a breed. During both World Wars, Italian Greyhounds were nearly depleted throughout Europe. Fortunately, American breeders helped keep them alive and avoid extinction. Since then, Italian Greyhounds have repopulated overseas, and in 2016, the Italian Greyhound won Best in Show at the National Dog Show.\r\n\r\nThinking about adding an Italian Greyhound to your home? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. On average, an Italian Greyhound puppy will cost anywhere from $1,400 to $2,000. But for that, you'll likely get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Italian Greyhound rescue organizations or visit your local animal shelter to see if any are currently available for adoption.",
