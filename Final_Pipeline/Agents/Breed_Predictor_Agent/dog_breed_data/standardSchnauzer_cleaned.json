  "breed_intro": "Multitaskers, you've met your match! Standards Schnauzers are confident, curious dogs who thrive when they have a busy schedule. Eager to learn new things daily, this energetic and dependable breed was raised to run farms in Germany. These active dogs will be the first family member to greet you in the morning, eager for a brisk morning walk, and they'll also be waiting for you in the evening with an excited bark and a wet kiss. Highly intelligent (sometimes too smart for their own good), Standard Schnauzers love a complex task or spending time with their pet parent working on new skills to keep them out of trouble.",
  "appearance_description": "A Standard Schnauzer's defining feature is their fancy face cut—bushy eyebrows and long, straight muzzles with wiry \"beards\" that may make you think of a distinguished elderly gentleman. But there is nothing frail about the Standard Schnauzer's sporty, square frames. Stout and robust with a short, straight back and muscular legs, the Standard Schnauzer never misses an opportunity to chase squirrels in the yard or play fetch.",
  "temperament_description": "A Standard Schnauzer's confidence is one of their best qualities, but these dignified dogs also harbor deep wells of playfulness and energy.\r\n\r\nA Standard Schnauzer's compatibility with others (both two- and four-legged friends) hinges on early socialization. Standard Schnauzers can be wary of people they don't know. They tend to sound the bark alarm at passing strangers and won't tolerate certain things like teasing from children.\r\n\r\nStandard Schnauzers are intelligent and learn quickly. They're also high-spirited and will run circles around you—literally and figuratively—if you let them. Consistent, positive reinforcement training will help your Standard Schnauzer be their best self.\r\n\r\nBred to be Germany's best all-around farm dog, Standard Schnauzers are their happiest, most authentic selves when they have a job, such as obedience, agility, herding or doing tasks around the house. These brilliant dogs live by the mantra “work hard, play hard.\"",
  "care_description": "Standard Schnauzers require a fair amount of care and attention, particularly when it comes to addressing their training, grooming and energy needs. Given their independent streak, training, such as obedience training and puppy classes, should begin early. As the caregiver of an active breed, you'll need to think of creative ways to engage your Standard Schnauzer mentally and physically throughout their life. Grooming will also be a big part of your life, so grab a brush and get ready!",
  "grooming_description": "Standard Schnauzers' hair would grow to the ground if you let it, but they're considered non-shedders. Unless you enjoy working out tangles and mats daily, keeping your Standard Schnauzer clipped and trimmed is best, which means regular trips to the groomer. The Standard Schnauzer's coat is worn tight to the body, and experts recommend they get a complete grooming, including a haircut, bath, clip and cut, and nail trimming, every six to eight weeks. Show dogs have an even more intense regimen, as they are hand stripped with a special grooming tool (meaning hairs are actually plucked so new hairs can grow), but most dog parents don't go to these lengths.\n\nIn between regular trips to the groomer, you should brush your Standard Schnauzer with a pin brush or slicker brush once a week so hair doesn't get matted, which can cause painful skin lesions underneath. You may need to wash their trademark beard, too, if it gets dirty between grooming appointments.\n\nBecause they will be spending so much time at the groomers, and each grooming session takes 1 ½ to 2 hours, it's important that Standard Schnauzers are exposed to grooming early on, particularly in terms of having their facial hair cut. Puppies should get used to being around clippers and scissors and having their paws handled.\n\nAlso, make sure to begin brushing their teeth early. Do it daily. Additionally, they should have a veterinary teeth cleaning annually, as should all dogs, no matter the breed.",
  "training_description": "Positive reinforcement training for Standard Schnauzers sets the foundation early to ensure they know the family rules and structure. Positive reinforcement rewards dogs with treats, praise and toys for doing a good job. Teach your puppy the basics of obedience with commands like sit, stay and come, and how to walk nicely on a leash. Standard Schnauzers will need continued training and frequent mental stimulation throughout their lives to stay content.\n\nClicker training, in which a clicker noise indicates to the dog that they did what you asked and will receive a reward, is also effective with the Standard Schnauzer breed. This is an excellent way to shape good behavior over time. Remember, Standard Schnauzers can get bored easily, so keep training varied!\n\nStart socializing your puppy while they're young to help them get used to interactions with other dogs and people outside the family. Take them on walks to let them meet (and sniff!) neighbors and other dogs, and enroll them in puppy school. At puppy school, they'll learn how to play nicely with other puppies and mix and mingle with other adults.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Standard Schnauzers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you select the best food for your dog's lifestyle and guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their diet.\r\n\r\nActive Standard Schnauzers need a nutrient-rich diet to maintain their coat color and energy. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nDog treats or a few pieces of their regular kibble make great snacks (and great rewards for training), but remember, treats equal calories, and you should account for them in your dog's total daily intake.",
  "exercise_description": "The high energy level of Standard Schnauzers means they need plenty of exercise. Their hearty frames are built for endurance and activity, and staying active and engaged is good for their mental health. To keep them happy and healthy, an hour of vigorous exercise every day is best for Standard Schnauzers.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean an hour doing step aerobics. (Unless that's you and your Standard Schnauzer's thing.) These working dogs enjoy playing with balls and can be good running partners with conditioning and practice (even for pet parents with a fast pace—the Standard Schnauzer's speed is often underestimated!). A long hike with their favorite people is a perfect choice for these dogs. They also love dog sports like herding and agility. Keep them adequately exercised, and you and your Standard Schnauzer will live happily and rest soundly.\r\n\r\nActivities where they can use that large schnauze (German for \"snout\"), like nose work and sniffing out certain scents in the home or on walks, make them most happy. Feeding time is a prime opportunity for scent tracking. Present your Standard Schnauzer's meal in a feeder or puzzle toys or hide treats and kibble around the house so they have to go on a \"treasure hunt\" to find it.\r\n\r\nBred to hunt vermin, Standard Schnauzers also enjoy an activity that is increasingly available throughout the country: barn hunting. Pet parents can take their dog to farms where rats are hid in hay bales in an aerated cylindrical tube, and the dogs have to find them. (No rats are harmed in the process.)",
  "ideal_environment": "Standard Schnauzers are not the type of dogs who will put up with children poking at them and invading their space, but that doesn't mean they can't be good family dogs. Schnauzers and kids can get along well if a Schnauzer puppy is welcomed into a home at a young age and has positive interactions with children from the get-go. All parties—Schnauzers and humans alike—should be taught to respect each other's boundaries. The same goes for interactions with other animals. It's important that you introduce Standard Schnauzers to other animals in a positive way when they're young.\r\n\r\nStandard Schnauzers love having a yard to explore, but they are equally at home in the city as long as you, their pet parent, take them out for frequent walks and scent work. The most important lifestyle factor for them is to have a human companion who can take the time to train them appropriately and incorporate the dog into an active lifestyle. Couch potatoes need not apply.",
  "health_description": "Standard Schnauzers have a lifespan of 13 to 16 years and are generally a very healthy breed. Of course, there are still health issues to watch out for to keep your pal healthy.\r\n\n \t• Heart Disease: Standard Schnauzers can be prone to dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM, where the heart becomes large, thin and weak. Symptoms vary, but can include appetite loss, pale gums, coughing and difficulty breathing. Medication can treat the condition if it's found early.\nBladder or Kidney Stones: Standard Schnauzers can develop painful bladder and kidney stones. If they have trouble urinating or there is blood in their urine, call your vet to discuss treatment options, which may include dissolving the stones with a special diet and surgical removal.\nHip and Elbow Dysplasia: This inherited disease can cause joints to develop improperly and results in arthritis. Stiffness in elbows or hips can develop as your Standard Schnauzer matures. Watch for lameness in their legs or difficulty getting up from lying down. Dysplasia can typically be treated with pain medication, joint supplements and, in severe cases, surgery.\nEye Issues: Standard Schnauzers are prone to cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Cataracts can typically be treated with surgery, but PRA does not have a treatment option and will commonly result in blindness. A genetic screening test may be available for both conditions, so be sure to ask your breeder.\nHypothyroidism: In this often genetic endocrine condition, the body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone resulting in weight gain, hair loss, and lethargy. Treatment is typically daily oral medication.\nHemophilia A: This inherited bleeding disorder results from a deficiency in factor VIII clotting factor that prevents pets from clotting appropriating, resulting in bleeding. Genetic screening testing is available, so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "The Schnauzer breed originated in Germany, specifically Bavaria in southeast Germany. During the Middle Ages, they were initially bred to work on farms, designed to be multitaskers capable of hunting, herding and guarding their property. Their name is a nod to their bearded muzzle or schnauze, and those wiry beards have a purpose—protecting the Standard Schnauzer's muzzle from the vermin they would hunt on the farm. Perhaps it's no surprise that these multipurpose helpers began to appear in German artwork in the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe breed (at the time known as the Wire-Haired Pinscher and considered the wire-haired version of the German Pinscher) was first shown in Germany in the late 19th century, around the 1870s, and became widely known in the U.S. after World War I. In Europe, the German army used Standard Schnauzers as Red Cross aids.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Standard Schnauzer in 1904, and the Schnauzer Club of America was formed in 1925. Are you looking to add a Standard Schnauzer puppy as a pet to your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Standard Schnauzer price? Expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 to $2,500 for a purebred puppy. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact pet rescue organizations to adopt a Standard Schnauzer, keep an eye out for one at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
