  "breed_intro": "If you want a dog who is easygoing and always up for some fun, it’s time to meet the Standard Poodle.\n\nOne day with this pup and you’ll understand what makes them among the most popular dog breeds: They’re smart, funny, and easy to train. Plus, their low-shed coat means your home can stay clean without much effort. Just make sure you set aside time for daily brushing and regular grooming!",
  "appearance_description": "The Standard Poodle is a real showstopper, with a long coat of elegant, curly hair and a sleek, athletic build. Poodles come in a range of colors, from the more common black and white to the rarer shades of red and brown. This breed has a thin snout and curious, observant eyes that reflect their intelligent and intuitive nature.",
  "temperament_description": "The Standard Poodle is one of the smartest dog breeds and has no shortage of self-confidence, says Mary Olund, corresponding secretary for the Poodle Club of America and longtime Standard Poodle breeder. They’re independent thinkers but generally happy to do what you ask of them, so training and obedience are often fun and rewarding for both pup and pup parent.\n\nSocial time is one of their top priorities, and they’re happy spending quality time with their family. Whether you have other dogs, cats, or kiddos, Standard Poodles are compatible. \n\nAlthough Standard Poodles are generally easygoing, this breed also loves a chance to show off their smart and confident spirit. “They are the most versatile breed,” Olund says, noting that these big Poodles are up for activities such as hiking, agility, nose work, dock diving, obedience competition, hunting, service work, and therapy. “They do it all,” Olund adds.\n\nThis breed is bright and intuitive, making them highly adaptable to different people and circumstances.\n\n“Standard Poodles read the room,” says Allison Alexander, owner of Leading Edge Dog Show Academy. “They can really adjust their energy level to the situation that they're around.”",
  "care_description": "Standard Poodles are easy to train and are happy with almost any form of exercise. Grooming is where this breed requires the most maintenance—especially if you plan to keep your dog in one of the classic Standard Poodle haircuts.",
  "grooming_description": "For the most part, the Standard Poodle is a low-maintenance dog … but not when it comes to grooming. Their long, curly hair needs professional grooming every six to eight weeks. Pet parents can try grooming themselves—but this requires an investment of time, money, and space, Alexander says. \n\n“If you’re not worried about your dog having the classic Standard Poodle cut, you can do the grooming at home,” she says. “But if you want your Standard Poodle to look fancy, that’s a lot of work and might be better left to a professional groomer.”\n\nA groomer will take care of bathing and drying your Poodle, which is also more complicated than many pet parents imagine. The Standard Poodle’s thick coat requires a high-velocity dryer to get it dry to the skin, which is necessary for avoiding skin irritation. \n\nIn between baths and haircuts, your Standard Poodle also needs regular at-home care:\r\n\n\t• Coat care: Brush your dog every day with a slicker brush.\nEar care: Ask your vet how often you need to clean your dog’s ears. Standard Poodles love water; clean their ears with a vet-approved cleanser after they go for a swim or have a bath.\nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails as needed (about once a month). When you can hear them clicking across the floor when they walk, that’s your cue to grab the nail clipper.\nDental care: Brushing your dog’s teeth every day is the best way to stop dental disease. Dental chews, supplements, dental diets, and water additives can help keep those pearly whites clean, too.",
  "training_description": "The Standard Poodle is an extremely trainable breed thanks to their whip-smart personality and desire to please. The Standard Poodle “has always been rated  No. 2 in intelligence, behind the Border Collie,” Olund says. This makes Standard Poodles a great dog for first-time pet parents who are new to training a dog.\n\nBut don’t just expect your new pup to know how to sit and stay on their own. Training sessions need to be consistent, engaging, and filled with positive reinforcement like training treats and exclamations of “Good dog!”\n\nStandard Poodle puppies also need socialization early and often. Socialization helps pups learn that new people, animals, and situations are not something to fear; this helps them grow into confident adults.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Most high-quality commercial dog foods that are AAFCO-compliant work well for Standard Poodles, unless otherwise directed by your vet. Some brands, like Royal Canin, even offer formulas specifically for Poodles.\n\nStandard Poodle puppies need a large-breed, high-quality puppy food. Choosing an appropriate diet for your puppy is important for their bone and joint development; these pups grow fast, making them susceptible to certain joint problems. Talk to your veterinarian about the best food for your dog.\n\nAdult Standard Poodles are deep-chested dogs, which puts them at risk of a life-threatening condition called gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). Pet parents can help keep their dog safe with a few steps during mealtimes:\r\n\n\t• Feed your dog smaller, more frequent meals instead of one large meal per day. Most Standard Poodles do well with twice-daily feedings.\nGive your dog food in a slow feeder, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy. This forces your dog to eat slower and (bonus!) provides much-needed mental stimulation.\nAvoid elevated food bowls; these may increase the chance of GDV.\nDon’t let this active dog exercise for the hour before or after eating.",
  "exercise_description": "Poodles are “as athletic as you want them to be,” says Alexander. Like all breeds, they need regular activity.\n\nAlexander recommends that, in addition to short walks, pet parents give their Standard Poodles a chance to really stretch their legs and let loose daily, whether that’s a long hike or a free run in a dog park. Standard Poodle puppies need extra time to run free and let out their puppy energy.\n\nThe Standard Poodle is up for almost any type of activity—especially if you’re involved. Keep things interesting for them by rotating through the following:\r\n\n\t• Hiking \nRunning\nDock diving\nObedience competition\nSwimming",
  "ideal_environment": "Most Standard Poodles will be happy living anywhere, as long as their pet parents spend plenty of time interacting with them. Having a fenced backyard is a plus, but these pups are happy to spend time outside through daily walks and trips to the dog park, too. \n\nPoodles make good family dogs and do great with kids and adults alike. They’re highly adaptable and can adjust to city life or country living. As long as there’s someone there to pay attention to them, they’re happy.",
  "health_description": "Expect to enjoy many happy years with your pup, since the Standard Poodle lifespan is 10–18 years. They are generally very healthy dogs, Olund says.\n\nHowever, as with any breed, certain health issues may crop up. Pet parents should keep an eye out for the following:\r\n\n\t• Bloat: Bloat is a condition where a dog’s stomach fills with gas, liquid, and/or food. It’s extremely uncomfortable and can lead to serious complications (GDV) or even death if left untreated. Watch for symptoms like a distended abdomen, dry heaving, excessive panting, and restlessness, and take your dog to the emergency vet right away if these signs are spotted.\nAddison’s disease: Addison’s disease is caused by a deficiency of essential hormones produced by the adrenal glands. Symptoms include excessive thirst or urination, lethargy, or gastrointestinal issues. Dogs with Addison’s need lifelong medication.\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA is an eye disease that causes the retina to deteriorate, leading to blindness. Although there is no cure, it’s painless and most dogs can adapt to the loss of sight without much trouble.\nVon Willebrand disease (vWD): vWD is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a shortage of von Willebrand factor protein, which is responsible for forming blood clots. Without this protein, your Standard Poodle may show symptoms such as blood in the urine or feces, nosebleeds, bruising, or prolonged bleeding from any trauma.   \nHip dysplasia: This inherited joint condition is common in the breed because of the Standard Poodle’s size and the super-fast growth spurts puppies go through. Hip dysplasia develops because of an abnormally formed hip joint, leading to instability, pain, and arthritis. Take your vet to the vet if your dog begins limping, struggling to stand up after resting, or moving in a bunny-hopping manner. Severe cases might need surgery.\nSebaceous adenitis: This skin disease is caused by an absence of sebum, a moisturizing substance produced by a Poodle’s oil glands. The lack of sebum can cause hair loss, hair thinning, dandruff, or skin infections. Sebaceous adenitis is inherited in Standard Poodles. There’s no DNA test available to detect the condition, and a diagnosis is based on skin biopsy samples.",
  "history_description": "Although the Poodle is often associated with France, this breed actually originated from a different part of Europe.\n\nStandard Poodles were bred in Germany to retrieve waterfowl for duck hunters, which explains why today’s Poodles are such excellent swimmers. Their name comes from the German verb púddeln, which means “to splash.”\n\nThe Standard Poodle’s well-recognized haircut is rooted in the breed’s past as a water retriever. To keep them nimble and efficient in the water, the coat needed to be kept short. Long hair all around “would have tired them out and made it more likely they would drown,” Alexander says.\n\nThe hair that’s left behind in the classic Standard Poodle cut was there to provide strategic warmth during and after an outing. “We shaved the rear end so they could use those strong rear legs to tread water,” Alexander says. “We kept the big hair—their mane—to help them be buoyant, but also keep their heart and lungs warm.”\n\nBecause the Standard Poodle is so smart, Alexander says this breed has had a variety of occupations, from circus performers to truffle hunters. Over centuries, smaller versions of the Standard Poodle have emerged: the Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle.\n\nStandard Poodle puppies typically cost between $2,500–$4,000. If you’re ready to welcome a Standard Poodle puppy into your home, you can find reputable breeders on the AKC Marketplace. You can also find dogs for adoption at Standard Poodle rescues (like the Poodle Club of America Rescue Foundation) or by searching Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs.",
