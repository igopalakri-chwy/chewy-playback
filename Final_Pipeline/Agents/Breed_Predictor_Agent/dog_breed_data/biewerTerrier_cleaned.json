  "breed_intro": "Biewer Terriers are small-sized dogs with large-sized personalities, lively little pups who believe you really are the center of the universe. They want to be by your side (and under your feet) every minute of the day. These charmers, instantly recognizable from their Yorkie cousins by the white in their spectacular coats, will capture your attention from the moment you meet—and they may just melt your heart in the process. Spunky, fiesty and guaranteed to light up your life, Biewers are the perfect pal to make an average day extraordinary.",
  "appearance_description": "The Biewer Terrier's multi-colored coat is perfectly parted down their back, falling gently as if it had just been combed. Their signature features include a plume-like tail, which is carried in an arch over their backs, and the ponytail that's often tied with a pretty bow on their head.",
  "temperament_description": "The temperament of the Biewer Terrier breed is easygoing but energetic. Small-sized dogs with large-sized personalities, they are happy, smart and amicable. Fearless and devoted to their family, Biewers can be a bit of a Velcro dog, so plan on checking them into doggie daycare if you'll be gone for long.\r\n\r\nBiewer Terriers gets along well with adults, older kids and other animals (cats included!). Because of their small size, supervise all playtimes with toddlers and babies; small children may accidentally injure these tiny pups. Your Biewer dog will insist on being the neighborhood Welcome Wagon, so plan on making plenty of stops to meet and greet others during your daily walks. These dogs will bark at strangers if not properly trained, but that's about the extent of their reactive ways.",
  "care_description": "Biewer Terrier dogs look like high-maintenance pooches, but their overall care needs are actually relatively moderate, when compared to Poodles. You'll spend the most time grooming your dog, but with that gorgeous coat, you'll want to spend time running a brush through those long, silky locks. Even though these pups are small, they still need a moderate amount of exercise and training.",
  "grooming_description": "A distinctive trait of the Biewer Terrier is that luxurious, silky coat. Plan on brushing their hair every day with a pin brush without balls on the ends, like the Kenshii Oval Metal Pin Dog & Cat Brush. Those balls on the end can pull the hair and break it. To help prevent breakage, first, spray the coat with a conditioner. Follow with a metal comb to ensure you got all the tangles out. And good news on the shedding front—Biewer Terriers barely shed at all. Any flyaways can be taken care of with the brush and comb. While you're brushing your pup, be sure to check their ears for any dirt, debris, redness or swelling. If you notice anything unusual, contact your vet, who may advise you to clean their ears.\n\nSome pet parents keep their dog in a puppy cut (one length all over their body, about one to two inches) to keep their coat maintenance to a minimum. This will require more trips to the groomer to maintain than their traditional, longer haircut (maybe every four to six weeks), but who doesn't love a day at the spa?\n\nDental care is just as important for dogs as it is for humans. Brush your pup's teeth every day. Start when your Biewer Terrier is a puppy, so they'll get used to the feeling. And once a year, have them professionally cleaned by your vet.\n\nYou can give a bath as frequently as once a week if your pup gets dirty, and be sure to use a shampoo made specifically for dogs. After a bath is the perfect time to trim their nails (the water makes the nails softer and easier to trim). You'll know it's time when you can hear your pup coming with the familiar tippity-tapping song they play on your hardwood floors.",
  "training_description": "Biewer Terriers are very intelligent and some can be strong-willed. They will try to push your boundaries. Be consistent and use lots of treats, praise and playtimes with special toys to reward them for their good work, and you'll win them over.\n\nObedience training teaches your Biewer puppy the basics, like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Leash skills are important; these dogs are descended from working dogs who were bred to hunt vermin, so they'll want to chase all the things!\n\nLike other small dogs, you may find potty training takes more time. Why? They have small bladders and need to go out more frequently, and their “must-potty-now\" cues aren't as obvious as, say, a Great Dane's. Consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them right after they potty outside; don't wait to come in before you give them their reward. Use the same cue words, like “Let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.\n\nCrate training is a great way to help potty train your Biewer puppy. Dogs like to keep their “dens\" clean, and a crate that's just the right size mimics that den-like feel. Find a crate that fits the “goldilocks\" zone: not too small and not too large. You want one with enough room in which they can turn around, but not one so large your puppy chooses to use one end as a bathroom.\n\nEven though Biewers are the social type, they still need proper socialization. This means exposing them to the big, wide world and introducing them to new people, other dogs and situations. Leashed walks are one way to help. Another is enrolling your dog in puppy school. Puppy school is a fab opportunity for puppies to learn how to play nicely with each other and meet new people all in one environment.",
  "diet_nutrition": "It's important to feed your dog a complete, balanced diet, and Biewer Terriers do well on high-quality, commercial dog food. You might want to choose one specially formulated for toy-sized dogs. Be sure to use a formula for their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) and make sure it meets the nutritional guidelines established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nBiewers tend to have sensitive stomachs, and though they may beg for a bite of your bacon, resist the urge to give them people food. If you notice your pup isn't eating, drools or vomits a lot, talk with your vet to see if your pup needs to switch-up their chow.\r\n\r\nBe careful of weight gain as even an extra pound (maybe less for this precious pooch) can lead to health problems like heart disease or joint issues. As you plan your pup's mealtime portions, don't forget to count the treats you give during training or just because you love your pup. Those calories count! If you notice your pup starting to look a little, um, Rubenesque? Chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a plan to shed the weight and still maintain your pup's optimal nutritional levels.",
  "exercise_description": "These energetic pups may love time on your lap, but that doesn't mean they don't need to play. These tiny dogs do well with about 30 minutes of exercise every day. Take your pup on a couple of walks around the neighborhood (always use a leash!), play fetch with them in the backyard and have a few puzzle toys for them to solve around the home.\n\nLike other terriers, they are surprisingly speedy for their size, but they aren't good jogging buddies. Games in the backyard (like fetch or hide-and-seek) give them the chance to stretch their legs and get in a good run. These dogs enjoy the outdoors, so take them on outings. (But you may want to have a backpack for your pooch if you're walking too far. They have little legs.) And even though they're tiny, they do really well at dog sports, like agility.\n\nWhen you're outside with your Biewer, always have them on a leash when you're not in an enclosed area, like a fenced backyard. These pups were born to hunt vermin, so they'll chase anything they think needs chasing. And they don't understand the need to look both ways before crossing streets. A passing owl or falcon may mistake your pup for their dinner, so don't leave them by themselves in your backyard.",
  "ideal_environment": "Biewer Terriers love their family—no matter if that's just you or a home with a lot of kids and other animals, even cats! They love to be where the action is, especially if they're at the center of it. And they're quite willing to share the spotlight.\r\n\r\nEven though they love helping to host your house parties and meeting new people, it's important to keep an eye on this diminutive pup. They can be accidentally stepped on by people or larger dogs; tiny tots may not realize their strength and accidentally injure a Biewer.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are happy in any living space, and they'll thrive in apartments—just be sure their daily exercise needs are met. They do best when someone is home with them for most of the day so make sure your lifestyle matches their needs. If you have to be gone for more than a few hours, check them into doggie daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or neighbor to come by and play with them for a while.",
  "health_description": "Biewer Terriers have a lifespan of about 16 years. They are a relatively new breed but there are several potential health issues to be aware of. Knowing what could affect your pup can help you give them the longest and happiest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Portosystemic Shunt (Liver Shunts): Like Yorkies, some Biewers can experience a portosystemic shunt (PSS), a condition in which blood vessels are diverted from the liver. Signs include stunted growth, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea, and behavior changes such as mental dullness, circling or head pressing. In some cases, diet change and medications may be used to treat PSS but often surgery is recommended.\nLuxating Patella: This is a condition in which the knee slips out of place resulting in possible lameness, pain, and arthritis. Depending on the severity, the kneecap can often slide back in on its own. Treatment typically includes joint supplements and, in severe cases, surgery.\nLegg-Calve-Perthes Syndrome: In this condition, the head of the femur spontaneously starts to degenerate. Signs include a gradual limp that worsens over a few weeks. It is believed this condition likely has a genetic component in toy and small breed dogs but currently there is not a genetic screening test. In most cases, surgery with physical therapy is the treatment of choice.\nSensitive Digestive Tracts: Biewers are prone to sensitive digestive tracts resulting in frequent diarrhea and discolored stool. Work with your veterinarian to rule out underlying causes such as inflammatory bowel disease and food allergy as well as to find the right food for your pup.\nBladder Stones: Some Biewers may be prone to bladder stones. Symptoms include increased urination, straining to urinate, or blood in the urine. Bladder stones are typically diagnosed with ultrasound or x-ray and treated in most cases with surgery followed by prescription diet to prevent them from reoccurring.\nHypoglycemia: As a toy breed dog, Biewers are at risk for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), both from not eating well/enough and from underlying medical issues such as a liver shunt. Symptoms often include lack of appetite and energy, disorientation/weakness, and seizures. If you suspect your pet’s blood sugar is low, take them to an emergency vet immediately.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a genetic disorder resulting in vision loss. While there is no treatment, there is a genetic screening test so be sure to ask your breeder if they test their lines for PRA.",
  "history_description": "The Biewer Terrier origin story is a short one. This young breed began their journey in 1984.\r\n\r\nBiewer Terrier history begins with a pair of Yorkshire Terriers bred by Werner and Gertrud Biewer, who bred Yorkies for several decades in Germany. In the early 80s, a few pups were born with the recessive piebald gene, which interrupts pigmentation so an animal's skin or fur looks spotted or multi-colored. (This gene is not common in Yorkies.) The pups were originally called German Yorkshire Terriers, but later became known as the Biewer Yorkshire Terrier; the German singer Margot Eskens suggested adding “a la Pom Pon\" because of their fluffy tail.\r\n\r\nThe Biewers made their American debut in 2003. There weren't many breeders in either Germany or America dedicated to the breed, so the pups were hard to come by. (Can you say \"exclusivity\"?) To determine if pups in the US were truly Biewers, DNA tests were performed. These tests came back with typical purebred \"cluster traits\" (meaning genetic markers were clustered together on the test) making the Biewer the first-ever breed established using science! The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in January 2021 and is their 197th breed.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a little Biewer Terrier love to your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders at the AKC's website. Their characteristics and easygoing temperament make them much in demand and hard to find. Those traits plus their relative newness also makes the Biewer Terrier price pretty high; expect to pay between $1,500 to $4,000, although some may fetch as much as $7,000 for highly desireable lines. But for that price, you're likely getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you're looking to adopt, contact the Biewer Terrier Club of America.",
