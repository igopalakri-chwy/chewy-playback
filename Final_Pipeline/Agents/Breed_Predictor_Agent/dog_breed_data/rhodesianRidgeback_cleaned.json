  "breed_intro": "You'll be working up a sweat with a Rhodesian Ridgeback in your life. As natural athletes, Rhodesians are game for just about anything, whether that's playing fetch, going for runs or hiking up a mountain. These family-friendly pups are affectionate and very protective of their loved ones. With a Rhodesian, you've got a loyal, active companion who's pretty much fearless. But they can have their relaxed moments too, and will be just as comfortable hanging on the couch after a long day of outdoor adventures.",
  "appearance_description": "The Rhodesian Ridgeback dog has a strong, muscular build with a unique ridge of backward-growing hair down the length of the back (hence their rather cool name). Their alert ears are complemented by a smooth, curving tail. Softies at heart, their round, sparkling eyes often swell with emotion for you at cuddle time. Their signature color is wheaten, varying from pale brown to deep, reddish brown.",
  "temperament_description": "Rhodesian Ridgebacks have a gentle, affectionate, caring and dignified temperament. They are independent-minded, but are very loving and loyal toward their two-legged friends and family. Rhodesians rarely show any aggression toward humans. They are generally compatible with other dogs, too, especially if they've been in the same household from an early age. However, they have been known to rise to a challenge and stand their ground in a doggy disagreement, particularly with those of the same gender.\r\n\r\nThe Rhodesian Ridgeback dog breed has low biting tendencies as adults, although as a puppy, they can be quite nippy. Overall, they're incredibly smart and intuitive. Ridgebacks assimilate information easily with a strong leader (that's you!) and can be protective of children and other pack members (human or animal), making them ideal guard dogs with a strong bite force. They bark to alert people of danger and threatening situations, but they do not bite or attack unless provoked.\r\n\r\nBecause they were bred to hunt lions, they have a strong prey drive toward smaller animals that aren't their own species. In other words: Cats aren't going to be your Rhodesian's BFF—rather, these dogs will likely chase them down.\r\n\r\nRhodesians are extremely friendly with people once they get to know them; they can be reserved with strangers. This dog breed is also highly perceptive and sensitive to peoples' energies. They can be great with kids, but early interactions with them from puppyhood is important. As with most powerful breeds, and dogs in general, you should supervise playtime around toddlers and young children. Rhodesians will be more protective of softer personalities, particularly children and the elderly.\r\n\r\nSince they require regular exercise and, because of their prey drive, can be overly curious at times, this breed may frustrate a first-time dog parent. They're better suited for an active parent who has experience training dogs.",
  "care_description": "A Rhodesian Ridgeback dog or puppy will have an adventurous streak, so you'll want to be well-equipped to keep your explorer in tip-top shape. Because they're incredibly athletic, regular exercise and good training are musts to ensure they're exerting enough energy throughout the day. But don't worry—they're also super affectionate and require lots of cuddle sessions and quality time with the fam!",
  "grooming_description": "For the most part, grooming a Rhodesian Ridgeback is pretty low maintenance and won't require frequent trips to the groomer. In fact, you can probably take care of most of their grooming needs yourself. (Hey, more time for play!) Here are grooming tips for your Rhodesian Ridgeback:\n\n \t• Brushing: They are relatively light shedders compared to other dogs, but they do shed year-round (even in the wintertime). Brush them weekly to remove loose fur and to keep the coat glossy. Using a rubber bristle grooming brush is best.\nEar cleaning: Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \nBathing: Bathe them occasionally—at least once a month is recommended, though they can go up to three months without a bath. With their super short fur, they can be easily wiped down between bathing times with a towel and grooming spritz.\nNail trimming: If their nails don't wear down naturally, regular nail trimming will help avoid discomfort and issues when running and walking. Many Rhodesian Ridgebacks don't like nail clippers, but are okay with nail grinders.\nDental care: Brush their teeth daily to avoid tartar buildup, and don't forget to book your Rhodesian in for their annual professional teeth cleaning with your vet.",
  "training_description": "Obedience training for a Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy is necessary to get a handle on basic commands like sit, stay and come, plus leash training, as they tend to be strong pullers. Impulse control training, including commands like leave it, can help curb some of your pup's adventurous instincts. But remember, you're the proud owner of a pup from the plains of Africa, bred to protect, hunt and guard, so you're never going to rewire them totally. And why ever would you want to?\n\nRhodesians are whip-smart, but also quite sensitive to emotion. Communicating with them in a neutral, even-tempered attitude is the best way for them to learn and respond. Focus on recall training, teaching your puppy to come to you because they know you're a safe place to be. This will help them regularly return to you when called, but it's not gonna happen all the time—that roaming and chasing instinct is too strong. Practice in a fenced-in yard for best results. Even in a fenced area, you might find a long line useful to contain their instincts to roam too far while practicing recall and advance their training outdoors. Despite your best efforts, sometimes you will need help. If so, enroll your Ridgeback in professional training classes.\n\nIt's best for your dog, and you, if you socialize them with people of all ages, as well as animals. Use positive reinforcement, rewarding their good behavior with praise and treats. Be patient, but firm. Get them used to common noises, such as music, television, doorbells, honks, traffic, the dishwasher, the vacuum and knocks, so they don't bark and react each time they hear these sounds. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a smart and independent companion who works best with confident and experienced pet parents who can guide them.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A Rhodesian Ridgeback food and diet plan isn't all that different from other active, athletic dogs. Because Rhodesians are so energetic, high-quality commercial dog food is recommended. When purchasing dog food, get a formula that aligns with the dog's stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). If your dog is gaining weight or seems to have an allergic reaction to food, consult with your vet for lower calorie and allergen-free options. Treats are great for positive reinforcement when training, but be sure to feed them to your dog in moderate amounts to avoid obesity and the health problems that accompany it, like heart disease and diabetes.\n\nRhodesian Ridgebacks do like to surf the kitchen counter to snatch food, so be careful about leaving leftovers out in the open unsupervised. There are a lot of human foods that are harmful to dogs, and some Rhodesians can have sensitive stomachs. Consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your Rhodesian Ridgeback based on their required nutrition and individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Right at birth, Rhodesians enter the world with high levels of energy that need an outlet. When you're considering your Rhodesian Ridgeback's exercise needs, remember that as a puppy, the recommended activity level is five minutes per age in months. So, a 3-month-old pup would exercise for about 15 minutes. As for an adult Rhodesian Ridgeback, the recommended activity level is two to three 30-minute walks a day. And don't forget obedience command practice for added mental stimulation.\n\nTracking exercises and nose work are also great activities for them to partake in. Rhodesians are natural runners who will have no problem keeping up with you as you hit the running trails. But be warned: A Rhodesian Ridgeback's speed is quite fast, so unless they're in a fenced-in area, keep them on that leash. There's no holding them back once their prey drive takes over—unless, of course, you feel like partaking in a sprinting workout. They also love sport dog activities, like lure-coursing, which is right up their alley as they were bred as hunters and trackers. Rhodesian Ridgebacks love long walks and hikes, though they tend to have more energy as a puppy and slow down as they get older.",
  "ideal_environment": "As large dogs with a penchant for being in the great outdoors, Rhodesian Ridgebacks are best suited for homes with a good amount of space to be active. Because they like to run—and are dizzyingly fast—it's best for these hounds to be in a fenced-in area when they're not on a leash. Translation: They are not suited to apartment living.\r\n\r\nThey love family life but need an experienced pet parent who can take the time to socialize them properly from an early age, particularly with smaller kids and babies who don't yet understand the importance of boundaries.\r\n\r\nWith the Rhodesian's instinctive prey drive, cats or smaller pets will be tempting targets—these dogs do best without them in their home. Make sure you introduce your pup to a variety of sounds they are likely to hear at home, as a Rhodesian's protective nature can lead to barking in order to notify you of potential danger. However, they can adapt to different living situations as long as you provide them with the outdoor exercise and walks they need to stay happy and healthy.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to navigating Rhodesian Ridgebacks' energy levels, the No. 1 thing to remember is that they absolutely need to be able to burn off some energy! It's non-negotiable in this pup-pet parent relationship. Without that release, it will be hard for them to be well-behaved at home. But as long as they get their quality time to blow off steam, they'll have no problem curling up on the couch, watching a little TV and dozing off right by your side.",
  "health_description": "Rhodesian Ridgebacks have a life expectancy of 10–12 years, but they can be susceptible to certain types of health issues. It’s good to know in advance what those health problems are, so you can keep your Rhodesian healthy for years to come. \r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Dysplasia is a condition that can affect hips and/or elbows. This inherited disease causes joints to develop improperly, eventually resulting in degenerative arthritis. Stiffness and pain in affected elbows or hips may become an issue over time. There are a variety of treatments available for arthritis that can reduce discomfort and pain, including medications, dietary supplements, prescription diets, physical therapy and laser therapy. Weight control is also an important part of managing arthritis. Surgery may be beneficial in certain severe cases. \r\n \t• Dermoid Sinus: Occasionally, Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies may be born with a birth defect called a dermoid sinus, which is a tube-like opening in the skin that extends into the underlying tissues (it’s also called pilonidal sinus). The most severe forms can extend into the spinal column and connect to the membrane that covers the spine. A dermoid sinus happens when the separation of the skin and the nervous system is incomplete during embryonic development. It occurs most commonly on the dog’s back, neck and upper spine. This condition is heritable, so affected dogs should not be bred. A dermoid sinus may require surgical treatment, depending on the specifics of your dog’s condition. \r\n \t• Food-Induced Atopic Dermatitis: Rhodesian Ridgebacks are more prone to this condition, which means that allergies to specific foods can trigger some skin issues. The presence of skin rashes, other skin lesions and/or excessive scratching and itching should prompt a veterinary evaluation. Your veterinarian may prescribe medication or suggest a diet trial to diagnose the underlying condition. \r\n \t• Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy: Rhodesian Ridgebacks may be affected by this congenital health issue that causes seizures beginning around 6 months old. The seizures usually occur in the front half of the dog’s body when the pup is relaxed or dozing off to sleep, and are characterized by intense, frequent uncontrolled muscle movements. Consult with your vet if your dog is experiencing seizures or seizure-like episodes. The condition can be treated with medication. Genetic testing is available to identify carriers of this condition, and affected dogs should not be used for breeding purposes. \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs and is caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland due to thyroid inflammation or thyroid atrophy.  Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through blood testing, so thyroid levels should be a normal part of screening bloodwork as Rhodesians age. Medications are available to manage the condition.",
  "history_description": "The Rhodesian Ridgeback traces their origins to the African country of Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe. They were created by crossbreeding the South African Khoikhoi tribe hunting dog and other breeds like Greyhounds and Terriers, which had been transported from Dutch colonists known as the Boers. Rhodesian Ridgebacks soon became experts at navigating the African terrain and being resilient to pests, such as the tsetse fly.\r\n\r\nCornelius van Rooyen, a hunter from Rhodesia, introduced two Rhodesian Ridgebacks into his pack of lion dogs in the late 19th century. He discovered they had no problem holding their own against lions, giving hunters the time they needed to prep and aim their rifles. Rhodesian Ridgebacks could trot alongside men on horseback and scare off other predators like baboons and leopards. They'd run off to catch antelope and bring it back for dinner. Devoted and loyal to their humans, they guarded homes and were great companions for adults and children.\r\n\r\nIn 1922, big-game hunting was being phased out in South Africa, and the Rhodesian Ridgeback, also called the African Lion Hound, was at risk of becoming extinct. At the time, Ridgebacks ranged in size and appearance from Bull Terriers to Great Danes, so a group of breed enthusiasts organized a meeting to set the breed's standard. The panel decided that the Dalmatian would be used as the basis for the breed standard moving forward. The Rhodesian Ridgeback was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1955 and is its 110th breed.\r\n\r\nSo if you're considering the Rhodesian Ridgeback as a pet, where is the best place to find puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Rhodesian Ridgeback breeders on the AKC website. Depending on the breeder, expect the cost of a Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy to be $700-$2,000. For that price, you're likely getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to rescue organizations to adopt a Rhodesian,  keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
