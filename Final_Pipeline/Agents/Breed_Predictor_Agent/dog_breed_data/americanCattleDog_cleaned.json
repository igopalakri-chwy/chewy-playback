  "breed_intro": "As their name implies, Australian Cattle Dogs (aka Blue Heeler or Australian Heeler) are born and raised to herd cattle. Don't have cattle for them to herd? Then you just found a new workout buddy. Like most herding breeds, these pups are high-energy, agile and ready to get to W-O-R-K. Combine those traits with their sharp wit and you've got a furry partner in crime who's always ready for action.",
  "appearance_description": "Blue Heelers always have a glint in their eyes as if they're ready to share in your next adventure (they are!). These people-pleasers are born with white coats and get their own bespoke looks—bluish-gray or red with speckles—as they grow up. Their pointy ears and angular faces are reminiscent of Australia's wild dingo, of which they're related. But while their wild looks and compact, muscular build say, \"I'm all business,\" their expressive faces say, \"I'm all yours.\"",
  "temperament_description": "Australian Cattle Dogs were bred to be working dogs and are classified as members of the herding group (dogs born to herd livestock). Most of these dogs are at their happiest when working—or at least staying busy. As such, this breed thrives in active households and hates being bored.\n\nBecause they're herders, raising an Australian Cattle Dog means training and socialization are important. This is an independent breed who doesn't want to share. So, start introducing your pup to people, other dogs and situations while they're young to help them be accepting of new experiences as they grow up. When it comes to obedience training, consistency is important. Regular training sessions will help this tenacious breed be a well-behaved family member. Australian Cattle Dogs may sound like a handful, but with confident pet parents to channel their energy the right way, these dogs are unstoppable.",
  "care_description": "The Australian Cattle Dog breed has hard work and people-pleasing in their DNA, but that doesn't make the breed low maintenance. Daily activity and training will take more time than grooming, but they're happy to take up exercising with you as a substitute for farm life.",
  "grooming_description": "While they blow their coats twice a year, Australian Cattle Dogs don't shed year-round. When they do shed, their undercoats typically shed in tufts and clumps (called \"coat blowing\"). Here are some grooming tips for your Australian Cattle Dog:\r\n\n\t• Brushing: Pet parents should brush their dogs at least once a week; but when they're shedding their coats, you'll probably want to bump that up to at least two times a week, so you can brush away the dead hair. Natural bristle brushes or slickers are great for regular maintenance, and rakes are recommended when they blow their coats.\nBathing: In addition to consistent brushing, you'll want to bathe them about once a month.\nDental care: Brush your Australian Cattle Dog's teeth daily. The best way to make oral care easier for you and your dog is to start when they're a puppy. An early introduction to toothbrushing will get them used to the handling and the feel of the brush, making it far easier as they get older. If you're adopting an older dog, your vet can show you how to do it in a way that's easy for everyone. In addition to frequent toothbrushing, be sure to have your dog's teeth professionally cleaned by your vet at least once a year.\nNail trimming: Fortunately, as an active dog, their nails should wear down naturally, and they won't require as much intervention to keep them in check. A good rule of thumb is if you can hear their nails clicking when they walk, it's probably time for a trim.",
  "training_description": "Because they're active, independent and smart, Blue Heelers need a confident pup parent who understands this breed's need for consistent training and patience. This \"stubborn streak\" is often frustrating for a newbie.\n\nFor a Blue Heeler, a combination of brilliance and boredom is not a good mix. They'll create their own activities—like chewing your shoes or digging a hole in a rug. Lucky for you, they're incredibly intelligent, so pet parents will find that they are easy to train. Australian Cattle Dog puppies love positive reinforcement—treats, praise, scratches and playtime with toys to reward your pup for a job well done.\n\nProper socialization early on, where you expose them to new experiences in a safe and calm manner, also is important to ensure they become well-adjusted adults. Puppy training school is a great place not only to learn how to play nicely with other dogs (and meet new people) but also learn to sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Australian Cattle Dogs don't require any specific type of food or diet. Most high-quality foods that are commercially available should suffice. Remember, too, that there's no one- size-fits-all plan for dogs and their nutrition. Additionally, your dog's diet should take their age, overall health and activity levels into consideration.\n\nKibble is often recommended for dogs as the hard, crunchy texture has the added benefit of scraping or cleaning their teeth while they chew. And while kibble may be ideal for young pups, you might consider switching to soft or canned varieties to help your dog eat comfortably as they age.\n\nAustralian Cattle Dogs are highly active, so diets and foods that are high in protein are best. That said, be sure to consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to guide you in picking the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Remember, an exercised cattle herding dog is a happy cattle herding dog—and one who won't mess up your home because they're bored. Australian Cattle Dogs are hardwired to be working dogs, so their exercise needs and activity requirements are off the charts. They'll need more than an evening walk or a little fetch in the backyard for a few minutes. Plan to spend one to two hours a day engaging your dog in some form of exercise.\n\nSpeed and agility are the calling cards of these pups, and while speeds tend to vary from dog to dog, Blue Heelers can reach nearly 30 mph at full sprint. That's why these pups love parents with active lifestyles—daily walks or jogs (and playtime!) are important. Dog sports and agility training are also excellent activities for these balls of energy.\n\nGiven how smart they are, Australian Cattle Dogs will also benefit from mental exercise in the form of puzzles and games.",
  "ideal_environment": "Australian Cattle Dogs need highly active people who have the time to burn through their (almost limitless) energy reserves every day. Bonus points if you take them on longer adventures over the weekend—wide-open spaces are ideal for satisfying their puppy wanderlust. Not doable? A large yard would be the next best thing. If you have a small apartment, you'll need access to a park or other outdoor area for your pup to thrive.\n\nAustralian Cattle Dogs will likely do better in families with older kids, but if children of all ages are taught how to properly interact with dogs and pet parents supervise all play times with small kids and babies, there shouldn't be a problem. Also note that this breed doesn't typically mix well with other pets either, and they can be suspicious of strangers.",
  "health_description": "While the Australian Cattle Dog breed is known to have a sturdy constitution and a robust life expectancy of 12-16 years, there are some health issues to look out for in the breed. \r\n\n\t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): Australian Cattle Dogs are at higher risk for late/adult-onset PRA. Initially, PRA presents itself as retinal deterioration, and over time, it can lead to a total loss of vision in your dog. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and widened pupils. Sometimes the development of cataracts may occur in the degeneration’s late stages. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for PRA. If this happens, dogs with vision loss can still live happy lives with the love of parents who help them navigate the world around them. \r\n\t• Hip Dysplasia: Australian Cattle Dogs are also susceptible to hip dysplasia. This inherited condition arises when the hip joint’s ball and socket fail to fit snugly together. Common symptoms include limping, “bunny hopping” (especially when running) and trouble jumping. Pet parents may be happy to know that there are various treatments for hip dysplasia, ranging from lifestyle changes (e.g. dieting and weight loss) and medications to surgery. \r\n\t• Deafness: Deafness in heelers is typically an inherited condition. This impairment can vary widely from dog to dog. Common indications of deafness include excessive barking and a lack of reaction to normal noises. Currently, there is no treatment for deafness in dogs. Again, pet parents are encouraged to help their pups navigate the world as best they can. Australian Cattle Dogs are extremely intelligent and highly trainable, so teaching them hand signals can be very useful as they lose their hearing.",
  "history_description": "The origin of the Australian Cattle Dog began in the 19th century when the British brought the Smithfield sheepdog to Australia. This dog, however, did not fare too well on the rough terrain and sweltering heat, so Australian settlers quickly sought to create a herding breed to thrive in that environment.\n\nInitially, Smithfields were bred with dingoes as well as the Scottish Highland Collie. The Blue Heeler we know today is a cross between a mixed dingo-Collie breed and Dalmatian.\n\nWhile their history began in Australia, the breed first came to America in 1950. Australian Cattle Dogs were admitted to American Kennel Club in 1980, and they became a charter member of AKC Herding Group at its inception.\n\nWhen looking for information on the Australian Cattle Dog, you'll find this breed has plenty of aliases, including the Queensland Heeler (a nod to its origins) and Blue Heeler. The term heeler came to be associated with them as a clever reference to their herding style of nipping at the heels of cattle to move them along, while the term blue refers to their popular blue-gray speckled coats.\n\nIf you're looking for an Australian Cattle Dog puppy, you can find reputable breeders at the American Kennel Club's website. You can expect puppies to cost between $600-$1,000, but they can go upwards of $2,000 for championship lines. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, reach out to Blue Heeler rescues or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
