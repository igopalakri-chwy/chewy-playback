  "breed_intro": "You’ve heard of someone trying to break into a house, but what about someone trying to break out? It’s not a horror film—it’s just your Siberian Husky’s standard day.  \n\nIf you see your Husky fumbling with the doorknob, they’re not being silly; they really want to go out and explore the world. These smart, clever pups will do anything for an adventure, and that includes devising an escape plan.  \n\nSo, lock your doors, move your trash cans away from the fence (they’re a perfect springboard), and lace up your hiking boots; this pup needs adventure, and they need it now. In return, you’ll get an affectionate, loyal best friend.",
  "appearance_description": "The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized dog who’s athletic and (let’s face it) strikingly attractive. With a thick, fluffy double coat, they have brown or sparkling blue eyes (or sometimes one of each!) with an air of attentiveness.",
  "temperament_description": "As smart and friendly dogs, Huskies are wonderful companions who thrive on social interaction and outdoor adventures. They need to be surrounded by people and other dogs, and many will talk to you using howls, growls, and whimpers (neighbors be warned!). \n\nIf you tend to have lots of people over, your Husky will likely love it and charm everyone they meet. In fact, although they can be very independent-minded at times, these pups don’t like to be alone for long.   \n\nIf you’re away from the house a lot, get them a sitter or let them hang at doggy daycare so they have company.   \n\nThese cheeky canines are (quite famously) escape artists, so you’ll need to keep a close eye on your Husky. They’ll figure out ways to get outdoors that you wouldn’t have imagined.  \n\nSiberian Huskies are quite intelligent, but they can become easily bored, so training sessions can be a challenge. As a pet parent, you’ll need to be consistent in your schedule and successful in getting your pup’s undivided attention.  \n\nSiberian Huskies usually love kids and other dogs—getting a second Husky is even a good option for many families. However, they may not be the best fit for cats and tiny dogs, as they might decide to chase them. \n\nBut with an experienced pet parent and the right training, a Husky will be a polite, well-behaved member of your family.",
  "care_description": "Siberian Huskies need experienced pet parents who are willing to put in the time it takes to meet their needs. Huskies are often called high-maintenance dogs because they need lots of grooming, lots of patient training, and lots of daily exercise.",
  "grooming_description": "You’ll need to help your Husky look and feel their best by controlling their heavy shedding.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: Give your pup a bath every three months unless they get super dirty or stinky after one of their adventures. If you live in a warmer climate, your Husky might need a bath more frequently. Talk to your vet for the best advice. \r\n\n\t• Use a dog shampoo that’s just right: For example, a puppy shampoo is best for Husky puppies, but a soothing shampoo might be best if your dog has dry, itchy skin.  \r\n\nBrushing: Brush your dog with a pin brush three to five times a week, as these pups tend to shed a lot. During high shedding seasons (in the fall and spring), use an undercoat rake every day. \nDental care: Brush your pup’s teeth daily. A vet can show you the best tooth-brushing techniques and recommend a dog-safe toothpaste. Get your dog’s teeth professionally cleaned once a year. \nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails every few months or anytime they start to touch the floor when the dog is standing (too-long nails may be painful). You’ll hear when it’s time for a trim because they’ll make clacking noises on hard surfaces. Use a nail clipper for dogs or ask your vet or groomer to help.",
  "training_description": "Start off your Siberian Husky puppy with some basic obedience training—like sit, stay, and come. It’s ideal to begin when they’re still a young puppy, but you can begin as soon as possible if you adopt them when they’re already an adult. It’s never too late to learn! \n\nDon’t forget socialization, too. It’s important to introduce your pup to new people and places so they’re accustomed to novel interactions and become a chill(er) adult. Taking your dog to group training classes or getting involved in a dog sport like agility trials are both good options for socialization. \n\nAs a working breed, Siberian Huskies love to have a purpose, which makes them very eager to learn. However, as a pet parent, you’ll need a well-prepared plan. Your Husky is smart enough to know if you’re winging it, and when they realize there’s no goal, they might choose not to listen.    \n\nConsistent, structured training sessions with clear goals is best. Always use positive reinforcement—praise, treats, and toys—to teach your pup how to be on their very best behavior.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no go-to nutrition plan for your Husky, as each dog has different needs. But every pup does need a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards.  \n\nChoose a formula that’s made for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), and consider a large-breed diet, especially for Husky puppies, for healthy growth.   \n\nYour veterinarian can help determine your dog’s ideal diet and feeding times, as your Husky might not need as much food as you think, and many people overfeed this breed.  \n\nDon’t forget to calculate treats into your pup’s daily meal plan. These calories count, too, and should never be more than 10% of your dog’s daily diet.",
  "exercise_description": "A busy Husky is a happy Husky. This breed is very smart and easily bored, so Husky dogs need a devoted pet parent who can help them engage their brain and body every single day.  \n\nHuskies should get at least two hours of exercise every day, whether that’s long walks (change your route often for variety), hikes (Huskies love being out in nature), or competitive dog sports like agility trials. \n\nSiberian Huskies will run off when they see, hear, or smell something exciting, so keep them on a leash when they’re not in a fenced space. \n\nHuskies also often get the zoomies—it’s normal and adorable behavior, but if it’s happening a lot, it could be a sign that your dog needs some additional ways to expend their energy. So up their routine with an additional walk or game of fetch.",
  "ideal_environment": "Siberian Huskies are best suited for cold climates, but they’ll adapt to warmer environments if they have access to air-conditioning. So, in the hotter months, schedule outdoor time in the early morning or in the evening when it’s cooler. \n\nHuskies love playing outdoors, so a yard with a fence is ideal. These clever canines are escape artists, and they will try to go on neighborhood escapades by themselves if there’s nothing to stop them. They need an experienced pet parent who keeps an eye on them and stops them from hatching dangerous escape plans.  \n\nThey usually make good family pets and do well with other pets and kids. However, they may need supervision around small kids or cats, as an energetic Husky might accidentally knock someone over during playtime. But overall, a well-socialized Husky will thrive in a home with plenty of outlets for their energy and curious mind.  \n\nDon’t forget to give them lots of opportunities for mental stimulation. A bored Husky will look for ways to entertain themselves, and you might not love their new hobby of chewing or digging.",
  "health_description": "The typical Siberian Husky lifespan is 12–14 years. Here are some potential health issues to be aware of: \r\n\n\t• Epilepsy: Huskies are prone to seizures caused by epilepsy, a neurological disorder that typically begins when a dog is between 6 months and 5 years old. It’s treated with oral medication. \nEye issues: Cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) are not uncommon in Huskies, and while neither is painful, they do lead to blindness. Corneal dystrophy is another risk, which causes cloudy eyes.  \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones doesn’t properly fit. It’s an inherited condition that can be made worse if a pup is overweight, and it eventually leads to arthritis and pain. More severe cases may require surgery, but the condition is often treated with medication, joint supplements, weight management, and/or physical therapy. \nHypothyroidism: Common in this breed, hypothyroidism includes symptoms like lethargy, hair loss, skin and ear infections, and weight gain. A blood test can diagnosis it, and treatment is a daily oral medication. \nPemphigus foliaceus: This autoimmune skin disorder occurs when the immune system starts to attack the skin instead of fighting off foreign invaders. It can be very painful for pups if left untreated, so talk to your vet if you notice scales or crusts on the skin, hair loss, itching and scratching, depigmentation of the nose or lips, a fever, fatigue, or lack of appetite.  \nVon Willebrand disease: Siberian Huskies are susceptible to von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder where the blood doesn’t clot properly. There’s no cure, but your vet can test your dog for this disorder.",
  "history_description": "Not surprisingly, Siberian Huskies were originally bred as working dogs in Russia—Siberia, specifically. They worked alongside indigenous Siberians, providing companionship and traveling over miles of tundra in frigid temperatures.  \n\nThe Siberian Husky’s work extended beyond Siberia when folks seeking fortune brought the breed to Alaska to pull sleds during the Gold Rush era of the late 1800s and early 1900s. At this time, they also participated in sled-dog races. \n\nIn 1925, the “serum run” was a dog-sled relay over 600 miles in fewer than six days to rush a lifesaving medication to Nome, Alaska, where there was a diphtheria epidemic. Huskies were hailed as heroes, and the lead dog in the final stage of the journey, Balto, was commemorated with a statue in New York City’s Central Park.  \n\nDuring World War II, Siberian Huskies also served in the U.S. Army’s Search and Rescue Unit in the Arctic. In 1930, the American Kennel Club recognized Siberian Huskies as a breed, and the Siberian Husky Club of America was formed in 1938. Today, the Siberian Husky is a popular family pet in the U.S. \n\nSiberian Husky puppies cost between $700–$1,200. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also adopt a Siberian Husky. Search for a local Siberian Husky Rescue like Husky House, keep an eye out at your local shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
