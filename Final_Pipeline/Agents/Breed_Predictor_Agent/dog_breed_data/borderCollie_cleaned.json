  "breed_intro": "The Border Collie is the class valedictorian of canines. These bright overachievers are not only one of the smartest—OK, maybe the smartest—dog breeds out there, but they’re also star athletes. \n\nIf these dogs were in high school, they’d be rife with extracurriculars. Border Collie dogs excel at running, search and rescue, and anything else that lets them be active and around others. A true go-getter, Border Collies are good at lots of things, and being your best friend is one of them.",
  "appearance_description": "Athletic and active Border Collies exude strength, and their oval eyes give off an intensive, expressive gaze. Their adorably twitchy ears are always alert as they take in the world around them, and their tail stands proudly when they’re happy or excited.  \n\nThey have double-coated fur, and it’s possible to have one of two types: a rougher medium-length coat or a smoother short-haired coat. Border Collie colors run the gamut.",
  "temperament_description": "Like an overachieving human with a to-do list, the Border Collie finds joy in routine, purpose, and fulfilling tasks. Without an assigned job, they may create their own list (think chewing socks or digging holes), so make sure to keep them focused on healthy diversions.  \n\nWith a trail of toys in their wake and a love of their person, Border Collies are the quintessential dog. Back in the day, they were bred for herding sheep, and it’s a role that they still take seriously (even when the sheep are nowhere to be found). They might try to herd other pets or even people, so it’s ideal to socialize your Border Collie early on to get them used to roommates, whether two- or four-legged.  \n\nThey appreciate routine and may get overwhelmed if the house is too chaotic, so keep things as orderly as possible with these pups and follow a schedule where they can predict their next walk or playdate.   \n\nBorder Collies are a great family dog. Affectionate and happy to be part of your pack, they just need guidance on their role. They’ll see you as an equal and want you to tell them everything you’re doing and why. They’ll also shower you with affection so you’ll never feel alone—even when you’d like to be, for better or worse.  \n\nLoyal and caring, the Border Collie is also pretty sure that they know best, so don’t be surprised when they appoint themselves Park Ranger at the dog run. Train them when they’re young so they learn to relax a bit and understand that not everything is a herding opportunity.",
  "care_description": "A Border Collie may be highly intelligent, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need guidance. Plenty of exercise, human interaction, mental stimulation, and a steady routine that includes grooming, training, and outdoor “tasks” will set these people-pleasing pups up for success.",
  "grooming_description": "Whatever your Border Collie’s coat type, be prepared for shedding all year-round. You may need to vacuum daily in the fall and spring when they tend to shed the most. Otherwise, their grooming needs are pretty low-key. \r\n\n\t• Bathing: Border Collies don’t need frequent baths unless they get messy, which tends to happen, given they love being outdoors. Give them a nice scrub if they’re dirty. Always have a towel by the door so you can wipe off their feet and undercoat when they come inside. \nBrushing: Brush your dog every few days (or daily during the spring and fall shedding seasons) to remove tangles and dried mud from their coat and tail. Think of these brushing sessions as a bonding experience. \nEar care: Their ears are prone to waxy buildup, so clean them regularly to prevent ear infections. \nNail care: Trim your Border Collie’s nails once or twice a month.  \nSkin care: Border Collies may get dry, itchy skin under their double coat, so ask your vet how to best treat this.",
  "training_description": "Border Collies, originally bred as herding dogs, need mental stimulation and training—or else these smart pups will try to train you. Keep sessions short and engaging, especially when they’re puppies.  \n\nBecause Border Collies are hardwired to please you, setting an obedience foundation with plenty of positive reinforcement will reap tons of long-term rewards. Basic cues such as sit and stay are a walk in the park for this highly intelligent breed, and they’ll quickly progress to more complicated cues if you stay consistent with lessons.  \n\nDaily training sessions are ideal for this studious canine. For extra guidance, seek out a certified dog trainer. \n\nBorder Collies who’ve aced basic training might appreciate agility training. Think of it as college for your Border Collie—a chance to learn to balance, jump, and show off their skills. In their heart of hearts, they just want to impress you and for you to be proud.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Border Collie, but every dog needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards and is right for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). The best food depends on a few questions: \r\n\n\t• How much does your Border Collie exercise? \nWhat is their age? \nWhat is their weight? \nDo they have any allergies? \r\n\nA vet can assess the best food for your Border Collie based on their size, age, medical history, and activity level.  \n\nBorder Collies can sometimes develop food allergies, which may manifest as a dry, itchy coat or an upset stomach. Changing their diet can help, but discuss it with your vet first. A limited ingredient elimination diet or switching to a hypoallergenic formula may be necessary.",
  "exercise_description": "Border Collies need a solid one to two hours of daily exercise, and this is where agility training can be handy. Set up a course in your backyard (try these weave poles). If you enjoy a little friendly competition, agility contests may be a fun activity. \n\nWhile Border Collies can also entertain themselves with interactive toys, they need dedicated playtime, interaction, and long walks with their person. Activities such as running, scent walks, or games like fetch are ideal.  \n\nBorder Collies great companions for a day out as well, so consider them excellent tag-alongs for all your outdoor adventures.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Border Collie loves wide-open countryside spaces, but they happily adapt to the suburbs if there’s space for them to run and walk. They just want to be your bud, so they’re happy to hang with you 24/7. Heading to the office? They’d love to join. Running errands? They’re already in the car.  \n\nBorder Collies thrive in homes where they understand their place in the pack. They do well in dog-only homes with a yard, providing them plenty of room to run and play. Many would also love to be the only pup in your life.  \n\nIf you have kids in your home, your Border Collie will likely embrace them as well. Just be sure to teach children how to interact with dogs in general (and not invade their space), and properly train and socialize your pup.",
  "health_description": "A Border Collie lifespan is 12–15 years. They’re prone to some health issues, so keep an eye out and let your vet know of any problems.  \r\n\n\t• Collapsing after exercise: Border Collie collapse (BCC) happens when an otherwise healthy Border Collie becomes dazed or disoriented during or after intense exercise. A Border Collie may seem uncoordinated or confused for five to 20 minutes or so. It’s unclear why this happens, although genetics may be a factor.  \nDeafness: Congenital deafness has been noted in Border Collies. While the specific genetic defects have not been identified, the risk may be higher in merle color patterns, Border Collies with mostly white heads, and those with two blue eyes.  \nEpilepsy: Seizures in dogs with epilepsy usually begin between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, and they may range from mild to severe. Treatment is usually daily meds.  \nEye issues: Border collies are prone to two potential genetic eye conditions: collie eye anomaly (CEA) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). There are genetic screening tests for both conditions, but neither has a cure. But blind dogs or those with limited vision can do very well and have good quality lives.    \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs when the ball and socket of the hip and thigh bones doesn’t properly fit; it can be an inherited condition. It often results in pain, limping, and arthritis. Treatment options include weight management, physical therapy, joint supplements, pain medication, and, in severe cases, surgery.  \nMultidrug resistance mutation (MDR1): MDR1 is a genetic condition that makes dogs more prone to serious side effects of certain medications. A genetic screening test exists, and you should discuss the right choice for medication with your vet.      \nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CL): CL is a genetic disorder that causes neurologic symptoms such as tremors, seizures, blindness, and shortened lifespan. Genetic screening testing is available, and breeding dogs should be tested.  \nTrapped neutrophil syndrome (TNS): TNS is a genetic condition that compromises a Border Collie’s immune system and can lead to severe infections. This condition is not curable and is, unfortunately, fatal.",
  "history_description": "Amidst picturesque landscapes on the border between England and Scotland, a remarkable breed of sheepdog emerged: the Border Collie. Rooted in Scottish heritage, the word “Collie” was used to describe working dogs, such as herders. In the mid-19th century, Queen Victoria raised several of these energetic dogs, which helped distinguish the Border Collie breed as we know it today from the Collie dog of older times. \n\nTheir heritage as a sheep dog is never far beneath the surface: You know a Border Collie by their live-to-work mentality and for “the stare”—the piercing gaze they give sheep (or whatever modern-day thing they feel like herding) to get in line. In 1995, the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Border Collie as its own breed. \n\nToday, Border Collies hold a special place in the zeitgeist: They star in dog sports such as sheepdog trials (as exemplified in the movie “Babe”) and hold many Guinness World Records, both serious and silly (a notable one is “the fastest time a dog has unwound a nonelectric car window”). Chaser, known as the World’s Smartest Dog, was a Border Collie who understood more than 1,000 words. \n\nThinking of bringing a Border Collie puppy or adult dog home? Reach out to Border Collie rescue organizations, keep an eye out at your local animal shelter for Border Collie rescue dogs, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
