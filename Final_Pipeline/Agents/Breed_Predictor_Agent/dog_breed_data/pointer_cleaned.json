  "breed_intro": "Whether you're a runner or a hunter, the Pointer would like to join in on all the fun you're having, please and thank you. If you're looking for a companion to adventure with you like there's no tomorrow, a Pointer is Here. For. It. They might even invite a stranger or two to join you (these social butterflies live by the adage of the more the merrier!). And if you enjoy a good debate, Pointers, also known as English Pointers, are ready to share their opinions—maybe not vocally, but they sometimes can't help but follow their nose in the opposite direction of where you were headed. And hey, you never know what new, fun experience you'll encounter! Either way, it's an adventure you and your new Pointer BFF will have together.",
  "appearance_description": "The Pointer dog breed is the embodiment of power and grace. Pointers carry themselves proudly with their nose in the air and alert, inquisitive eyes, always attentive to their surroundings (sometimes to a fault). A medium-sized dog with a short-haired coat of many color options, Pointers can be black, liver (brown), lemon or orange, and any of these colors can be combined with white.",
  "temperament_description": "If you're the type of traveler who loves an all-night party in Ibiza, chances are you and a Pointer will get along famously. While they might not share your concerns about the best party clothes to wear (just a simple collar will do for them, thanks), Pointer dogs do share your love for adventure and boundless energy. Intelligent and fun-loving, Pointers are confident, don't take things personally (they're OK that you think their dance moves might need some work), and enjoy the company of both people, including kids and babies and other dogs.\n\nPointers are not usually fearful or anxious in nature, so aggression and dog bites are typically uncommon as they are very friendly dogs—especially with proper training and socialization. And if your kiddos are driving you bananas and making you fantasize about your party days, scoot them outside with your Pointer—kids and doggo can wear each other out playing chase in the backyard, giving you some mental space to dream about booking a trip overseas.\n\nPointers can indeed live with cats, but they must be trained and socialized with cats or small critters starting at an early age to contend with their high prey drive. Pointers are hard workers who work through challenges and don't give up on things easily, but sometimes what they work hard at is what they find to be most important in that moment, whether it's chasing a squirrel, pulling you down the street or jumping to greet people at the door. Pointers were originally bred to point out prey (usually hares) for the hounds to chase down and retrieve. Even if they don't find themselves with a hunting family, they need to work by using their nose, whether that's through lots of exercise, nose work or other games.",
  "care_description": "If you'd rather spend time playing than primping, you and the Pointer have something in common. Pointers have minimal grooming needs compared to other breeds. What's more important is that Pointers have time and space to burn off their high energy running around or sniffing all the scents.",
  "grooming_description": "Less time grooming means more time playing! Here are some grooming tips for your Pointer:\n\n \t• Brushing: Because their short, flat coat sheds moderately, a short quick brushing once a week with a bristle brush will do the trick.\nBathing: Bath time is even easier. Pointers have water-resistant coats and should only be bathed two to three times per year. (Make sure you choose a dog shampoo that won't dry out their coat or skin, and consider using a dog-friendly conditioner.)\nEar cleaning: An English Pointer's longish floppy ears do come with the potential for ear snags or ear infections. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nNail trimming: Keep an eye on your dog's nails. If they get close to touching the floor, it's time for a trim! This may be needed every two weeks or every four weeks. (Get the how-to here.)\nDental care: Lastly, it's recommended to brush your Pointer's teeth daily to stop plaque and tartar from building up. Periodontal disease can lead to a loss of teeth and even more serious issues like organ failure. In addition to regular daily or weekly brushings at home, be sure to take your dog to the vet for professional dental cleanings once per year.",
  "training_description": "Unlike a toddler who can't quite reach the cookie jar, Pointers are unfazed by challenges and hard work. Training your Pointer puppy can start as early as 8-10 weeks to ensure there is a working and highly communicative relationship between pet parent and pup. During puppyhood and into adolescence, Pointers will be driven to follow their instincts and prey drive. They love to work and are quite intelligent, so whether it's walking nicely on a leash, sniffing out a treat, or pointing and retrieving, Pointers are innately more interested in the outside environment, and pet parents can use that to their advantage when it comes to training!\n\nPointers require a training methodology that does not include fear, pain or intimidation as it can absolutely put a wedge in the relationship with this breed, or worse, can create anxiety when it comes to working with you. Not only does this make training even more difficult, it can create a dog who is reactive and/or nervous. Positive reinforcement training that rewards the dog with treats, toy time and/or praise is necessary for your Pointer to learn and become a well-mannered pup.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A Pointer typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\n\nBecause Pointers are so active and always on the go, they may benefit from a high-protein dog food, but consult with your veterinarian, as they will be in the best position to help you pick the best food for your dog based on their individual needs.\n\nLet's talk treats! You're likely be using yummy treats for training as rewards and whenever your pup is being an especially good boy or girl. There are many commercially available dog treats to choose from, some of which are made specifically for training. Table scraps can be high in calories and lead to obesity, so it's best to limit human food as much as possible. (Also, some human foods are dangerous to dogs!) But remember, all treats also count toward your dog's daily caloric intake. Your vet can help you determine the best balance between treats and meals to keep your Pointer at a healthy weight.",
  "exercise_description": "When it comes to exercise, Pointers have a very high energy level and do best with active pet parents. These dogs were bred for hunting and have the speed to go with that skill. So, Pointers are at their best with at least two hours of exercise per day, and they love all kinds of activities like walking, running, swimming and general adventuring. While a rural or suburban setting with a yard is ideal, they can handle city life as long as you can put in the effort to meet their exercise needs. Without an outlet for all their energy, pet parents might see some unwanted behaviors crop up, like chewing or excessive barking.\n\nYou might think all work and no play makes your Pointer a dull dog, but work is a serious topic for the Pointer dog breed. They're fairly laidback, full of love and wet kisses, but they're all about work, even if it's fun work nose work training or a puzzle toy. Games like hide-n-seek or \"Find It\" can be a fun way to stimulate their minds and burn off some energy. Their favorite work is also what they were bred for; dog sports like pointing and retrieving are good options. Maybe there are no spare ducks quacking around, but who's to say they can't point and retrieve a cold bevvie from the fridge for you?",
  "ideal_environment": "Pointers are friendly dogs and don't mind socializing with everyone and their dog. They love kids and other pets (even cats when properly socialized at a young age!). They thrive in environments where they can properly exercise their bodies and minds, whether that's in the city or the country, though they do best in suburban and rural areas where they can easily access an outlet for their high-energy bodies and distractible minds. While they might be a bit much for first-time pet parents, Pointers can be wonderful pets for anyone willing to put in the time and energy.",
  "health_description": "Pointers are generally healthy dogs and have a life expectancy of 12-17 years, but pup parents need to be aware of some of their common health problems so they can help their dog live the healthiest life possible.  \r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: This genetic disorder occurs when the ball and socket joint does not fit together and dislocates or rubs together. Over time, the joint deteriorates. Some dogs start to show signs of hip dysplasia as young as 4 months of age, while others develop it with osteoarthritis as they get older. A radiograph, or X-ray, from the vet will confirm the diagnosis; and treatment can include physical therapy, weight reduction or exercise, medication and sometimes surgery depending on the severity. \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: This endocrine condition is caused by the thyroid gland not producing enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms often include lethargy, weight gain and hair loss. Diagnosis is typically with a blood test and treatment. \r\n \t• Bloat: Bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus, or GDV) is common in larger dogs with wide chests and is a life-threatening, emergency condition. It occurs when a dog’s stomach fills with gas, food or fluid. The stomach then twists and flips, cutting off blood flow to organs. Symptoms often include abdominal distension, retching/dry heaving and restlessness. If you notice these signs, please see a vet immediately. Emergency surgery is typically needed. \r\n \t• Cataracts: A common cause of blindness in older Pointers, cataracts cloud the dog’s vision. Some dogs adjust and live with the loss of vision while surgery to remove the cataracts may be an option. \r\n \t• Deafness: Deafness can be hereditary in Pointers. Genetic screening testing is not available, but affected dogs should not be bred. Dogs with hearing impairments can do well and live full and happy lives.",
  "history_description": "The first Pointers appeared in England around 1650, hunting hares in tandem with Greyhounds. The Pointer found and pointed at the prey, then the hounds chased it down. With the rise of wing shooting in the 18th century, they became trained as bird dogs. Their hunting instincts tend to kick in around two months of age.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that Pointers are a very distractible dog, which doesn't sound ideal for their purpose. But that's actually what makes them amazing hunting dogs—they give up a smell to follow movement, then pick up that same smell until they find their target and point it out.\r\n\r\nPointers were one of the first breeds registered in America in 1878. When the American Kennel Club was founded in 1884, Pointers were one of the first nine breeds to be recognized by the organization.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Pointer puppy as a pet to your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. It's recommended to work with a reputable breeder because that usually means you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health issues and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Pointer price can range $700-$1,000. Prospective pet parents can also adopt from Pointer rescue groups around the country, or you can keep your eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
