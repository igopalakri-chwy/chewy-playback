  "breed_intro": "Everyone loves the idea of hobnobbing with royalty, but if your invite to the ball gets lost in the mail, choose an even better option and adopt a Pug. These dogs have spent thousands of years as royal besties, from China, Holland, and beyond—yet they’ve also maintained their sweet, humble spirit and happy-go-lucky demeanor. Best of all, they’re equally content whether you live in an apartment or reign in a castle (tiara optional).",
  "appearance_description": "Known as a brachycephalic breed (the technical term for flat-faced dogs), Pugs have a square body and a round head with a flat, wrinkled face. Their head is pretty big compared to the rest of their body, which has a short back and strong little legs. A slight underbite and curled tail add to their charm.",
  "temperament_description": "Pugs are incredibly friendly dogs. They thrive on attention and get excited if fun things are happening. These amiable little dogs want to participate in your activities, too, so keep in mind that you’ll need to include them (after all, royalty does not like to feel left out).  \n\nPugs do well with kids and babies and make excellent family dogs. These fun pups love playtime and will likely get along with everyone, including other pets.   \n\nHowever, the Pug’s extra-large eyes are easily injured, so children need to learn early on that their pet’s face is vulnerable and take care while playing. Other pets should be calm enough that they don’t overwhelm your happy little Pug.   \n\nThese smart little dogs might bark, but not a lot—in fact, the most noise they make will likely come from their snorting and snoring. Pugs are affectionate, fun dogs who make delightful best friends for new (or experienced) pet parents.",
  "care_description": "Pugs are easy to care for. They’re smart and quick to learn, so training is enjoyable for everyone. Grooming is fairly simple, and they don’t require a ton of exercise. With a Pug, you’ll need to focus most on preventive care.",
  "grooming_description": "Pugs shed year-round, so this isn’t the breed for you if you can absolutely not handle dog fur on your clothes. Other than dealing with shedding, grooming is a cinch.  \r\n\n\t• Bathing: A bath every month is a good idea (be sure to completely dry all those skin folds!). In between baths, you’ll need to clean a Pug’s wrinkles every day with mild wipes. This removes dander, yeast, bacteria, and other accumulations, helping prevent irritation and skin infections.  \nBrushing: Daily brushing is ideal, and a FURminator brush is an excellent tool to get a Pug’s undercoat out and reduce shedding.  \nDental care: Pugs’ teeth are a bit cramped in their lower jaw, so regular dental care is necessary to prevent serious issues. Start brushing their teeth while they’re young to get them used to the lifelong routine. Ask your vet for advice about dental chews, and have a professional clean your dog’s teeth under anesthesia yearly.  \nEar care: Check their ears for debris every day. If there’s redness, swelling, or an odor, your pup may have an ear infection that needs vet attention. Talk to your veterinarian about how to clean your dog’s ears if they’re prone to infections.  \nNail care: Pugs need their nails trimmed every two to three weeks. If nails get too long, it can make it painful to walk. You’ll know it’s time for a trim when you can hear their nails tapping on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "Eternal optimists, Pugs are clever, food-motivated, and want to do a good job and make you proud. These qualities make them easy to train.  \n\nStart with some basic obedience training—like sit, stay, and come—when your dog is still a young puppy (or as soon as possible if you adopt them when they’re already full-grown).  \n\nDon’t forget socialization, too. It’s important to introduce your pup to new people and places so they’re used to novel interactions and become a well-mannered adult.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Pug, but every dog needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Choose a diet for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior) that’s specifically formulated for small breeds. Some brands, like Royal Canin, even make dog food just for Pug puppies and adults. \n\nPugs have tremendous appetites, so you’ll need to watch their diet to make sure they’re getting appropriate nutrition without overeating. Obesity will lead to other health problems down the road, and it’s best to head them off before they start.  \n\nDog treats are important for motivating your Pug during training, but remember to count these calories, too. Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.  \n\nIf your Pug does need to shed a few pounds (or if you just need advice about how much to feed your dog), ask your vet for advice.",
  "exercise_description": "All dogs need exercise, Pugs included. But it’s important to put some guardrails in place for this special breed. \n\nPugs have a flat face, a shortened snout, and tiny nostrils because of the way they’re bred. This can unfortunately lead to breathing troubles, especially when exercising, excited, or in extreme heat and humidity. \n\nAim for shorter exercise sessions, broken up throughout the day. Pug dogs have pretty low energy levels to begin with, so their exercise needs are also fairly low. They typically need less than an hour of exercise each day. \n\nWhile some Pugs do enjoy dog sports like agility trials, most Pugs will revel in a short walk or indoor playtime. A Pug’s speed is only about 5 to 10 mph, so they’re more likely to enjoy more low-key games, like playing fetch with you. \n\nAvoid exercising your dog in heat and humidity, and be mindful of situations where your Pug might get overexcited, as they tend to overheat quickly.",
  "ideal_environment": "Pugs can adapt to many types of homes and will be happy wherever you live. Apartments? No problem. Small homes? Check. Country cabins? Yep. Big homes with room to meet their royal tastes? You bet!  \n\nPugs are good with children because they’re friendly, have fairly low energy levels, and love to play (even if only for a short time). They’re also a fine choice if you often throw get-togethers at your place, as most Pugs are delighted to greet (and charm) new people.  \n\nYour Pug doesn’t need a big backyard or adjacent park to be happy—though they’d love to feel some grass under their feet at least some of the time, especially if you live in a city. You could try a nearby dog park to see if they enjoy meeting new friends. Make sure they’re up to date on vaccines and routine vet visits if they’re going to be around a lot of new friends at the park.   \n\nThese pups don’t love extreme temperatures, so limit their time outdoors if it’s super hot or cold. However, Pugs really do love being indoors and don’t need a ton of space, as long as you’re there too. Lucky you—you are the Pug’s ideal environment!",
  "health_description": "Small dog breeds tend to have longer lifespans than large dog breeds, and the Pug is no exception. The average Pug life expectancy is 13–15 years. However, there are a few health issues you should be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Allergies: Some pugs have sensitive skin and can be affected by allergies. Allergies can be caused by food or (more commonly) environmental factors like pollen, grass, and mold. Signs may be itchiness, a rash, or redness.  \nBrachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome: Also known as BOAS, this condition is caused by a Pug’s facial anatomy and makes breathing difficult, even during rest. Manage symptoms by keeping your dog at a healthy weight and avoiding extreme temperatures. Severe cases require surgery.   \nEar infections: Those floppy ears are cute, but they may harbor infections. Check your Pug’s ears every day and gently wipe away any debris with a vet-approved ear cleaner. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, or a bad odor. Ear infections can be a manifestation of allergies, too.   \nEye issues: Because Pugs have such prominent eyes and a smooshed face, they are more prone to eye problems. Examine your Pug’s eyes for signs of redness, discharge, squinting, or cloudiness, and call your vet if you see anything unusual.  \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia develops during puppyhood when the hip joint doesn’t align well and becomes looser than normal. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or, in severe cases, surgery. \nLuxating patella: Pugs can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. You might notice that they do a little bunny hop or skip—this could be a symptom. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be necessary. \nPug dog encephalitis (PDE): PDE is an inflammatory brain disease affecting approximately 1.5% of Pugs; it is, unfortunately, fatal. Within a matter of weeks, a dog will experience seizures, circling, blindness, and then a coma. There is no known treatment for the disease, and it’s unclear what causes it. \nSkin issues: Keep your Pug clean and dry to minimize skin problems. Skin folds require special attention to avoid irritation and infections. Clean your Pug’s facial wrinkles as well as the area around the private parts with mild wipes; it’ll help prevent odor and other issues. Skin infections can be a sign of allergies as well.",
  "history_description": "Pugs started out as the beloved companions of Chinese emperors. Royalty held them in high esteem for decades—some Pugs even had their own guards!  \n\nBy the 1500s, Pugs had begun to travel abroad. They eventually arrived in Europe, where they became popular with royalty in Holland. In France, Napoleon’s wife, Josephine, had a Pug. In England, Queen Victoria was said to be especially fond of the breed; she shared her home with as many as 38 Pugs.   \n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885, and the Pug Dog Club of America was established in 1931.  \n\nIf you’re thinking about bringing home your own Pug, keep in mind that they’re knowingly bred with a health issue (BOAS) and be prepared for any vet bills that pop up down the road. Work with a reputable breeder who prioritizes the health of their pups.  \n\nYou can also adopt a Pug by reaching out to a nearby Pug rescue (like Appalachian Pug Rescue or Mid-Atlantic Pug Rescue). Keep an eye out for the breed at your local shelter or animal rescue organization, too, and check available dogs via Chewy’s database of adoptable pets in your area.",
