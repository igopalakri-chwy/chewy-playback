  "breed_intro": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has never met a stranger. Expect to make a new friend everywhere you go with this bubbly, happy-go-lucky pup by your side. Gentle and patient, Cavaliers don't really have an agenda for the day. The only thing on their to-do list is \"hang out with you.\" Their adaptability to new situations makes them great company for whatever you have planned. So, whether you're running errands, lounging on the couch or having friends over for game night, your Cavalier will be happy to tag along.",
  "appearance_description": "Cavalier King Charles Spaniels' big, brown eyes are the window into their sweet souls. They prance around gleefully with their signature floppy ears hanging playfully, and their tails wagging merrily, always ready to tag along wherever you may go. Their beautiful, medium-length coats come in four color patterns: black and tan, tricolor (black, tan and white), Blenheim (chestnut and white) and ruby.",
  "temperament_description": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a sweet and gentle toy dog breed with no shortage of playfulness to share with the whole family. They're adaptable and easy-going, ready for everyday adventures or spending quality time relaxing at home. Cavaliers are known to mirror their pet parents; they easily adapt to fit your lifestyle, whether you're super active or more low-key.\n\nTheir love language is giving and receiving affection; these little dogs will boost your mood and shower you with love. True social butterflies, Cavaliers enjoy most social settings, and take pride in getting to know every human they may encounter. And because of their big hearts and good nature, they can also be effective therapy dogs.\n\nWith their cheerful demeanor, it's no surprise that Cavaliers get along well with people and other animals—including cats. Because they're a small breed, they may be a little timid around larger dogs at first. So, don't put too much pressure on them to play with the \"big boys\" until your Cavalier feels comfortable doing so.\n\nIf you're not up for making new friends, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy may not be the dog for you. Their over-the-top friendliness is best for folks looking for a way to meet new people. After all, with their fun-loving attitude and zest for life, they're likely to get you striking up conversations with new friends everywhere you go.",
  "care_description": "Much like their relaxed, go-with-the-flow personality, Cavaliers are pretty low maintenance when it comes to grooming, even though their coat isn't short. With occasional brushing and bathing, their signature coat can stay shiny and healthy year-round. Because they enjoy cuddles and being lap dogs so much, you can easily make groom-time an experience that strengthens the bond you have with your Cavalier.",
  "grooming_description": "Although Cavalier King Charles Spaniels require regular grooming, including bathing and brushing, you can manage most of it at home. Here are grooming tips for your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel:\r\n\n\t• Brushing: You'll need to brush their fur every day to keep knots untangled. Their fur—especially on their ears—can get matted, so use a slicker brush, like the Safari Flexible Slicker Dog Brush, to keep them mat-free. It can also detangle mats while reducing shedding when used all over their body. While beautiful, Cavaliers' silky coats sometimes get smelly because they trap dirt and bacteria, making regular brushing that much more important. Contact your vet if your pup does have an odor that's not resolved with brushing or bathing; they may have an ear infection or a problem with bad breath.\nBathing: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs need a bath about once a month to keep their coat shiny and healthy.\nNail trimming: After their bath is the perfect opportunity to give their nails a trim. (The bath softens up their nails and makes the whole process easier.) You'll know they're ready for a trim when you hear your pup coming by the click-clacking on hard surfaces in your home.\nHaircuts: There are two basic types of haircuts: the natural cut and the puppy cut.\r\n\n\t• Natural cut: The natural cut leaves the fur long and is only trimmed at the bottom of their coat and between the toes. You can trim the fur between the toes with round-tip safety scissors, like the Pet Magasin Grooming Scissors, so you don't accidentally cut your pup's skin.\nPuppy cut: With the puppy cut, the fur is kept to 1-2 inches long (except those ears!) and is great if you want a more low-maintenance pup.\r\n\nTeeth brushing: Brushing your pup's teeth daily can help keep their teeth and gums healthy and avoid tartar buildup, which could lead to periodontal disease. Once a year, schedule a professional teeth cleaning with your vet.\nEar cleaning: Don't forget to check their ears. If you notice debris, redness or swelling, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, check out our vet-approved guide for cleaning a dog's ears.\nFull-body check: Cavaliers like to be pampered every now and then (don't we all?), especially with a full-body massage. Use this time to look for new bumps, skin issues (lesions, etc.) and bugs (fleas, ticks). If you notice anything unusual, contact your vet.",
  "training_description": "Begin training classes and socializing your puppy early on to help them learn proper manners around others. (Consider it cotillion for your extroverted pup.) Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies are smart and easy to train. They respond wonderfully to reward-based training, so you want to have yummy—and healthy!—treats to reward them, like Crumps' Naturals Mini Trainers. They also enjoy fun, small and squeaky toys that play to their hunting instincts, like the plush KONG Cozie Marvin the Moose + Cozie Baily the Blue dog toys. Both treats and toys are tools that will encourage your pup to respond positively to different training commands. As true companion pups, Cavaliers always aspire to please their pet parents and will generally pick up various commands and tricks with ease.\n\nAlthough Cavaliers are mostly relaxed and incredibly friendly with just about anyone they meet, they do have a \"teenager\" phase. When they hit puberty at around 6-8 months old, they become more distant and timid around people. If you notice this change, don't push them to socialize—you may end up reinforcing this unwanted behavior. Temporarily adjust walks, so you have more alone time. Then, plan walks where people your pup knows well cross your path; chat for a bit, but don't interact with your pup. (Your friend should drop a tasty treat.) Over time, your Cavalier should respond to your friends positively and take a treat from their hand. Eventually, your Cavalier will return to their playful ways.\n\nBecause they're smart and savvy, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels do well in canine sports, such as obedience, rally and agility. These sports are a great way to combine training with exercise. (It's a two-fer!)",
  "diet_nutrition": "Generally, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels should eat high-quality food specifically designed for the life stage they're currently in, whether puppy, adult or senior—age is a key factor in determining diet. Look on the package for a statement that says the food meets standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) to ensure it's nutritionally balanced.\n\nBecause they are prone to digestive disorders, Cavaliers may benefit from food with limited ingredients. Fresh food, raw food and freeze-dried options, like Stella & Chewy's Dinner Patties, can be great choices for your pup. Before switching your dog's diet, check with your vet to ensure your dog gets the proper nutrition they need.\n\nToo much of a good thing is still too much, so keep an eye on your Cavalier's weight. Follow the recommended portions to help make sure you don't feed your pup too much. If your pup has added a few extra pounds, your vet can help you put together a meal plan and exercise regimen that provides the nutrients your dog needs and helps them lose the extra weight.\n\nWhile treats are a good way to reward your pup in training or for being a very good pup, remember to do so in moderation. (Treat calories count!) And no matter how cute their sad puppy dog eyes look, don't give your pup table scraps. If you want to reward your pup with human-safe food, frozen blueberries or green beans (not canned) may be a good option.",
  "exercise_description": "Compared to other breeds, Cavaliers have a moderate energy level and minimal exercise needs. One or two 20- to 30-minute walks a day with playtime and obedience training is sufficient (about one hour total). The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel descends from sporting dogs (dogs bred to hunt), so they do enjoy outside activities. (They love to snuggle, but they are not couch potatoes!) They love taking long walks with their family (they are not known for their speed), and do well in canine sports, such as obedience, rally and agility.\n\nWhen you're on a walk or at the park, keep your dog on the leash at all times. If something catches their attention, they could run off and not return when called. (Their hunting and scenting instincts run deep.) Consider using a harness, like the Puppia vest step-in dog harness because it's easy to put on and take off. A harness not only reduces the chance your pup will slip out of their collar and run off, but also protects their neck from pulling or straining on the leash.",
  "ideal_environment": "Cavaliers are extremely adaptable. Because they love being so close to their families, they thrive in all sorts of settings, from small apartments to large houses. If you have a home, a fenced yard is recommended, so your dog doesn't run off when they see—or smell!—something interesting. However, if you have an affinity for the Great Outdoors, they're probably more suited to spend time in an RV than a tent. (They are totally up for glamping, though!) Grab a cozy dog bed for them, like the Original Calming shag fur donut cuddler, and they'll be more than ready to snuggle up no matter where you are.\n\nA Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is truly a breed for anyone, whether you are single or have a family with kids and babies. If you're the outgoing type who keeps a packed calendar and wants a constant companion, Cavaliers are happy to tag long. But if you're a couch potato who prefers to stay at home and catch up on your streaming queue, they'll happily snuggle next to you and be thrilled with whatever show you choose. (Just make sure they still get their daily exercise!)",
  "health_description": "Even though they have a lifespan of 12-15 years, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are prone to a number of health issues, especially as they age. But that shouldn’t stop you from bringing one of these lovable pups into your life. It’s important to be aware of these issues up front so you can help your pup live a long, happy life. \r\n\n\t• Mitral Valve Disease: This is a condition that occurs when the mitral valve of the heart deteriorates, causing the heart to work less efficiently when it pumps blood. In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, this disease often leads to congestive heart failure. Vets perform several tests that examine different aspects of the heart to catch any issues early on. Surgery is not usually an option, but drugs and treatments help improve heart function. Mitral valve disease may be inherited, so affected dogs should not be used for breeding purposes. \r\n\t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition where the femur doesn’t fit correctly in the hip socket. It can lead to early signs of arthritis, including limping or general pain when walking. Because they are a smaller breed, Cavaliers may not show symptoms until they’re older. Depending on the severity, treatments can include changes in diet and exercise, weight management, medications, physical therapy or even surgery. \r\n\t• Syringomyelia: This is a term used to describe fluid-filled cavities (called syrinx) that develop in the spinal cord. This is caused by an underlying Chiari-like malformation, when a dog’s brain is too big for the space inside their skull. Withdrawn behavior, vocalizing when running or jumping, discomfort when being picked up and scratching of the shoulder, neck and ear area are common symptoms—due to altered sensation and eventual pain. Treatment focuses mainly on pain management, as surgery is often not a viable option. \r\n\t• Ear Infections: Inflammation of the ear canal (Otitis externa) can be common in Cavaliers. Their long, drooping ears are likely a contributing factor to this problem, but the exact cause is unknown. Often, dogs with otitis issues are found to have underlying allergy problems. Anti-inflammatory medications, frequently combined with topical antibiotics or antifungal compounds may help provide relief and reduce the inflammatory effects. In more severe cases, surgery may be needed. \r\n\t• Eye Problems: Cavaliers are prone to a few eye diseases. Cataracts can cause blindness and may be corrected through surgery, depending on the dog’s age and health. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) also leads to blindness, but there is currently no treatment available. Dogs with cataracts or PRA often adjust well to the loss of eyesight. Cavaliers may also suffer from an inherited condition called dry eye. Here, the dog cannot produce tears to keep the eye moist, which can lead to corneal inflammation, ulceration or pigmentation. Early diagnosis is important to protect the eye. Treatments may include antibiotics or anti-inflammatories, and daily ointments to help produce and replace tears are often prescribed. \r\n\t• Luxating patella: Luxating patella (kneecap) is a condition that occurs when the groove that holds the patella in position is too shallow, allowing the patella to escape its normal position when the knee joint bends and straightens. This condition is seen more commonly in smaller breeds and does not always cause discomfort, but it can lead to other painful problems, like torn cruciate ligaments, arthritis and more.",
  "history_description": "With a name as regal as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel's, it's not the least bit surprising the breed has a royal history. They're named after King Charles I, a 17th-century British monarch who evidently had several toy spaniels who accompanied him almost everywhere. He and his son, Charles II, had black and tan varieties, which have been around since at least the Renaissance times in Europe. Originally bred to be a bird hunter, their small, short stature and demeanor made them better suited to be companions and affectionate lap dogs.\n\nCavaliers were extremely popular among the noble classes and remained a go-to breed for aristocrats in the United Kingdom until the early 19th century. The Marlborough family was very involved with breeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace, turning their focus on the chestnut and white variety. During Queen Victoria's reign, the breed was mixed with Asian toy breeds, such as Pugs and Japanese Chins. This cross-breeding changed the breed's look and structure, evolving into a shape with a domed skull and flatter face than the dogs Charles I had. In fact, Charles' dogs came close to extinction as this new variety dominated.\n\nIn the 1920s, people wanted the dogs portrayed in the old portraits of their ancestors. Roswell Eldridge, a wealthy American, challenged British breeders to breed Blenheim Spaniels \"of the Old World type.\" To win a cash prize, the breeders worked to bring back the old look—and they did. That's when the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was born. Where did the \"cavalier\" come from? The army that supported Charles I in the English Civil War was called Cavaliers, and thus we get \"Cavalier\" in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\n\nThe Cavalier became an American Kennel Club-recognized breed in 1995 and is the 14th most popular breed in America. It's no wonder why—Cavaliers are highly prized for their affectionate and adaptable temperament. (And they're so darn cute!) If you're looking to add a Cavalier as a pet, you can find reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. A Cavalier puppy can cost between $1,800-$3,500. But for that price, you usually get a pup who's been screened for health issues and may include pedigree papers. Or, you can check with local Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rescue organizations, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are Cavalier King Charles Spaniels hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are not hypoallergenic. Although they're average shedders, they tend to leave fur behind on clothing and furniture. If you need a dog who won't ignite your allergies, but you love the Cavalier, look at popular mixes such as the Cavapoo (Cavalier-Poodle mix) or the Cavachon (Cavalier-Bichon Frise mix). If the dog's fur is more like the Poodle's or Bichon's, they could be better for allergy sufferers than a purebred Cavalier King Charles Spaniel."
