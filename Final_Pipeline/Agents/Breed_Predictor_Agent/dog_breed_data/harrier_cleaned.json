  "breed_intro": "Harriers love only one thing more than the outdoors: their people. From hiking to jogging to playing in the backyard, a Harrier pup loves an adventure. And if it's a group adventure, even better. These dogs were born to work in teams, and they get very lonely all by themselves. But if your energy levels match theirs, you'll find plenty of ways to keep them engaged and entertained. Harriers live for a challenge, whether it's tracking down that treat stash you hid in the backyard or winning a local agility trial. Larger than a Beagle and smaller than an American Fox Hound, the Harrier could be just right for you—if you can keep up.",
  "appearance_description": "The Harrier might appear serious and stately, but don't let them fool you—this is a fun, adventurous breed. They're always sniffing out the next activity with their nose to the ground and their tail in the air. Their coats come in several color combos, but tri-color (black, white and tan) is most common. Their expressions look earnest and deceptively languid.",
  "temperament_description": "Lace up your sneakers because you've just met your new running buddy. This dog is ready to mix and mingle like it's a 26.2-mile race day every day. And make sure you keep up the pace because the Harrier can get a bit stir-crazy and destructive if they don't exercise enough.\r\n\r\nThis hunting breed loves family life, and entertaining at home is their favorite. While the Harrier is friendly and totally welcomes a crowd— adults, dogs, older kids—they may be a little stand-offish with strangers. You'll want to supervise playtimes with very young kids because Harriers may knock small kids over in their rambunctious play, and be sure to teach any little ones around your pet how to respectfully interact with dogs. Start socialization while your pup is young to help them get used to being around new people. Watch out for any creature that could be mistaken for prey, including bunnies, cats and hamsters—the Harrier's next chase is never too far away.\r\n\r\nHarriers aren't particularly clingy, but they're pack dogs, which means they're bred to work as a team and not by themselves. It's best to be with them most of the day or have another dog at home for them to play with. Give them plenty to keep them occupied, or they might bark, dig, chew things and attempt a jailbreak to alleviate their boredom. Try gifting them chew toys, fetch toys, brain games and maybe even a Jolly Pet ball (they're great for herding types, but some Harriers love 'em, too).\r\n\r\nSince they love to roam (or escape, given half the chance), keep your dog safe by using a leash when not in enclosed spaces and ensuring off-leash areas are really enclosed.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Hound group, the Harrier was originally bred to hunt hares, so they love a heady mix of physical activity, mental stimulation, tracking and running with a pack. This dog is always up for a workout session at the park to find new friends.",
  "care_description": "Overall, the Harrier's maintenance is in the medium range—not too little, not too much. Their grooming needs are low, so a little weekly care goes a long way. Plan to spend extra time on exercise and adventures because this breed needs plenty of physical and mental stimulation.",
  "grooming_description": "Compared to many other dog breeds, grooming your Harrier is pretty straightforward. Their shedding is a seasonal affair (in the spring), but a weekly brushing goes a long way to keep the dead hairs to a minimum and their coat shiny and healthy. Pro tip: Take your pooch to the porch once a week to brush your dog and minimize those flyaway dog hairs in your home. Simply brush off dead hair with a natural bristle brush, a rubber curry comb, or a hound mitt like the Handson Grooming Gloves.\n\nHarriers only need a few baths, perhaps one every three months (unless they've rolled in something unmentionable).\n\nVets can help teach pet parents how to brush their dog's teeth (good dental hygiene is important for any dog). Start brushing their teeth when they're a puppy, and they'll get used to it faster. The typical Harrier's tooth tartar isn't too bad, but it's something to keep an eye on. So brush daily, and make sure you get annual professional teeth cleanings by your vet (not your groomer).\n\nTrim long toenails if they look long, or you can hear them tapping on hard surfaces. Outdoor activities may wear them down naturally, but check them about once a month anyway.\n\nHarriers have drop ears (lowered and tight to the side of the head), putting them at risk for ear infections and yeast buildup. Check your Harrier's ears monthly for redness and swelling, and recheck them whenever you spot your pup rubbing an ear. Consult your vet if you notice anything unusual; they may advise you to clean your dog's ears.",
  "training_description": "Your Harrier needs moderate training to be a well-behaved family member. Like all dogs, they thrive on friendly, calm, positive reinforcement techniques. Use a lot of praise, treats and playtimes with special toys to reward them when they do a good job.\n\nTeach them the basics, like sit, stay and come, and how to walk nicely on a leash. Harriers are hunters and have great instincts; their nose leads them. You may work on the same command for longer than expected because they get distracted. That's OK. Be patient, and you'll be rewarded. Keep training sessions short, and remember to take breaks before either of you get frustrated. Harriers are intelligent, and they will eventually pick it up. Remember, while you won't be able to train their instincts to bark and chase completely away, you can help curb those behaviors.\n\nSocialize your dog starting when they're a puppy. Even though these dogs are very friendly, getting them used to meeting new people and other dogs while they're young is vital to help bring out their outgoing personalities. Take them on lots of leashed walks and let them meet and sniff new friends, both two- and four-legged. Enroll them in puppy school, where they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Harriers do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior), and look for the statement on the package that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nHarriers will eat an entire bowl of any dog food in five minutes and want more, which can lead to obesity and health problems like heart disease and diabetes that come with it. It's essential to have food bowls out only at mealtimes and not allow them to graze all day. Your veterinarian can help you determine how much and how often to feed your Harrier.\r\n\r\nAvoid feeding them table scraps, cooked bones and high-fat foods, as these can lead to obesity and other health problems. Harriers might enjoy chew toys to gnaw on between meals instead. Watch the number of treats you give—those calories count, too! Again, consult with your veterinarian; they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Hey, did we mention the Harrier are active dogs who love exercise? Harriers are hard-working hound dogs, and they're so much fun. But the exercise commitment is quite a bit more extensive than, say, the commitment of a Beagle. This breed has high exercise needs—plan for 60 to 90 minutes daily. Afterward, though, these dogs do settle down well for a little Netflix binge on the couch.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nonstop marathon training, Harriers make great hiking companions and will enjoy long walks where they can explore with their noses (this is a great way to exercise their minds, too). They also like retrieving games, like throwing the ball and letting your dog hunt for it. Mental as well as physical workouts create happy, healthy and well-behaved Harriers.\r\n\r\nDo you like a bit of competition? Your Harrier will, too. These pups excel at dog sports, like agility, tracking and coursing (where they chase a lure around a track). Your pup gets their wiggles out, and you may come home with some snazzy first-place ribbons!\r\n\r\nHarriers have many positive traits, but boredom is definitely something you want to avoid. Harriers will plot mischief or an escape route if they don't get enough mental exercise, so load up on fetch toys or puzzle toys to keep them challenged.\r\n\r\nRemember that Harriers are hunters led by their noses. Your yard must be securely fenced; otherwise, they'll put their nose down and disappear! They can be quite the Houdini when on a scent, so keeping them on a leash when out and about is essential. If they catch a scent, these speedy dogs are off on the chase—and all your training will feel like it's gone out the window. So, for your sanity and their safety, always keep them on a leash when you're out and about.",
  "ideal_environment": "Harriers love to have company, and they're good with families. Because working in teams is in their genes, they do better when they're not alone. So, if it's just you and your Harrier, you may want to add another dog to the home. While they love a social scene, watching Harriers around small children is always a good idea. Be especially careful with small pets that your Harrier might mistake for critters that need chasing, like cats and rodents.\r\n\r\nHarriers thrive in active homes and can really make the most of an expansive, securely fenced-in yard. They may be less suited for apartment living, but if you have regular access to a dog-friendly outdoor area where they can exercise, it can be done. In addition to needing lots of company and room to roam, Harriers can be vocal (and some love to howl). They make great neighbors in suburban homes, and they love the country.",
  "health_description": "Harriers have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years and fewer health issues than other, more common breeds. Nevertheless, it’s good to know potential health problems so you can take the best care of your furry friend and help them live a long and happy life.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia happens when the hip joint is malformed and rubs, causing the dog pain. Treatment options include weight management, physical therapy and, in severe cases, surgery.\nCataracts: Cataracts, a clouding of the eye that can impair a dog’s vision, are often inherited. Fortunately, surgery is typically an option to correct vision issues caused by cataracts.\nPerianal Fistula: This condition causes painful tracts in the skin around the bum. Allergies and hypothyroidism are two of the potential causes of the disease. While not common in Harriers, treatment options might include a change in diet, antibiotics or medication.\nEpilepsy: Epilepsy can have a hereditary component and seizures usually first occur at 6 months to 5 years of age. Treatment is typically daily medication.",
  "history_description": "While there are many unconfirmed tales about the history of this breed, there are a few Harrier dog facts we know for sure. Harriers were initially bred for hunting hares—get it, \"Harrier\"? The first packs appear to have originated in medieval England sometime in the 1200s. Sir Elias de Midhope, a resident of Yorkshire, England, is believed to have developed the first Harrier. His Harrier packs were originally called Penistone Harriers or the Penistone Pack. Detailed records of individual Harrier packs have been recorded in England from 1260 to today.\r\n\r\nHarriers have been in America since colonial times. Some say Virginians, perhaps even George Washington, used Harriers to develop American hounds. They appealed to literary types too, and in 1735, English poet William Somervile published a poem called \"The Chase\" that described a Harrier dog.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Harrier breed in 1885. One of the AKC's rarest breeds, the Harrier is considered rarer than the panda, with only about 949 Harriers registered with the AKC from 1884 to 1994. The good news is that their rareness may promote healthy genetics, which means the Harrier may have fewer health complications than other breeds.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find a Harrier puppy today? You can find a list of reputable Harrier breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. Depending on the breeder, expect the cost of your Harrier puppy to be anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000. You usually get a Harrier screened for health and temperament issues for that price, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Harrier rescue organizations to adopt a Harrier.",
