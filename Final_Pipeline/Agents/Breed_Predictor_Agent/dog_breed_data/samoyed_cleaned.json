  "breed_intro": "If you’ve ever wondered if a tried-and-true mood booster can come in the form of a big, white puff of fluff, cue the Samoyed.   \n\nThese happy-go-lucky pups seem to have a permanent smile, and even their nickname—they’re known as Sammies—has a cheerful glee. If you happen to live in a winter wonderland, this snow-loving adventure dog will adore it. But the easygoing, social Samoyed (pronounced SAH-ma-yed) can adapt in lots of places as long as they have an adoring pet parent.",
  "appearance_description": "This ball of white fluff knows how to turn heads. Samoyeds are elegant, medium-sized dogs who carry themselves with equal parts grace and determination. Their dark eyes sparkle, and they always seem to wear a smile.",
  "temperament_description": "With a smile ready to greet you at a moment’s notice, the Samoyed is an instant pick-me-up. If you’re looking to make friends, your Sammy will make sure you meet everyone on the block. They’re so friendly that they’d invite a complete stranger in for tea and give them a tour of the house; they really do seem to love everyone.  \n\nAlso known as Siberian Samoyeds, these pups are whip-smart and crave attention. They’re not the kind of dog you can leave alone for long periods of time—they’ll simply miss you too much and won’t be able to bear the loneliness (yes, it’s a little dramatic, but that’s how your Sammy sees it).  \n\nIn other words, there’s no need for an electric blanket on cold winter nights—you’re going to have quite the cuddler on your hands. \n\nThese dogs form deep bonds with their humans and are always up for a fun adventure. They do have a mind of their own, though, so obedience training can go a long way toward getting them to come around to your way of thinking.  \n\nThey’re not afraid to bark, but this can also be worked on with a certified trainer who uses positive reinforcement. Samoyed dogs can also be mouthy when they play (it’s instinctual and how they would pal around with other pups), which is something that’s important to nip in the bud at a young age so that no one inadvertently gets hurt, especially kids (who your Samoyed will likely adore).",
  "care_description": "Samoyeds are high-energy dogs with high-maintenance needs—but they’re 100% worth it. You’ll need to pay a lot of attention to their puffy coat, and their independent streak calls for consistent training and lots of exercise time.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Samoyeds don’t need super frequent baths—a about least twice a year is OK, though more frequent bathing may be needed if you’ve got an especially muddy pup.  \r\n\n\t• The best time to bathe your dog is right after you’ve brushed out their wooly undercoat. Always thoroughly dry their coat using a high-velocity, dog-safe blow dryer.  \nIn between baths, keep the coat clean by toweling off your dog when they come inside. If your Samoyed gets frequent tear stains, you can use special wipes.  \r\n\nBrushing: Because of their double coat, Samoyeds look like white balls of fluff. They also shed a ton, especially in the fall and spring.  Brush their coat at least two to three times a week year-round; daily is even better.  \r\n\n\t• Try a long hair de-shedding tool like this one from FURminator and a metal dog comb for removing and preventing mats.  \nNever shave your Samoyed. Their double coat is weather-resistant, protects them from both the heat and cold, and helps them regulate their body temperature. Plus, the fur may not grow back correctly, and a shaved Sammy is susceptible to sunburns and overheating. \r\n\nDental care: Start brushing your Samoyed’s teeth at an early age, working your way up to daily brushing with a dog toothpaste. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year.  \nNail care: Trim their nails every three to four weeks. You’ll know it’s time when you hear them clacking on your tile floors. Also trim the fur between their toes.",
  "training_description": "Because your brilliant Samoyed is independent-minded and a bit mischievous, start their training as early as possible. Teach them cues like sit, stay, and come, as well as how to walk nicely on a leash. These will all help them become a well-behaved member of the family.  \n\nWhen you train them, use positive reinforcement—that is, treats, toys, and praise. Also invest time in proper socialization, which involves exposing your Samoyed puppy to new people, places, and situations in a positive manner. If you’d like some help, a certified trainer who uses positive reinforcement can work with you and your pup. \n\nTraining activities for your Sammy will involve their minds and their noses. Some Samoyeds will enjoy learning tricks or participating in agility training. For extra mental stimulation, they may enjoy scent work.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for your Samoyed, but every pup needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Also choose a formula that’s made for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nYour veterinarian can help determine the best diet and feeding times for your Sammy. This high-energy dog might benefit from a high-protein “sport” formula, like this food from Purina Pro Plan. \n\nDon’t forget to calculate treats into your pup’s daily meal plan—their calories count, too, and should never be more than 10% of your dog’s daily intake.",
  "exercise_description": "Samoyeds are highly active dogs who want to keep up with you. In truth, you’ll probably be the one trying to keep up with them. They need about two hours of exercise a day.   \n\nThis is easier for them to accomplish in cooler climates—they can run for miles, enjoy hikes, and go all day at games of fetch (try the Chuckit! Launcher toy).  \n\nIf it’s warmer out, make sure they have lots of water, shade, and an AC when they get back inside, and choose to go out only earlier and later in the day when it’s cooler. These fluffy pups don’t handle the heat well. \n\nSammies love playing with their family in a fenced yard or going on long walks, too. Their instinct is to run off and explore, so if you’re not in a fenced yard or park, make sure they’re on a leash. \n\nSamoyeds make good running partners—they can reach speeds of over 30 mph on their own, but they’ll go at a more leisurely pace at your side. They’re just happy to be invited along for the ride.",
  "ideal_environment": "While they might be OK in smaller homes or apartments, Samoyeds love the outdoors, so a home with a fenced yard is a dream for these sporty pups. \n\nThese friendly dogs are super social and adventurous, and they’d love it if you are, too. Samoyeds will charm guests as much as they’ll delight their own family every single day.  \n\nSamoyeds may do well with other dogs in the home, especially when they’re a similar size. They may not do as well with smaller animals like cats, since instinct might tell them to chase kitties. However, if you socialize your Samoyed puppy with cats and make introductions correctly, they’ll be more accepting of feline friends. \n\nYounger children and babies might be challenging, since Sammies are so joyful and active that they want everyone to play as much as they do—something that might overwhelm tiny humans. However, Samoyeds are great with older kids. As with all dogs, teach any children how to gently and respectfully play with pups.   \n\nIf you tend to be out of the house a lot, have a plan for your pup. Samoyeds adore attention and they don’t like to be alone for long. Even if you’re around and leave them in the yard alone for too long, they’ll let you know they’re not happy with nuisance behaviors, like digging. Sammies want to play with their favorite person in the world—not by themselves.",
  "health_description": "The Samoyed lifespan is 12–14 years. Here are some health issues to be aware of. \r\n\n\t• Cataracts: Cataracts aren’t usually painful, but they do cause vision loss. Surgery is the go-to treatment.  \nElbow and hip dysplasia: Elbow and hip dysplasia are genetic conditions that develop during puppyhood when the joints don’t align correctly and become loose. Treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or (in severe cases) surgery. \nHeart issues: Samoyeds can inherit a condition called pulmonic stenosis, making it harder for blood to flow from the heart to the lungs. The heart must work overtime to pump enough blood, so your Samoyed could faint or run out of energy in the middle of an activity. An echocardiogram (or ultrasound of the heart) can diagnosis it, and treatment includes medications or surgery. \nHypothyroidism: Common in Samoyeds, hypothyroidism includes symptoms like lethargy, hair loss, skin and ear infections, and weight gain. A blood test can diagnosis it, and treatment is daily oral medication. \nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA leads to blindness in dogs. While there is no cure, pups who lose their eyesight can still live full, happy lives and tend to adapt well.  \nSamoyed hereditary glomerulopathy: This genetic disorder leads to kidney failure. There is no cure, and it affects male dogs more than females. \nUveodermatologic syndrome: Symptoms of this autoimmune disorder include inflammation of the eye and loss of skin pigmentation on the skin. Treatment may include immunosuppressant medications and steroids.",
  "history_description": "With their fluffy, thick coat, it makes sense that Samoyeds have a history tied to cold climates. Their name originates from the Samoyedic, a seminomadic people from Siberia, where temperatures can drop to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  \n\nNot many can endure such harsh conditions, but Samoyeds were originally bred to prosper in this environment—their coat kept them warm and protected them no matter how frigid or windy it might have gotten. The ancestors of today’s Samoyed pulled sleds across the Arctic tundra and served as guardian dogs, as well as hunters and herders at times. (They were reindeer herders at one point.)  \n\nOn very cold nights, these dogs and their people would huddle together to keep warm with their body heat, forming a close bond. This behavior explains why Samoyeds today tend to be especially connected to their pet parents.   \n\nThen, in the late 18th century, Arctic explorers took the Samoyed back to Great Britain, where dog-lovers fell for this clever breed. A royal endorsement was a turning point in the Samoyed’s history: Alexandra of Denmark was enamored with the breed and took one as a companion and show dog. The American Kennel Club registered the first Samoyed in 1906. \n\nSamoyed puppies cost between $1,200–$3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also consider Samoyed adoption, as there are many waiting for forever homes. Look for a Samoyed rescue group near you, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
