  "breed_intro": "The dignified Lhasa Apso may be the perfect lap dog today, but they once marched the halls of palaces and holy places, keeping watch over what happened inside. Lhasas fondly recall how they were respected and adored—they're named for the most sacred city in Tibet, after all. So, naturally, they expect that level of respect from their present-day admirers. But their demands aren't many, just a few treats now and then, a cozy lap to curl up in and their favorite person at their beck and call. It's a rough job being adorable, but Lhasas are more than happy to fulfill the role.",
  "appearance_description": "The Lhasa Apso dog may be small, but they're hard to miss. With their characteristically long hair, button nose and cute underbite, they are often mistaken for stuffed animals. And that feathery tail curled over their back reinforces their playful personalities. This breed has inquisitive eyes and a wide smile that easily wins over strangers (though they may take some time to warm up to new friends).",
  "temperament_description": "The Lhasa Apso breed has a playful personality and often keeps their puppy behaviors longer than other dog breeds. Intelligent and curious, Lhasas have a moderate energy level and don't require a lot of exercise. But they are stubborn, so they need consistent training to keep them well-behaved members of the family. The most important thing to a Lhasa Apso is to be wherever you are; they will suffer from separation anxiety when you're gone for long.\n\nOriginating in Tibet as guard dogs (can you believe it?), these pups mainly apply for \"lap dog\" jobs today. Still, it's important to start socializing your Lhasa Apso puppy and train them early to help them be welcoming to strangers.\n\nLhasa Apsos typically do better with older children but can get along with small children if they grow up together. Be sure to teach all children how to respectfully and safely interact with dogs. Lhasas don't always do well with other dogs or cats, but with proper socialization, they can be trained to successfully live with other animals.",
  "care_description": "The two biggest things about caring for a Lhasa Apso as a pet are their grooming and training needs. Some pet parents choose to keep the dog's hair shorter to make it more manageable, but a long coat is kept if the pup will participate in dog shows. When it comes to training, it's essential to not just teach them commands but to properly socialize them with other dogs and humans.",
  "grooming_description": "The Lhasa Apso dog is known for having a dense double coat that parts in the middle and drapes down to the floor. The breed will need to be brushed and trimmed regularly to help keep shedding at bay. A comb or slicker brush should do the trick on a daily basis, but having a detangling kit on hand can also be helpful. If the hair is kept long, you'll see many of these dogs with a ponytail to keep those lengthy strands out of their eyes. To avoid daily grooming, many pet parents keep their Lhasa Apso's coat in a short puppy cut, which is about one- to two-inches long all over their body.\n\nBecause of their long hair, a Lhasa Apso puppy may need to be bathed every four to six weeks, depending on how much dirt they pick up and how well-maintained their coat is in between baths.\n\nLhasa Apso dogs' nails need to be cut on a regular basis, just like any other breed. Depending on how active your pup is, you may need to trim them about once a month. You'll know it's time when you hear the familiar tap-tap-tap on your hardwood and tile floors.\n\nLhasa Apsos tend to have a bit of an underbite, which may make them more susceptible to teeth issues, so it's essential to start brushing their teeth as a puppy—the earlier you start, the faster your dog will get used to it, too! Work up to daily brushing. Your vet can teach you how to brush your dog's teeth, and it's recommended to get an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not the groomer).",
  "training_description": "Training is essential for Lhasa Apso dogs. It's best to start socializing and training them while they're puppies, as they can be very independent and strong-willed. And an untrained pup may leave you dealing with a lot of behavior problems later. Basic commands such as sit, stay, come, and leave it are a good place to start, and this intelligent breed can also have fun with agility or the AKC Canine Good Citizen program.\n\nObedience classes can help your dog learn both training skills and socialization skills around other dogs. Outside of class, expose your Lhasa Apso to many different people and dogs of all shapes and sizes, being sure to give them breaks if they start to get scared or overstimulated. While this breed can be headstrong, they are also a calm breed who responds well to positive reinforcement training that rewards them with treats, toys and praise. They learn quickly and enjoy the relationship-building time with their pet parents.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Lhasa Apsos do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) as you choose a food to meet their nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nBecause Lhasas aren't highly active, you need to watch how much food you give them. Even one or two extra pounds can add stress to your petite pup, so it's important to be mindful of how much food they eat every day. Remember that treats equal calories, and calories add up quickly, so choose a treat made especially for small dogs or that are lower in calories when training or rewarding your dog for good behavior.\r\n\r\nYour vet can help you nail down the best food as well as a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their unique needs and lifestyle.",
  "exercise_description": "Couch potatoes, rejoice! The Lhasa Apso is a perfectly content lap dog, so you won't have to do much to give them the exercise they need. These dogs are not known for their speed, so a 15-30 minute walk once a day should be plenty. This playful breed may also enjoy agility classes or chasing a ball around the yard, but they aren't going to need it every day. A well-socialized Lhasa Apso will enjoy play dates with other pups, too.\r\n\r\nEven though Lhasa Apsos don't require a lot of exercise, it's important to take them on regular walks to maintain their weight and physical fitness and keep them curious about the wider world outside your home.",
  "ideal_environment": "Lhasa Apsos do well in homes with single people or families, and they do better with older kids. If properly socialized, they can get along with other dogs and cats, but they'd be just as happy as your one-and-only. (Lhasas love their people and are extremely loyal.) And because they don't need a lot of exercise, they are the perfect companion for apartment dwellers.\r\n\r\nTheir thick coat keeps them warm in colder climates, but you can easily keep it short if you live where it's warm or don't want to mess with all that hair. They do have a shorter muzzle, which means they have smaller airways and can have difficulty breathing while exercising on hot days. So, when you do take walks outside, make sure you keep it to the cooler parts of the day in the summer.",
  "health_description": "Lhasa Apsos have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years, but, like any dog breed, they do have some health issues. It’s important that potential pup parents are aware of these health problems so they can help their dog live a full and happy life.\r\n\n \t• Hereditary Kidney Dysfunction: Hereditary kidney dysfunction, also known as renal dysplasia or familial nephropathy, is an inherited condition where the kidneys do not develop properly and results in kidney failure at a young age. There is no cure and genetic screening testing is not available, but affected dogs should not be bred.\nDental Disease: More than 80% of dogs over 3 years of age will suffer from dental disease, and smaller breeds may be even more susceptible. Besides the loss of teeth and painful gums, dental or periodontal disease can lead to systemic problems such as organ damage. Brushing your dog’s teeth daily and getting annual dental cleanings by your vet will help reduce the risk.\nEye Problems: Lhasa Apsos are susceptible to several eye conditions, including cherry eye, dry eye and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Cherry eye occurs when your dog’s third eyelid slips out of place and swells. It’s usually due to weakened connective tissue and shows up as a pink or red bulge in the front corner of their eye. Surgery is typically required to fix it. Dry eye, when the dog doesn’t produce enough tears, is painful but often treatable with medicated drops. PRA is a degenerative disease that leads to blindness but is not painful for the dog. There is currently no treatment for PRA, but a dog with PRA can still live a happy life and genetic screening testing is available.\nPatellar Luxation: In this often-genetic disorder, the kneecap is able to slip out of place. Symptoms can include limping, pain and arthritis over time. While severe cases may require surgery, many cases can be treated with weight management and joint supplements.",
  "history_description": "Originating in Tibet, Lhasa Apsos are thought to have been first bred as far back as 800 B.C. to guard the interiors of palaces and Buddhist monasteries high in the Himalayan Mountains. Legend has it that the region's protector is the Snow Lion, and the Lhasa Apso dog is the earthly manifestation of the mythical being. Tibet's most sacred city is named Lhasa, so this breed is very special to the people of Tibet.\r\n\r\nLhasa Apsos were introduced to the United States by the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. The Dalai Lama gifted two Lhasa Apsos to Charles Suydam Cutting, one of the first Westerners allowed in the forbidden city of Lhasa. Cutting brought the dogs back to the US in the early 1930s, and they became the first Tibetan breed recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1935. Lhasa Apsos are now one of three Tibetan breeds in the Non-Sporting group. (The group of AKC dogs that don't neatly fit into another category.) The other two breeds are the Tibetan Spaniel and the Tibetan Terrier, and all three breeds share a trademark dense coat and curled tail.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Llasa Apso to your life? While Lhasa Apsos can cost several hundred dollars, expect to pay closer to $1,000 or more for a well-bred puppy. But for that, you often get a dog who's been screened for health issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact Lhasa Apso rescues, keep an eye out for the breed at local animal shelters, or search Chewy's database of adoptable pets in your area.",
