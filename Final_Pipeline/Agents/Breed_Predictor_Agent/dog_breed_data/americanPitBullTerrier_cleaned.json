  "breed_intro": "The American Pit Bull Terrier is a canine Hollywood star with a complicated history. Athletic and energetic, they were originally bred for fighting pits in 19th century England and America, but due to their love of people and eagerness to please, became popular family pets and dog actors. They're related to American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers and Bull Terriers'all of which are often lumped together under the loose term 'pit bull,' and tend to share an unfair reputation for their fighting past. But to those who truly know and appreciate them, the ABPT is an enthusiastic and loyal companion.",
  "appearance_description": "American Pit Bull Terriers were bred to be muscular and stocky dogs. Their impressive heads are large and shaped like a broad, blunt wedge, while their chests are deep and well-defined. Their short, smooth and low-maintenance coat hugs their bodies and comes in every imaginable color and combination you can think of, other than merle (mottled patches of color).",
  "temperament_description": "Your American Pit Bull Terrier would take a bullet for you but would still be a lousy guard dog. That's because they tend to become BFFs with everyone they meet when they're properly trained and socialized. Contrary to what you may have heard, this friendly'even goofy'breed brims over with enthusiasm for humans (even strangers), and one of their strongest desires is to please their families.\r\n\r\nWith one of these pups at your side, you should be prepared for lots of sloppy kisses and a constant shadow following you everywhere you go. You couldn't ask for a better family companion, and their well-noted love of children is a definite plus. While untrained Pitties can have a tendency to chase after small animals like cats or squirrels (thanks to their herding history), aggression towards humans is uncharacteristic of the breed, and biting is no more prevalent than among any other type of dog. With the right amount of patience and training, your pet can live peacefully with any four-legged sibling at home, once you make the proper introductions.",
  "care_description": "The athletic, high-energy American Pit Bull Terrier loves to play and needs a lot of mental and physical stimulation. Don't even think about leaving them with a dog toy in your living room and calling it a day unless you want a chewed-up sofa. Boredom is lethal for this breed'these pups really want to hang out with you while also working their mind and body. The good news? The time you'll be putting into their daily exercise and training is nicely balanced out by their relatively low-maintenance grooming needs.",
  "grooming_description": "Because American Pit Bull Terrier dogs are low shedders, they require less grooming compared to other breeds with high-maintenance coats. You only need to brush them once a week with a rubber mitt or firm bristle brush to remove any excess or dead hair. Want to make that coat really gleam? Just go over it with a damp cloth afterwards to smooth it out even further.\n\nYou don't want to bathe your dog too often as this can dry out and irritate their skin. Every four to six weeks with a hypoallergenic dog shampoo should suffice. You can also do a spot clean or quick rinse in between if your pet has been playing in dirt or mud. Get step-by-step instructions from a professional groomer on how to bathe your dog.\n\nBrush their teeth daily. Just like other dogs, Pitties can be prone to dental problems like tartar buildup, bad breath and bacterial infections'all of which can lead to more serious health issues down the road. So, it's important to keep their teeth healthy. Ask your vet how to get your puppy used to regular tooth brushing from a young age (watch our how to video here) and don't forget to bring them in for a professional cleaning every year.\n\nClip your American Pit Bull Terrier's nails every couple of weeks to prevent cracking or breaking. (Get step-by-step instructions on trimming dog nails here.) You'll know it's time when you hear them clicking across your hardwood floor or their paws get caught up in the carpet. Try to schedule this during their down time, after they've been out for a long walk or feel relaxed after a satisfying meal. It will be easier on both of you as your pet is less likely to squirm in your arms.\n\nWhen grooming, check their ears for signs of infection, like foul smells or discharge, rashes, redness or swelling. If you do notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your vet right away.",
  "training_description": "Between their irresistible zest for life and their ability to make instant buddies wherever they go, a well-trained American Pit Bull Terrier dog is a joy to behold. The trick is to start socialization and obedience training when your pup is young (starting at 8 weeks old), so they have time to get into a comfortable routine and bond with you. An uber-intelligent American Pit Bull Terrier puppy lives to please, so lots of love is the key to their heart, along with rewards, treats and positive reinforcement techniques. While they respect confident pet parents who set and enforce boundaries, you should never act aggressively as it may teach your dog to only respond to aggression in the future.\n\nLike many dogs, American Pit Bull Terriers benefit from a consistent and positive training program. From getting your pup used to a variety of people and situations to going on doggy dates, early socialization should be your top priority. Training your dog to keep focused on you even in the presence of unfamiliar pets will allow you to hold as much control in the dog park as in your living room. Keeping them on a leash while outdoors may be necessary to help them play nice with other dogs they're meeting for the first time (and depending on where you are, it may be the law to keep dogs leashed). Watch our tutorial on how to leash train your dog.\n\nBecause of their smarts and lovable nature, this breed is a lot of fun to train and also does well in advanced dog sports, like agility, obedience and weight pulling. As they show off their brawn and brains, your pup will make you proud to be their pet parent!",
  "diet_nutrition": "American Pit Bull Terriers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to choose a food that meets nutritional standards set by the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) and to factor in their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) when choosing the right formula for them. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\n\nWhen rewarding your American Pit Bull Terrier for good behavior, look for training treats, which are usually small in size. Remember, treats count toward their total calorie intake for the day and should make up no more than 10% of their overall diet.",
  "exercise_description": "To keep American Pit Bull Terriers happy and healthy, you should exercise their bodies as well as their minds. Doing activities together is essential as leaving these dogs to their own devices could mean trouble, along with an unexpected crater or two in the backyard. So schedule at least one to two hours of intense activities every day and forget about penciling that in. For this commitment, you'll have to use permanent marker because the couch is simply not an option for these high-energy pups.\r\n\r\nRunning or jogging together, playing tug-of-war games, Frisbee or flyball, and agility obstacle courses are all great ways to meet these dog's high exercise needs and let them vent out their energy. When out for a walk, Pitties love to sniff and explore everything in sight. Allow it happily, as this easily excitable breed finds the game of scent especially relaxing (whatever works!). Don't forget to alternate those leisurely walks with lots of training tricks, dog puzzles and mental challenges to keep this brainy dog both focused and entertained.\r\n\r\nAs with any games you might play with dogs, make sure to regulate your pup's excitement and intensity so it doesn't escalate into unwanted behaviors like nipping or growling.",
  "ideal_environment": "Strutting their stuff for their pet parents is central to the American Pit Bull Terrier's personality. Whether they're jumping in the air to catch a Frisbee or leisurely sniffing the daisies along their morning route, they just want to be by your side.\r\n\r\nThese loyal companions have a lot of energy and need to be taken out for intense activities every day without fail, so they do best in spacious environments where they can expend their energy and with pet parents who will make time for them. Slackers need not apply. The American Pit Bull Terrier breed can be excellent family members and loving with kids and other pets as well. The one caveat: As with any dog, they must be socialized properly and consistently and supervised to ensure their playtime doesn't get too rough. Because they are so chummy with strangers, you don't have to worry about hosting dinner parties. They will enjoy nothing more than adding friends to their ever-expanding roster!",
  "health_description": "The American Pit Bull Terrier has a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years and can be susceptible to a range of health issues. It is important to be aware of potential health problems, so you can help your pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: This inherited disease is common in bully breeds. It causes their hip joints to form improperly and can lead to arthritis. If your pup has difficulty getting up or develops lameness in their hind legs, take them to the vet to get X-rays of their joints and have their arthritis managed with medication. In severe cases, surgery can be an option.\r\n \tKnee Problems: The cranial cruciate ligament (or CCL), which is one of the most important stabilizers inside the knee (in humans called the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL), can rupture over time. When the CCL becomes damaged or torn in a dog, surgery is typically required to repair it.\r\n \tSkin Infections: A lack of zinc or an inability to absorb it could make your American Pit Bull Terrier prone to zinc-responsive dermatosis, a type of skin infection. To treat the symptoms, which can include lesions on the nose and foot pads or red, oozing skin around the face, vets can prescribe a regimen of zinc to add to your dog's diet. Allergies can also cause skin issues. More on that below.\r\n \tAllergies: Bully breeds are very susceptible to a variety of allergic triggers and have chronic skin issues as a result. Allergies can be triggered by diet ingredients or environmental factors including pollens, grasses, flea activity, and dust mites inside the home. Affected dogs may develop symptoms that include itching, skin rashes, redness of the skin and hair loss.\r\n \tBlindness: Bully breeds are slightly more likely to develop cataracts as they age. Cataracts are cloudy areas that develop in the lens of the eye, causing affected dogs to have a progressive loss of vision. Symptoms may include a white, hazy appearance to the lenses, poor vision in low light, and clumsiness or disorientation in unfamiliar spaces. This condition can be treated with surgery to remove the cataracts.",
  "history_description": "The American Pit Bull Terrier is one of several breeds who can trace their origin all the way back to the now-extinct Old English Bulldog and Old English Terriers. Such dogs were crossbred to fight each other in the dog fighting pits of England.\n\nIn the late 19th century, European immigrants brought some of these dogs to the U.S. Here they found work on farms and ranches, catching hogs, hunting, driving livestock, and acting as family companions. As they gained in popularity, so did the desire for them to be officially recognized as a breed. In 1898, the U.S.-based United Kennel Club recognized the American Pit Bull Terrier, with the first dog to be registered belonging to the club's founder. Then in 1909, the breed was recognized by the American Dog Breeders Association.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the UK, dogs crossbred for pit fighting split off into two different breeds: Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\nNotably, the APBT is not recognized by the American Kennel Club. In an attempt to separate the breed from their negative past as a fighter, the AKC decided instead to acknowledge a subset of the population, eventually settling on the name American Staffordshire Terrier. The first group were entered in the AKC registry in 1936, after the AKC was assured by breeders that they would not allow their dogs to be used for dogfighting.\n\nAll of these types of dogs fall under the umbrella term of 'pitbull.'\n\nAre you looking to add an American Pit Bull Terrier to your home as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the United Kennel Club website. The average American Pit Bull Terrier cost is anywhere from $1,300 to $2,500 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to American Pit Bull Terrier rescue organization to adopt or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Learn more about adopting a dog.",
