  "breed_intro": "Is \"Adventure\" is your middle name? If you've never met a tent you didn't want to sleep in, a trail you didn't want to run, or a road trip you didn't want to drive, then the up-for-anything Bluetick Coonhound might be your canine soulmate. The rough-and-tumble outdoorsman of the dog world is ready for adventure, whether in the city or country. Bred for hunting, Bluetick Coonhounds are high-energy, hard-working dogs and want a job to do. But it's not all work and no play. These sweet-natured pups make devoted family pets.",
  "appearance_description": "Athletic, sleek and strong, the Bluetick Coonhound breed has distinctive colors that give the illusion of navy blue. That color impression results from black ticking on a white background covering most of their bodies, including their perky tail. Their pleading eyes and delightfully droopy ears create a charming face that is sweet and searching for love and companionship.",
  "temperament_description": "Bluetick Coonhounds are full of personality and are intelligent, loving goofballs. The Bluetick temperament is sweet-natured and personable, and they have lots and lots of energy. They thrive with pet families who lead active lifestyles. While they're good with kids but better with older children than super young ones—Blueticks can be rambunctious.\r\n\r\nThese hunting dogs are scent hounds, meaning they hunt by smell. They have a strong prey drive, which tends to kick into high gear around smaller animals, such as squirrels and other backyard creatures. So training is essential. Although, you'll never completely train out their desire to chase. But, since Bluetick Coonhounds also have intelligence to spare and are determined canines often described as \"craving a job\" (they'll love to grab your slippers or the morning paper), they enjoy the work. \r\n\r\nBecause they're so bright and a bit independent (those hunting instincts at play), they may be more challenging to train than, say, an Australian Shepherd. They need a confident and patient leader who understands the unique needs of this hunting dog and can bring out the best in this pup.",
  "care_description": "While the Bluetick Coonhound breed doesn't require nearly as much grooming as other breeds, you'll need to devote time to training and exercising this pup. Your Bluetick Coonhound will reward you with lots (and lots and lots) of affection. A happy, tired pup will gladly sleep at your feet.",
  "grooming_description": "Grooming a Bluetick Coonhound is manageable because they're moderate shedders. Brushing daily with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt, or a hound glove will keep them looking their best. And unless your canine compatriot gets into something particularly muddy or messy, your Bluetick dog will only need a bath about every other month. Regularly check those adorable ears for redness after your outside romps—be sure to keep them free of debris and dry to help prevent bacterial or yeast infections.\n\nAs with all dogs, you should trim the Bluetick breed's nails regularly to avoid pain while walking or running. You'll know they're getting on the long side when you hear that \"clack, clack, clack\" on the floor, usually every few weeks.\n\nYour Bluetick dog may have more problems with their teeth than other breeds because they drool quite a bit. The drool holds bacteria, which attaches to the teeth and gums, causing more dental disease over time. This breed should receive annual dental cleanings by your vet under anesthesia and non-anesthetic dental cleanings every three months to avoid periodontal disease or tooth loss over time. At home, brushing your Bluetick Coonhound's teeth daily with a dog toothpaste and toothbrush.",
  "training_description": "Be consistent and conduct training sessions in controlled situations (i.e., a fenced yard) where your buddy can't go off on a solo adventure. If you do this, you'll find that your pup does well and quickly learns basic obedience. A long training lead can be helpful when training your pup, even in an enclosed area. These long leads give your dog ample room to move around (especially when learning to come when called), but you can still gently guide and direct them when needed.\r\n\r\nNow, training your Bluetick Coonhound not to bark is another story. While it may be possible to train them to bark only at certain times, no matter how much you teach them and how much exercise these dogs get, they may still bawl or howl. It's just who they are.\r\n\r\nSocialization is also important to help bring out this pup's natural friendly disposition. Take your puppy on walks and let them safely meet new people and other dogs. Consider taking your dog to puppy school to learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new adults in one place.\r\n\r\nThis pup needs a calm and confident pet parent who understands the need for patience and consistency. These pups are best for people with previous experience with dogs. And, because who doesn't want another Pro tip, here you go: Blueticks (like all breeds) respond to positive training methods that reward them for the things they've done right (treats, praise and fun play breaks) and redirect them when they've done something you don't want them to do.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Bluetick Coonhounds typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to look for a statement on the food's packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards the Association of American Feed Control Officials set. It's also important to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\n\nThe Bluetick breed is prone to obesity, so offer treats sparingly and avoid people food entirely. Even an extra pound or two can create health problems for your pup, like heart disease. So, mix up rewards with massages or play breaks with a special toy. Chat with your vet if your pup has some extra pounds. They can help you create a mealtime + snack + exercise plan to help shed the excess weight and maintain your pup's nutritional needs.\n\nRemember: Your veterinarian is always the best source for developing appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines for your buddy.",
  "exercise_description": "Blueticks are born athletes and need copious amounts of activity—they excel at dog sports like agility and tracking and love to swim. Long walks, hiking and jogging, at least twice a day, are a must to burn their energy—about 60 to 90 minutes daily will probably do it. Be aware that exercising your Bluetick off-leash can be a dangerous proposition. If they catch an exciting smell, they will NOT come back when called—no matter how well-trained you thought they were. And because the Bluetick Coonhound's speed is a force to be reckoned with, don't expect to go catching them if they run off, either. For their safety (and your sanity), always have them on a leash when out for those walks, hikes and jogs. Pro tip: A GPS tracker attached to their collar may be your best friend (don't tell your Bluetick… don't want them to get jealous).\r\n\r\nThey can also become distracted easily while on walks, so make sure they know what you expect of them and teach them to refocus their attention. However, since they're scent hounds, taking them on walks that let them follow their nose (on leash) is an excellent mental exercise for them, too. In addition, training, nose work games and problem-solving through work-to-eat and dog puzzles are great ways to engage your Bluetick's body and brain.\r\n\r\nBluetick Coonhounds like having a purpose, and they aim to please. Teach your pup to fetch slippers or the morning paper—it's a win-win for everyone!",
  "ideal_environment": "Bluetick Coonhounds are the ideal companions for experienced pet parents who embrace these dogs for their wiggles, high-energy hunting and searching skills and talkative nature.\r\n\r\nBred for the hunt, Blueticks thrive most in a home with a large fenced yard or acreage. Their barking and howling don't pair well with apartment or condo living. Blueticks tend to \"follow their nose,\" given their hunting instinct, so keep your buddy leashed in unconfined areas.\r\n\r\nGood with other dogs and older children, Blueticks are natural-born playmates and flourish with affectionate companionship. Yes, they LOVE a good romp outside and a marathon (or two). But they equally crave cuddle time inside on your soft furniture, if you'll indulge them, or blanketing your feet. They'll welcome routine visits from familiar friends and family but will alert you to unknown and unexpected visitors with their barking and baying. And, believe it or not, Bluetick Coonhounds can socialize with a trusted family cat despite their prey drive. Why? Well, with the proper training, they'll follow suit and love them right back once they realize who you love.",
  "health_description": "Bluetick Coonhounds tend to have a lifespan of 11 to 12 years. While they are a generally healthy breed, there can be a few health issues to watch. Be sure to purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder, who routinely screens them for health and temperament problems. If you're adopting your pup, get a copy of the vet's wellness exam.\r\n\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Blueticks are prone to hypothyroidism, a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones. Signs can include dry skin and coat, hair loss, weight gain or behavioral changes. Treatment is typically daily oral medication.\nHip and Elbow Dysplasia: Dysplasia refers to joints that don't form properly, resulting in looseness that can cause lameness, pain, and arthritis. While potentially inherited, there is currently no genetic screening test for hip and elbow dysplasia, but dogs with either condition should not be bred. Treatment typically includes joint supplements, weight management, pain medication, and, in severe cases, surgery.\nBloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Your Bluetick's deep, narrow chest places them at higher risk for GDV or bloat. When a dog bloats, the stomach twists on itself and fills with gas. Left untreated, the disease can be quickly fatal. If your dog retches or dry-heaves (with no actual vomit produced), acts restless, has an enlarged abdomen, or lies in a prayer position (front feet down, rear end up), take your pet to an emergency hospital immediately! Treatment for this condition is surgery to pin the stomach to the side of the body to prevent future instances. You can help prevent bloat by feeding your pup smaller meals more frequently throughout the day with a slow feeder and waiting an hour before and after meals before strenuous exercise.\nCataracts: Older Blueticks often develop cataracts, which give their eyes a cloudy, opaque appearance. While many dogs adjust to eyesight loss well later in life, surgery can also be an option. Your vet will examine your companion's eyes at routine appointments.",
  "history_description": "The Bluetick Coonhound's history is as American as a breed gets, and the story behind them is as colorful as their coats.\r\n\r\nBefore becoming a breed, the Bluetick Coonhound was considered a color variety of the English Coonhound. The Bluetick's distinct origins go back to Louisiana. They arose from years of crossbreeding by those looking for the perfect hunting companion. Legend has it that the Marquis de Lafayette gave French staghounds to George Washington during the early days of the American Revolution. The French staghounds were then crossbred with English foxhounds to create the elite hunting breed we know today: One with incredible endurance and an acute cold nose—a dog capable of picking up scents that are hours, or even many days, old.\r\n\r\nEarly Southern settlers liked Blueticks for their athletic build, stamina and determination, so they used them for hunting raccoons, as well as in packs of them to track down larger quarries such as wild boar, lynx, bear, and cougar. Blueticks remain highly sought-after companions for pet parents who enjoy the high energy of these wonderfully loyal working dogs.\r\n\r\nToday, Blueticks are iconic companions in old westerns, movies, television shows and cartoons. On the college circuit, the Bluetick Coonhound is the proud mascot of the University of Tennessee. The breed became eligible for American Kennel Club registration in 2009 and has been competing in the Hound group since 2010.\r\n\r\nYou can find a list of reputable Bluetick Coonhound breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The cost of Bluetick Coonhound puppies ranges from about $500 to $1,200 per puppy and increases in price depending on their markings and pedigree. You can also contact Bluetick Coonhound rescue organizations to adopt a Bluetick, watch for the breed at your local animal shelter, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
