  "breed_intro": "The first thing you need to know about the Bouvier des Flandres is they were bred to herd. This means pretty much what you would expect: They will be inclined to take change of the situation, even if that situation is you. Large, strong and family-friendly, they're the good-looking muscle that's there to keep everyone safe. Their high level of intelligence and energy requires you to stay ahead of them, or else they'll get ahead of you. But all that said, they're sweet and serene, all beauty and brawn, who just want to turn your house into their den of zen.",
  "appearance_description": "Bouvier des Flandres look almost like giant, stocky teddy bears. Their mustache, beard and wiry eyebrows give their face a unique look, while the breed's muscular body is powerful and heavyset. And with Bouvier colors coming in a rainbow that ranges from fawn to black, their rough double coat sets them up equally as well for dirty outdoor jobs or relaxing inside.",
  "temperament_description": "Affectionately known as “gentle giants,\" Bouvier des Flandres are assertive, but simultaneously loyal and intelligent. They have a strong, self-confident personality and need a firm hand when training. At the same time, however, they're loyal and loving—happy to spend time with your family on the couch or going for a long walk. Young Bouviers can be rowdy or destructive, but the breed typically mellows out as they age (Bouviers are considered fully grown by the time they're 2 or 3 years old).\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres is a working dog, happiest when they're herding a group of cattle or guarding your home to keep your family safe. Bred to help out with various jobs around a farm, today's Bouviers are equally as happy acting as police dogs or service dogs. Don't be afraid to give your Bouvier a job in your household—that's exactly what they want. (And that laundry isn't going to fold itself, after all.)\r\n\r\nBouvier des Flandres tend to do well with kids, especially if they grow up alongside them. But Bouviers don't always get along with other animals; they can be dominant over other dogs, and their high prey drive may interfere with their relationship with cats. Slow introductions and setting firm boundaries can help improve a Bouvier's relationship with other pets. To people outside your family, Bouviers' traits may show up as reserved or aloof (that's where those guard dog tendencies come in). But to the members of your household, a Bouvier will be affectionate and loyal to the end.",
  "care_description": "Between their curly coat, assertive personality and strong work ethic, Bouviers des Flandres have a unique set of needs. For an experienced pet parent, however, a Bouvier won't be overly difficult to take care of. And your Bouvier will give you ample reward for your hard work—offering their love, dependability and protection of your home.",
  "grooming_description": "Bouvier shedding is minimal. However, this breed has a double coat that's water-resistant and their coat gets dirty fast, leaving the Bouvier with a unique set of grooming needs. This is not a wash-and-wear type of dog: Bouvier des Flandres grooming often takes much more time than grooming other dog breeds. Here are some grooming tips for your Bouvier:\n\n \t• Brushing: Your Bouvier will need to be brushed at least once a week. This will help work out any tangles or mats in their long fur. You'll likely end up brushing your Bouvier multiple times a week as they pick up dirt, burrs and other debris while running and playing outside. Use a slicker brush and a metal dematting dog comb to get the job done. Many parents also choose to give their Bouvier a haircut, trimming their entire coat to make those regular grooming sessions quicker and easier.\nBathing: Bouviers need to be given a bath a minimum of once a month. Again, this number will likely go up based on how much time the dog spends outside.\nNail trimming: You should also trim your dog's toenails after bath time so your Bouvier doesn't experience pain while walking.\nEar cleaning: Check your Bouvier's ears each week when you groom them to make sure their ears stay clean and dry. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \nDental care: Daily teeth brushing is important, too. Regular teeth brushing will prevent plaque buildup, which might cause tooth decay or infection. Your vet can show you how to brush your dog's teeth and can also give your dog a professional teeth cleaning once a year.",
  "training_description": "When training your Bouviers des Flandres, don't be surprised if you utter the phrase, \"Too smart for their own good,\" on more than one occasion. They are extremely intelligent dogs who can pick up commands in moments. Potty training and other basic commands are no problem for Bouviers. Their strong personality, however, can sometimes make them difficult to train. A mixture of firm corrections and positive reinforcement is ideal to help them learn. A new dog parent might feel out of their depth with Bouvier des Flandres training, but a more experienced dog parent should be fine.\n\nLeash training is extremely important for Bouviers. They're large dogs with strong herding instincts and an assertive personality—if your Bouvier isn't leash trained, that's a recipe for disaster... and a lot of running amok around your neighborhood.\n\nAvoiding boredom is also key for Bouviers, so many Bouvier parents choose to continue into advanced training with their dog. While it's important to practice basic obedience training commands, like sit and stay, make sure you aren't too repetitive or your Bouvier will make their boredom known, acting out with undesirable behaviors. Learning new things is key to keeping the Bouvier des Flandres physically and mentally engaged. Herding, dock jumping and agility are just a few of the areas where Bouviers excel. Because Bouviers are used to working in some capacity, training is extremely important for this breed.",
  "diet_nutrition": "All Bouvier des Flandres need a balanced diet consisting of high-quality commercial dog food that's tailored to their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Bouviers are big and highly active, so they need plenty of fuel to keep them on the go. Three to five cups per day over two servings should suffice, but speak with your veterinarian to select the best amount of food based on your dog's specific needs. Bouviers are also prone to obesity—so as hard as it may be to resist that scruffy face, limit the treats.\n\nExperts recommend that Bouvier puppies are fed a large-breed puppy food that has modified protein and calcium/phosphorus levels. This kind of food will help avoid juvenile bone disorders that can occur in some rapidly-growing puppies.",
  "exercise_description": "The Bouvier des Flandres' exercise needs are high. Experts recommend 60-90 minutes of physical activity daily. This will ensure your Bouvier stays both happy and healthy—Bouviers can easily become overweight, so plenty of exercise helps keep them trim.\n\nAs working dogs, Bouviers des Flandres have lots of energy and stamina. You'll want to put on comfortable shoes if you're heading out for a walk—your Bouvier will be willing to walk much farther than you, and frankly, a basic walk isn't going to suffice for their daily exercise needs. Try going for a run or a hike to up the game. Because Bouviers thrive when they have a job to do, you can also incorporate games and activities into your dog's daily exercise routine. Tug of war, Frisbee or an agility course will stimulate your pet both physically and mentally and put that Bouvier intelligence to work. Some Bouvier parents even participate in herding trials or a dog show. This breed also loves water, so if you have access to a lake or other body of water, swimming can provide a great way to burn off some energy. It's important to provide plenty of mental stimulation so your Bouvier doesn't get bored and turn destructive.\n\nAs your dog ages, you can decrease the amount of daily exercise based on their needs. However, gentle exercise is still important to keep them in good physical shape and keep the Bouviers' energy level satisfied. If you have a Bouvier puppy, you'll also want to be mindful of your dog's daily activity. It's important that the Bouvier breed is not overworked while they're young. This allows young Bouviers to develop properly.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Bouvier des Flandres needs plenty of outdoor space to run. A rural or country setting is ideal for this large dog, as is a home with a large yard in which they can speed around. While a Bouvier might be able to adjust to living in a small home or apartment, this isn't ideal—its essential they have ample exercise every day.\r\n\r\nBouviers are good with kids, although it's better if they grow up along with those kids so they view the children as part of their “pack.\" Keep an eye on a Bouvier around kids, and be cautious with small children—while Bouviers don't mean to cause harm, their large stature and herding instinct may cause them to nip at a child's heels while playing or accidentally knock over a toddler. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs. Bouviers can be strong-willed with other dogs and might not be a good fit for households with additional pets. Because Bouviers can be protective, they also tend to be aloof when strangers or company are around (at least, until you give them the go-ahead).\r\n\r\nBouviers will thrive living with an experienced dog parent. Their high level of intelligence and energy requires you to stay ahead of them, or else they'll get ahead of you. The ideal Bouvier parent would live in the country with lots of space for exercise. He or she should also be prepared to set strong boundaries and provide the grooming the dog will need.",
  "health_description": "Bouvier des Flandres dogs have a life expectancy of 10-12 years, and they are a fairly hardy breed. Like any dog, however, the Bouvier does have a few inherited diseases that pet parents will need to watch out for. Bouviers can also be prone to other health problems, and parents should speak with their veterinarians about those less frequent ailments. Common health problems include: \n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Hip and elbow dysplasia are congenital defects where the joint wasn’t formed properly, which can cause lameness and pain. Sometimes, these conditions require surgery. Often, however, they can be managed through weight management, anti-inflammatories and joint supplements. \n \t• Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder that develops in middle-aged to senior Bouviers. This health problem can be treated with thyroid hormone replacement. \n \t• Eye Conditions: Cataracts, glaucoma, entropion and ectropion are a few of the eye conditions your Bouvier des Flandres may develop. Cataracts and glaucoma can lead to blindness but may be corrected with surgery. Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inward, and ectropion is where the eyelid rolls out. Surgery may be a solution for both. \n \t• Sub-aortic Stenosis (SAS): SAS is a heart condition that is common in large dog breeds and can range from mild to severe. Severe cases cause symptoms like fainting, weakness and difficulty breathing. SAS is generally treated with medications and exercise restriction.",
  "history_description": "The Bouvier des Flandres was first bred in Belgium in the late 1800s. While their exact origin is not entirely clear, experts speculate that Schnauzers, Beaucerons, local farm dogs, and potentially Irish Wolfhounds and Scottish Deerhounds were bred to create the Bouvier as we know them today. Farmers used the Bouvier as drovers (cattle herds), guard dogs and draft animals (to pull carts). Essentially, Bouviers would take on any job that needed to be done around the farm. An official breed standard was established for the Bouvier in 1912.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s, war was brewing in Europe and smart, strong Bouviers were sometimes used to pull ambulances and carry guns and messages during World War I. The dogs who made it through the war were taken to other countries—and that's how the Bouvier eventually ended up in America in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres breed also served during World War II. The Resistance in Holland used Bouviers to carry messages at night. A fun Bouvier fact is that later in the 20th century, this breed became popular among royalty and presidential leadership: Ronald and Nancy Reagan had a Bouvier named Lucky, and a Bouvier police dog named Jango was sometimes used to guard Princess Diana.\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1929. Today, they're ranked as “somewhat popular\" according to the breed's AKC rating. Not everyone has heard of the Bouvier des Flandres, but those who have are staunchly devoted to the breed. If you're wondering about the average Bouvier cost, you can expect to pay $1,500-$2,000 for a Bouvier des Flandres puppy. Find a list of breeders on the AKC's website. Cast a wide net and keep an eye out at local animal shelters and Humane Societies, too. You never know where a Bouvier or a Bouvier mix will turn up. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
