  "breed_intro": "The Shetland Sheepdog is a high-energy, people-pleasin', award-winnin' pup. This sweet-natured breed has it all—brains, beauty and brawn. They literally excel at everything they do: show ring, agility and herding competitions, therapy and herding jobs, and of course, stealing your heart. The adorable Sheltie (as their fans call them) are clearly over-achievers whose playful and affectionate nature makes them a great choice for newbie pet parents. They're ready and eager to join in all your adventures, whether it's playtime in the backyard or a weekend camping trip. And, seriously, those gorgeous eyes?",
  "appearance_description": "The Shetland Sheepdog's intelligent, dark-colored eyes are filled with love when looking at you. Their long, luxurious fur is sable, black or merle in color, marked with white and tan highlights. With a wedge-shaped head and erect, alert ears, the Sheltie resembles a smaller-sized rough-coated Collie.",
  "temperament_description": "The Sheltie dog is an affectionate, loving friend who just wants to play and make you happy. With a low prey drive, they're great around cats or other pets, and they can be great with kids, especially their family's young children. (Although you might catch them occasionally trying to affectionately \"herd\" the littles!) Some Shelties are less tolerant of strangers' children, but this really varies from dog to dog.\r\n\r\nShelties can be cautious or shy around strangers, and a Sheltie who isn't well-socialized as a puppy might nip or even bite at strangers if they feel overwhelmed, so early training is important. Remember that each dog is an individual. Some Shelties will be very tolerant and almost never nip at anyone. They do also have a tendency to sound the bark alarm to alert their family to anything that may be amiss, whether that's an approaching stranger to the door or a rogue truck rolling down the street.\r\n\r\nShelties love to play and are quite intelligent, and the more time they have to burn off their high energy levels, the better. They love to have a home with yards or large spaces of land where they can run and play, but they can be just as happy in a smaller home too, as long as you take them on a walk or two every day.",
  "care_description": "Shetland Sheepdogs are a balance of low- and high-maintenance. On the one hand, while they require daily walks, they don't require intense amounts of exercise every day, like Border Collies do. But on the other hand, their grooming needs can be demanding, as their double coat needs regular brushing. Training is also necessary for the Shetland Sheepdog breed, to help them curb barking tendencies and meet strangers politely.",
  "grooming_description": "Long hair, don't care! The feathery locks on a Shetland Sheepdogs are part of their signature look, but it comes with a price tag: They have higher grooming needs than many dogs. Here are some grooming tips for your Shetland Sheepdog:\n\n \t• Brushing: Their double coat and long fur mean Shelties need to be brushed with a pin brush at least two to three times a week, ideally every day to help prevent their fur from matting. You'll want to pay particular attention to mats behind the ears, under their legs or on the back of your Sheltie's legs. A professional groomer can help you determine how to best keep your Shetland Sheepdog puppy mat-free all the way through adulthood. Like many longer-haired dogs, Shelties have seasonal \"coat blowing\" that occurs when the weather transitions from warmer or cooler or vice versa. When a dog blows their coat, they shed it in chunks of fur instead of a lot of little hairs. Your Sheltie will need brushing more than once a day during this time, since they'll shed more than normal for a few weeks.\nBathing: As for bathing, this is one area where you'll get a break on grooming. Like most herding dogs, the Shetland Sheepdog coat tends to stay fairly clean if brushed consistently. Bathing your dog just once or twice a month—sometimes even just once every two months—is sufficient unless they got extra dirty playing outside.\nNail trimming: Shelties need their nails trimmed regularly, but the frequency depends on how often they're walked and on what surfaces. Many will just need a nail trim every two to three weeks. You can check their nails during their regular brushing session to see how long they are, or talk to a groomer about how often you should trim their nails.\nDental care: Veterinarians recommend brushing your dog's teeth daily with a toothpaste made for dogs. Daily brushing can keep tartar under control and improve your Sheltie's overall health. If you start brushing your dog's teeth as a puppy, they'll get used to the feeling faster. You can also try brushing just a quarter of their mouth a day while they get used to the sensation. Your veterinarian can help show you the best way to brush your dog's teeth. You should also visit your vet for a professional yearly teeth cleaning.",
  "training_description": "To say Shetland Sheepdogs are very smart would be an understatement. In fact, researcher Stanley Coren ranks Shelties as the sixth-smartest dog, even above Labrador Retrievers! Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them an ideal candidate for training and learning new tricks.\n\nShelties are bred to be problem solvers, and as their pet parent, you'll want to add new skills to their training repertoire on a regular basis to keep them interested and engaged. Keep the training sessions short, so you aren't trying to force your Sheltie to do something they're not interested in. If you need any help, look for a certified trainer who specializes in positive reinforcement and ask them for advice.\n\nThese dogs can thrive at many jobs, from herding to being a therapy dog or more active agility training. Because they're so small, they wouldn't be great at protection work, but they'll be natural watchdogs in your home, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious, and sounding the bark alarm as needed.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Shetland Sheepdogs typically do well on high-quality, commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\r\n\r\nSince they are smaller in size, it's important to keep your Sheltie at a healthy weight and not overfeed them, which helps prevent health issues like hip dysplasia, which can occur in this breed. When determining how much to feed your dog every day, don't forget to calculate the calories in treats or extra kibble that you might use while training them. Interactive food toys can also be something Shelties really enjoy and help engage their brains as they eat.\r\n\r\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian, as they will be in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Shetland Sheepdogs are active dogs with a high energy level. They don't need to be on-the-go all the time, but they do need outlets multiple times a day to get all their beans out, and need about an hour of daily exercise. They'll love running around in a yard or in the countryside, but if your Sheltie is a city dog, then make sure you take them on walks or jogs regularly that last 30-60 minutes each day.\r\n\r\nShelties absolutely love herding—it's what they were bred to do! Since most pet parents don't have a flock of sheep around, consider signing your Sheltie up for dog sports, like herding or agility courses. This is a great way to meet your Sheltie's exercise needs and can provide an opportunity to lean into your dog's natural speed, intelligence and energy.",
  "ideal_environment": "Shetland Sheepdogs will love running around in the countryside or playing in a home's large yard. These affectionate dogs do tend to bark a lot, so you might not want one in an apartment with paper-thin walls. They can be trained to curb that natural instinct, but they won't stop barking completely. But as long as they get about an hour of exercise a day, they can be happy with city life too. They are a great match for both first-time pet parents and more experienced pet parents.\r\n\r\nThese dogs love their family and are happy to relax at home after a day of play. Shelties can be a little shy, however, so if yours is the party house, they probably won't be making the rounds and catching up with Susie from three streets over.\r\n\r\nShelties are great in multi-pet households—they get along well with other dogs, and since they don't have a strong prey drive, they can make a great companion for cats. They also are well-suited for families with young children, since they tolerate kids in their family well. However, you should still watch them closely around kids they don't know and make sure that children don't play too roughly with them, and that everyone respects each others' boundaries.",
  "health_description": "Shetland Sheepdogs have a life expectancy of 12-14 years. To help them reach their full lifespan, you’ll want to watch for the following health issues and talk to a veterinarian if you think anything is wrong. When getting a Sheltie, look for breeders who screen for these health issues. Ask to see the parents’ test results, along with others in the lineage, when you’re considering a specific litter. \r\n\n \t• Genetic Eye Issues: Sheltie dogs can experience a variety of genetic eye issues, including Collie eye anomaly (CEA), corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy or optic nerve hypoplasia. Your veterinarian can recommend the best approach if your dog develops any of these issues. \r\n \t• MDR1 Mutation: Like other herding breeds, Shelties can have a mutation on the MDR1 gene that makes them more likely to have a series side effect from certain classes of medications, most commonly ivermectin. A genetic screening test is available to determine if your pup has this mutation. If so, your vet will discuss if any medications should be avoided.   \r\n \t• Dermatomyositis: Dermatomyositis (sometimes called Sheltie Skin Syndrome) is a genetic autoimmune disorder that affects Shelties, Collies and other related mix types. It usually affects younger dogs and can include skin lesions and muscle inflammation. Your veterinarian will recommend approaches to help manage the condition, such as avoiding activities that damage the skin and muscles, avoiding UV exposure, or other measures, but there is no cure. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs when the ball and socket joint do not fit together well causing laxity. This can lead to pain, lameness and arthritis. Treatment may include pain medications, joint supplements and, in severe cases, surgery.  \r\n \t• Congenital Deafness: This genetic deafness may appear around 3-5 years of age as a result of degeneration in the inner ear. It’s more common in Shelties with white coats or blue eyes. If you suspect your pup is having trouble hearing, please make an appointment with your vet. \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Symptoms of this can include hair loss, a dry coat or skin, weight gain, personality changes or lethargy. A blood test can help screen for this issue, and treatment may be as simple as taking a pill. \r\n \t• Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Some Shelties can be prone to getting this immune disease where the immune system attacks a Sheltie’s own tissues. Symptoms may include fever, swollen joints or skin lesions. However, you’ll often need a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or skin biopsy to diagnose this disease because the symptoms can be so wide-ranging. Treatment may include medications (to help reduce inflammation) or immunosuppressants.  \r\n \t• Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC): Shelties have an elevated risk of this bladder and urinary tract cancer. In fact, Shelties are five-times more likely to develop TCC than other dogs. Increased urination or blood in the urine is often the first symptom. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or other medication. \r\n \t• Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA): Some Shelties can have patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a congenital defect where a blood vessel near the heart doesn’t close. This is serious and can lead to heart failure within a few months of birth. A heart murmur can indicate a problem, and a cardiologist can confirm the issue. Surgery has a high success rate with this issue if caught early.  \r\n \t• Von Willebrand Disease: Shelties may have von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder. Your veterinarian can test for this. While it doesn’t have a cure, your vet may advise that you make some lifestyle modifications or avoid certain medications that interfere with blood clotting. \r\n \t• Epilepsy: Seizures may occur between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old in dogs prone to epilepsy. While there is no cure for epilepsy, it can often be well managed with daily medications.",
  "history_description": "The Shetland Sheepdog's origins date back to the Shetland Islands in the United Kingdom, where the breed was used as agile herding dogs to move sheep, poultry and ponies. Shelties were bred for a smaller size so they would eat less in a food-scarce, cold environment. Their history also included serving as a companion who warned their family of intruders.\r\n\r\nExperts debate about whether or not Shelties are actually directly related to Rough Collies. Some think the Collie is just one of many breeds blended to create the Sheltie, which may account for why some Shetland Sheepdogs in the same litter can be such different sizes, weights and heights. However, others believe that Shelties are not directly descended from Collies at all, but both share a common ancestor in the Border Collie. Some believe the dog's lineage includes a Northern Spitz from Scandinavia, a King Charles Spaniel, an original Pomeranian, a Scotch Collie and other indigenous island dogs. However, the breed's complete lineage is not known and still a subject of debate.\r\n\r\nShelties were first recognized by the Kennel Club in England as the \"Shetland Collie\" in 1909, and the name was later changed that same year to Shetland Sheepdog. The first Shetland Sheepdog was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1911, after being imported from Shetland.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find a Shetland Sheepdog puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. The average Shetland Sheepdog puppy price can be $850-$2,000, with some even costing $6,000 or more, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. You can also find a purebred to adopt with the help of Shetland Sheepdog shelters or rescue groups. Or, search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
