  "breed_intro": "If your Havanese took a personality test, they’d be a solid ESFJ—a delightful extrovert who charms everyone with their winning attitude.\n\nTheir long, silky hair might be one of their cutest features, but Havanese dogs are less concerned with looking adorable and more curious about everything around them—like that flower over there, and that new person by the bench, and whatever their best friend (that’s you) is doing.\n\nPlayful and kind, Havanese thrive in almost any environment as long as they’re on the receiving end of round-the-clock affection and attention.",
  "appearance_description": "A silky tail curls over the Havanese’s back and wags happily as you walk through the door. With an intelligent face and soft double coat, their dark brown eyes are warm and bright.",
  "temperament_description": "There are so many things to do and see in the world, yet your Havanese’s favorite place is with their favorite person—lucky you! Whether you’re watching a movie or folding laundry, you have their attention, and they find you fascinating.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean they’re a homebody. On the contrary, this friendly dog wants to see the world and meet new people. If you, too, think that strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet, you’ve met your soul pup.\n\nThese social butterflies will make new acquaintances every time they go on a walk, whether two- or four-legged. While Havanese dogs look dainty, they’re sturdier than they seem and have enough energy for at least a couple of neighborhood sprints a day. The most agile Havanese may love dog sports like agility, too.\n\nThese bright pups will let you know when they’re feeling playful; they might drop a favorite dog toy at your feet and cock their head to announce it’s time for a game of fetch.\n\nWhen it comes to training, it’s easy-peasy. Because they’re very smart dogs and eager to please (and learn!), most Havanese pick up simple cues quickly.\n\nAnd if you have other furry friends in the house, no worries. When it comes to the Havanese, the more friends, the merrier. Just make sure everyone is introduced and socialized properly.",
  "care_description": "Many Havanese will need daily brushing, but this just gives you extra time to bond. They’ll also need training (either with your guidance or in a class with other pups), along with a moderate exercise routine.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Give your dog a bath once a month (unless they get super dirty, then more often is OK). Don’t share shampoos—your pup always needs dog-safe suds.  \nBrushing: The Havanese dog breed has a silky double coat, so daily brushing is a must if you leave it long. A pin brush will work best for any Havanese haircut, and you can use a detangling spray, too. If your dog does get tangles, buy a good detangling brush.  \nDental care: Many small dogs are prone to dental disease, so brush your Havanese’s teeth daily with a dog toothpaste like Petsmile Professional Toothpaste. Start brushing early when you bring home your Havanese puppy; they’ll get used to it faster when they’re young. Get a pro teeth cleaning at your vet once a year.  \nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails once a month. If you can hear the nails clacking on hard surfaces when they walk, it’s time for a pawdicure.  \nEye care: Havanese with lighter-color fur often have noticeable tear stains, and you may be able to clear up the stains just by wiping your dog’s eyes and face every day with vet-recommended tear stain removers. Do your best to keep the hair around their eyes trimmed short as well, as long hair can irritate them.",
  "training_description": "Start with some basic obedience training—like sit, stay, and come—when your Havanese puppy is 7–8 weeks old (or as soon as possible if you adopt a Havanese adult). Havanese are smart and very eager to please, so they’re easy to train. They may be small, but they’re highly capable canines.\n\nDon’t forget socialization, too. It’s important to introduce your pup to new people, places, and experiences so they’re used to novel interactions and become a calm and confident adult. Because Havanese tend to be social butterflies, they’ll probably adapt well to new situations, people, and animals.\n\nYou can take your dog to group training classes or get involved in a dog sport like agility trials, too. Keep them up-to-date on necessary vaccines, especially if they’re with other dogs in a group setting.\n\nAlways use positive reinforcement (with praise, special training treats, and toys at the ready) to teach your pup how to be on their very best behavior.\n\nHavanese puppies can be tricky to potty train. But this isn’t because they’re not bright—rather, it’s because their bladder is so small. Take them outside often and begin training as early as you can. If you adopt them when they’re older, never fear—like many dogs, adult Havanese are also great learners! You can even potty train them in their senior years; it’s never too late.\n\nTalk to your vet about crate training, too. Dogs like to keep their “dens” clean, and a lot of smaller dogs find having their own special space comforting. Crate training can also help with potty training!\n\nAlways make sure to choose the right crate size for your dog. The crate should be large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably, and it should have blankets, pillows, toys, and whatever else you need to make your dog feel cozy and at home.",
  "diet_nutrition": "There’s no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan for Havanese dogs, but every pup needs a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards. Choose a diet made specially for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).   \n\nYou may also want to choose a kibble that’s specially formulated for small dogs, like Hill’s Small Breed & Mini Breed Dog Food or Royal Canin Size Health Small Dog Food, so it’s easy for your petite pup to digest. Your vet can help you choose the right formula.  \n\nBecause of the small Havanese size, even one extra pound can make a big difference in your dog’s health. Remember that treats are great motivators, but they still count as calories, and obesity can lead to joint issues, diabetes, and other health risks. Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "They may be small, but Havanese have plenty of energy and need at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. Otherwise, they’ll find their own fun, which could mean chewing up your furniture.  \n\nDaily walks and games of fetch are a great place to start, and some Havanese also enjoy dog sports, like flyball and agility trials. \n\nThese smart pups need plenty of mental stimulation, too. They love interactive toys, games, and nose work.   \n\nDoggy daycare might also be a great option for your Havanese pup to keep active during the day if you’re at work or have other obligations where they can’t come along (make it up to them with extra attention and praise when you pick them up).",
  "ideal_environment": "Small apartment? The Havanese would be delighted to be part of your tiny paradise. Spacious abode with an ample backyard? The Havanese will happily come live in your kingdom.  \n\nThese pups aren’t concerned so much with the size of their living space, but more so that you’re there. Havanese love company, and they need a pet parent (whether first-time or experienced) who will give them a ton of affection and attention.   \n\nThis adaptable dog plays well with others (especially if well-socialized) and generally gets along with kids and other pets (whether they have fur, fins, or feathers).  \n\nAnd if you’re the kind of person who loves to host dinner parties for friends, your Havanese will happily agree to co-host—as long as you don’t mind being upstaged by a 10-pound ball of fluff.",
  "health_description": "The Havanese lifespan is 14–16 years. Here are some health issues to be aware of.  \r\n\n\t• Heart issues: Havanese are prone to heart murmurs. A heart murmur is the earliest sign of mitral valve disease, which results in the heart muscle becoming enlarged and pumping blood inefficiently. If your pup has a murmur, your vet will likely refer them to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).  \nHip dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is when the hip and thigh bones don’t properly fit, leading to a loose joint and (eventually) arthritis and pain. More severe cases may require surgery, but hip dysplasia is often treated with medications, joint supplements, special diets, weight management, and/or physical therapy. \nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease: A rare and likely genetic disease that causes bone death in the head of the femur and significant changes to the hip joint, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually develops in a pup’s first year of life, causing pain and limping. Serious cases may require surgery, but most Havanese puppies make a full recovery. \nLuxating patella: Havanese can develop a luxating patella, where the kneecap slips out of place. You might notice that they do a little bunny hop or skip—this could be a symptom. It may be treated with supplements and meds, if mild, though surgery may be needed. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can help prevent this condition. \nOsteochondrodysplasia: Havanese are susceptible to osteochondrodysplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone and cartilage development. This can be minor, in which case no treatment is necessary; otherwise, pain meds are a good option, if needed.  \nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): PRA leads to blindness in dogs, and while there is no cure, pups who lose their eyesight tend to adapt well and can still live full, happy lives.",
  "history_description": "Named after the capitol city of Havana, these dogs’ ancestors first gained favor in 1500s Cuba, where they were the favorites of wealthy farmers and the aristocracy. Unlike many canines of the time, Havanese weren’t working dogs; instead, they lived a life of leisure—just like most dogs today.  \n\nLegends vary regarding Havanese origin, but it’s fairly certain that Poodles from Europe visited the island in the 19th century, and the resulting crossbreed is today’s modern Havanese. It’s also believed that the Havanese’s ancestors include the Bichon Frise and the Maltese. \n\nWhat’s certain is that the little dogs only became more popular since their origin. In fact, famous English novelist Charles Dickens and famous American novelist Ernest Hemingway were both fond of the dogs.  \n\nDuring the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s, emigrants brought their dogs abroad, and the Havanese was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1996. \n\nTypically, Havanese puppies cost between $1,800–$2,500. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also look into Havanese adoption, as there are many puppies and adult dogs patiently waiting for forever homes. Check out a Havanese rescue like Havanese Rescue Inc., keep an eye out at your local animal shelter or rescue, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are Havanese hypoallergenic? Do Havanese shed?",
      "answer": "Havanese are often called hypoallergenic dogs because they’re low shedders. Brushing your Havanese pup will keep those flyaway hairs at bay (and allergy triggers to a minimum).  \n\nHowever, no dog is 100% hypoallergenic, as they all contain allergens in their saliva, skin, and even pee, to a certain degree. Talk to your doctor before adopting a Havanese if you have allergies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Havanese bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Like many small dogs with a bad rap for being yappy, Havanese can sometimes bark. They’ll bark when they need to tell you someone’s outside, and they may bark playfully when they’re having fun.  \n\nHavanese with separation anxiety might bark when left alone, but you can work with a certified dog trainer or behaviorist who practices positive reinforcement to help your dog feel safe and know things will be OK, even if you’re gone for a bit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Havanese good with kids?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Havanese dogs are great family dogs for kids. They love attention, and kids love them.  \n\nAs with any dog, socialize and train your Havanese, and teach children how to respectfully play with tiny pups."
    },
    {
      "question": "How big is a full-grown Havanese?",
