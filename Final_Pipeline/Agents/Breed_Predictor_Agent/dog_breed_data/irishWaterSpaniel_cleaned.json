  "breed_intro": "Sometimes called the class clowns of the spaniel family, the sporting Irish Water Spaniel can be lovable goofballs. They'll chase anything you throw with wild abandon—tongues lolling and ear-to-ear grins on their faces. Highly intelligent and independent, be prepared for a companion who'll keep you on your toes. These mischievous pups will play your game of fetch, but they may decide to take the long way back when delivering the ball. And grab your beach towel! With their webbed feet and curly water-repelling coats, plan on playing many games of fetch in a pond, lake or pool. Gundogs who were bred to retrieve fowl, Irish Water Spaniels love the water. (It's in their name, after all.) If you enjoy a good laugh and a good splash, you'll get along swimmingly with this fun-loving breed.",
  "appearance_description": "With webbed feet and a waterproof coat, the Irish Water Spaniel breed is part dog, part duck. A tousled topknot and liver-colored curls give them an endearing look. And their unique, hairless tails acts like a rudder while swimming. These cuties are sometimes confused for Poodles, because they both have curly coats and were bred to hunt. (You can tell them apart by their haircuts and tails: Standard Poodles usually have fancier 'dos and Irish Water Spaniels have longer and less-furry tails.)",
  "temperament_description": "Highly intelligent, funny and playful, Irish Water Spaniels are sporting dogs at heart, bred to retrieve fowl during hunting. Naturally, they love exercise that incorporates games. They'll even make a game out of training and often change the rules to amuse themselves. Teaching them to fetch? Expect them to find something else entirely different to fetch than what you threw, or to make a lot of stops on the way back to you. It's no wonder they have a reputation for being a class clown.\n\nWith their athletic abilities and love of retrieving, they should be kept on a leash outside in case a squirrel catches their eye. Otherwise, you may have a runaway dog on your hands.\n\nIrish Water Spaniels are very rarely aggressive, although they may be cautious around strangers. Early exposure to plenty of other dogs and people ensures this breed will live up to their friendly tendencies and help them be more comfortable in new situations and around new people and other dogs. And while they're quiet in nature, they will alert you when something's amiss, making them great watchdogs.\n\nIrish Water Spaniels are almost always good with kids—they're naturally playful, and their goofy antics will delight children of all ages. Start socializing your dog while in puppyhood to help bring out their friendly tendencies (and don't forget to teach the kids in their life how to play nicely with them, too).",
  "care_description": "Raising a healthy and happy Irish Water Spaniel dog means spending time on daily exercise, grooming and training—all of which is an excellent way to build your bond with your pup.",
  "grooming_description": "Great news! Irish Water Spaniels are a low- to no-shed breed. While you won't have to contend with dog hair tumbleweeds rolling around the house, you'll still want to brush your pup at least once a week. Give the whole coat a gentle once-over with a natural bristle brush to dislodge any dirt or debris, then use a wide-toothed comb on both layers of their double coat. Finish up with a slicker brush and give some love to the topknot and ears. And be sure to trim the coat and around the footpads once every two months with grooming scissors to keep it from getting scraggly.\n\nYour water-loving pup will make bathtime a breeze. Bathe your dog every four to six weeks, and take care to ensure the dog shampoo doesn't strip the coat of its oils—Irish Water Spaniels are naturally waterproof for a reason! This is a good time to trim their nails, too. The bathwater makes the nails softer and easier to trim. You'll know it's time when you hear them clacking on your tile floors.\n\nAs with other dog breeds, most vets recommend you brush your Irish Water Spaniel's teeth daily. Teeth should also be professionally cleaned once a year by a trained vet.",
  "training_description": "Training an Irish Water Spaniel puppy can be fun. This highly intelligent breed loves to please and learns quickly. But their independent nature can spell frustration for first-time pet parents, which is why they're usually recommended for someone who has experience with dogs. Irish Water Spaniels need someone who will be patient, calm and consistent. You can't give in and let this pup have their way if you want a well-behaved dog. And don't be afraid to enlist the help of a certified trainer or behaviorist. They can teach you how to work with your dog to bring the best out of your pup.\n\nFirst, teach your pup the basics, like how to sit, stay and come when called and how to walk nicely on a leash. From there, you can teach your dog more entertaining commands like \"bring me my purse\" or \"go get the toy\" to fun tricks like play dead and shake. Just be prepared for your spaniel to change up the game—they like to make their own rules sometimes. (Hey! It's all part of the fun.)\n\nBe sure to use lots of positive reinforcement—treats, scritches, lots of praise—to reward your dog for doing a good job and redirecting them when they do something you don't want. This breed loves to have fun, so make sure the sessions are fun and engaging and take breaks to play for a bit before both of you get frustrated.\n\nSocialization is very important for the breed, since they're naturally reserved around strangers. Getting your pup used to new new people and dogs while they're young helps them be comfortable in new situations as they grow up. Start taking your Irish Water Spaniel puppy on walks and let them safely meet new people and other dogs. Also consider enrolling in puppy preschool where they learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Irish Water Spaniel dogs typically thrive on a diet of high-quality commercial dog food. Choose a formula that fits their age (puppy, adult or senior), and make sure to look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though these pups are energetic, you still need to be careful not to overfeed your pup. An extra pound or two can create health issues for your dog, like heart disease or arthritis. If you notice your pup's gaining extra weight, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a diet and exercise plan to help your dog lose the extra weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Irish Water Spaniels' exercise needs can't be overstated. Originally bred as hunting dogs, nothing makes Irish Water Spaniels' tail wag more than playing fetch in a wide-open space or a body of water where they can show off their impressive swimming skills. Before bringing an Irish Water Spaniel into your home, make sure your lifestyle is as active as the pup.\n\nShort leash walks won't be enough for these athletic animals—they need one to two hours exercising outside a day. As their name suggests, they love swimming or any activity involving water. On land, they've got a confident gait that can cover some serious ground.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to keep an Irish Water Spaniel active, including inviting them along for your own trail running, hiking or biking excursions. As retrievers, these dogs are skilled at fetch, which gives them a chance to speed around the backyard. They also are great at dog sports like dock diving (playing fetch in the water), agility or flyball.",
  "ideal_environment": "Irish Water Spaniels need space to run and will be happiest in the suburbs or the country where they have the opportunity to expend their energy every day. Apartment living isn't out of the question, so long as this large dog has room to move around and you have access to wide-open spaces, like a nearby dog park, where this pup can expend their energy reserves.\r\n\r\nTrue to their name, Irish Water Spaniels dream of a home near a body of water like a river, lake or beach. Give them the chance to get in a few laps each day, and they'll be happy as a clam. And thanks to their temperature-regulating double coats that are perfect for swimming in cold water, Irish Water Spaniels aren't too sensitive to hot or cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are great around kids, are usually friendly with other people and make excellent family pets. Other dogs-in-law will be welcome friends, but smaller cats or other animals may stir up the breed's sporting traits unless they've had proper training and socialization since puppyhood.",
  "health_description": "Irish Water Spaniels have a life expectancy of 12 to 13 years, but they can experience a number of health issues. Here are a few of the potential health problems to know about in advance to help your pup stay healthy.\r\n\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: Dysplasia occurs when the joint isn’t formed properly and rubs, causing the dog pain. Both hip and elbow dysplasia can range from mild to severe, with some dogs developing a noticeable limp at a young age. Vets can conduct X-rays to diagnose hip and elbow issues. Treatment plans vary based on the severity of the condition.\nEye Problems: Irish Water Spaniels occasionally have malformed eyelashes called distichiasis. This can irritate the eyes and may eventually cause corneal ulcers. Mild cases can be treated with medicated eye drops; more severe cases may need surgery. Some dogs also get cataracts as they age. Vigilance with eye exams during annual vet visits is important to detect these issues and determine an appropriate treatment plan, which varies depending upon the specific issue.\nEpilepsy: Some Irish Water Spaniels suffer from epilepsy. This may be an inherited condition, and the first seizure may happen between 6 months and 5 years old. Your vet can assess medication options to help keep seizures under control.\nHypothyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones. Signs include weight loss, lethargy and dull hair with increased shedding. Luckily, vets can typically treat it easily with daily medication.\nTail Injuries: The Irish Water Spaniel tail is naturally bare and may be susceptible to injuries like “Happy Tail Syndrome” (an injured tail caused by vehement wagging into a hard surface) or chapping. Injured tails should be examined by your vet and treated based on their assessment.",
  "history_description": "Irish Water Spaniels were originally bred to be companion hunting dogs who fetch and return game, but the exact origin of the breed is a bit murky. There may be some Poodle and Portuguese Water Dog in the lineage, and legend tells of a dog native to Ireland who may be part of the breed's modern incarnation.\r\n\r\nBut at least part of the breed's history is well documented: Back in the 1830s, a Dublin sportsman named Justin McCarthy, who wanted to standardize the breed, refined two different types of spaniel—the South Country Water Spaniel and the North Country Water Spaniel—into the Irish Water Spaniel. Boatswain, his beloved pup, became the first official Irish Water Spaniel purebred.\r\n\r\nBy 1859, this new kind of spaniel began to appear in dog shows. The breed came to the United States in the 1870s, where it became a popular sporting dog. It was one of just nine breeds to be registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) as early as 1878, six years before the club's official establishment. The organization recognized the breed in 1884 after the club was founded. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel breed is still considered relatively rare.\r\n\r\nLooking to add an Irish Water Spaniel to your home? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club website. Irish Water Spaniel puppy prices start at around $1,500. For that price, you'll likely get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, contact the Irish Water Spaniel Club of America, keep an eye out for the breed at your local shelter or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
