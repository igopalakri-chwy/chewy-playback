  "breed_intro": "The Scottish Terrier is often described as a big dog in a small package. These handsome pups will keep you on your toes with their confident, spunky personality. After a few days with a Scottie, you’ll learn why this breed is nicknamed The Diehard: Once they set their mind to something (like winning a game of tug-of-war), they’re surprisingly persistent.\n\nTheir courageous and determined temperament requires early, consistent training to promote good manners. But with an experienced pet parent’s guidance, a well-trained and socialized Scottie will quickly win you over with their deep affection and devoted companionship.",
  "appearance_description": "The Scottie’s looks capture the breed’s always-alert personality, particularly in pups’ pricked-up ears, bright eyes, and erect tail.",
  "temperament_description": "Scotties are strong-willed and independent dogs, but they are also affectionate companions who love to hang out with their family.\n\nAlthough most Scotties aren’t known for being cuddle bugs, they still enjoy being in your company and will happily sit next to you on the couch. But when it comes to strangers, this breed is often aloof and not all that interested in making new friends. (This is when socializing your Scottie puppy becomes important.)\n\nThe Scottish Terrier personality is influenced by their history as solo hunters in the Scottish Highlands. Because they were bred to go after small vermin, this breed can harbor a prey drive toward other animals, says Jo-Anne Riddle, president of the Scottish Terrier Club of Greater Washington, D.C., and an AKC Breeder of Merit.\n\nReputable breeders breed Scotties for more relaxed, amicable temperaments. When properly bred, socialized, and trained, “they can be very friendly,” Riddle says.\n\nHowever, even the best-behaved Scotties can be impatient with young children who might not understand the dog’s boundaries. For that reason, the terriers may not be the best choice for families with young kids.\n\nAs a working dog, Scottie Terriers need to keep their paws moving and the wheels in their big brain turning. These sport dogs excel at everything from scent work to barn hunting, according to Susan Finn, former president of the Scottish Terrier Club of Greater New York and an AKC Breeder of Merit.\n\n“They do love everything,” she says. “But most of all, they love spending time with their people.”",
  "care_description": "Though Scottie care is straightforward in some areas, their headstrong personality requires pet parents to step up their training game. Scottish Terrier puppies should learn basic obedience and be socialized early. This can help prevent separation anxiety and keep them on their best behavior when they meet new people and other animals.\n\nAlong with training, maintaining the classic Scottie coat means setting aside extra time—and money—for specialized grooming.",
  "grooming_description": "The Scottie dog breed has a double coat, with a thick, soft undercoat and a coarse outer coat. This coat doesn't shed as much as other breeds, but if you want to maintain the Scottie’s classic, shaggy look, your dog will require some careful grooming.\n\n“They're not a wash-and-wear breed,” Riddle says. “If you're going to have show dogs, you have to have them hand-stripped.”\n\nHand-stripping is a process that involves manually removing excess top coat hairs, rather than cutting the hair with clippers. You can learn to do this yourself or take your dog to a professional groomer.\n\nIf you want a routine that’s a little less maintenance, you can clip your dog’s coat every six to eight weeks, Finn says, but this will change the coat’s overall appearance and character.\n\n“The top coat is wiry and water-resistant when it's hand-stripped,” Finn says. “Once you start to clipper in it, it softens the coat. You lose that texture, and it loses its water resistance.”\n\nOther than their coat, a Scottie’s grooming needs are relatively standard:\r\n\n\t• Brushing: Brush their coat weekly with a slicker brush to avoid tangles.\nBathing: Bathe your dog as needed; this will usually be about once a month. Always use a dog-friendly shampoo to avoid drying out your Scottie’s skin.\nEye care: During bathtime, check your pup’s eyes, and call your vet if you notice any changes.\nEar care: Clean your dog’s ears with a vet-approved solution after every bath.\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth at least three times a week (but daily brushing is always best).\nNail care: Trim your Scottie’s nails about once a month, or whenever you can hear their nails clicking against the floor.",
  "training_description": "Scotties are smart, independent dogs. While they can do well at obedience training, it does take patience and consistency.\n\n“A good [pet parent] just needs to find what currency motivates that dog, whether it's food, treats, or affection,” Finn says.\n\nRiddle recommends leaving training to the experts and enrolling your Scottish Terrier puppy in obedience class, which can also be a great opportunity for early socialization.\n\nHowever, it is possible to train a Scottie on your own. Scottie puppies do well with positive reinforcement training. Spend 10 or 15 minutes daily working with your dog on obedience skills such as sit, stay, and leash walking. Keep each training session fun and upbeat to hold their interest. \n\nBecause this breed has such a high prey drive, leash-walking is an important skill for them to master at an early age. Always keep your Scottie on a leash when you’re in public.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Feed your Scottie dog an AAFCO-compliant dog food formulated for your pup’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Chat with your vet to find the best dog food for your Scottie.\n\nFollow the serving instructions on your food’s packaging to help your Scottie maintain a healthy weight. If you free-feed your Scottish Terrier, they’re likely to overeat.\n\nAdult Scottish Terriers should eat twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening—while puppies can eat three or four smaller meals throughout the day.",
  "exercise_description": "A Scottie needs daily activity to stay fit and healthy, but their exercise needs aren’t as demanding as other breeds. Give your dog anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour of exercise per day, broken into 10- or 20-minute sessions.\n\nAccess to a fenced yard is a good perk when you’re a Scottish Terrier pet parent. This gives you space to run and play with your dog while keeping them in a safe space. If you don’t live in a place with a fenced yard, give your Scottie the exercise they need with three short walks a day: morning, afternoon, and before bed.\n\nScotties enjoy most dog sports, says Riddle. While every dog is unique, activities such as Earthdog, barn hunt, agility, and scent work are fun for most Scottish Terriers. Scotties also often enjoy gentle hikes, but given their short legs, they may not be the best choice for someone who likes to hike miles at a time, Finn says.",
  "ideal_environment": "Scotties are little dogs who can adapt well to different types of living—if they get enough daily exercise. “They are fine in apartments, as long as you walk them,” Riddle says. \n\nAlthough a fenced yard isn’t a dealbreaker, Scotties enjoy any opportunity to frolic in their own private space, so backyards are definitely a plus. They love to play, but they’re also happy hanging around the house with their family. When your Scottish Terrier is inside, give your dog puzzle toys to keep their mind sharp.\n\nTheir spunky personality might be a little difficult for new pet parents to rein in, so Scottish Terriers typically do best with people who are experienced raising and training dogs. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a professional dog trainer for help if you need it.\n\nA Scottie’s temperament and their history as hunting dogs also mean they may do best as the only pet at home, and they might not do well with small and rambunctious kiddos. But older children who know how to properly interact with dogs can be OK!",
  "health_description": "Scotties are generally a healthy breed with an average lifespan of 12 years, according to the Scottish Terrier Club of America. Although they can be prone to certain health conditions, modern health testing has eliminated many of the most common diseases, Riddle says.\n\nAsk your breeder about health testing to ensure your Scottish Terrier puppy has been tested for genetic conditions. \r\n\n\t• Von Willebrand Disease (vWD): This is an inherited bleeding disorder that prevents a dog’s blood from clotting properly. Dogs with vWD bruise and bleed more easily, and they can bleed excessively during surgery. There’s no cure, but with proper management, many dogs can still live a normal lifespan.\nBladder cancer: According to the breed club, the Scottie breed is 18% more likely to develop bladder cancer than other breeds. Take your pup to the vet immediately if you notice a change in urinary habits, as this may be an early sign of bladder cancer.\nScottie cramp: This genetic condition causes benign muscle spasms, stiffness, and immobility triggered by moments of stress, high activity, or excitement. It’s a painless, episodic condition that doesn’t affect the dog’s overall health. \nCataracts: Scotties may be susceptible to cataracts, which causes clouding in the eye and may reduce vision. Cataracts are more common in older Scotties and can be treated with surgery.",
  "history_description": "The history of the Scottish Terrier dates back to the 13th century in the Scottish Highlands, where several types of terrier dogs were bred as four-legged vermin control.\n\n“They're bred to work in packs away from people,” Riddle says, which explains the contemporary Scottie’s aloof, independent personality.\n\nSottish Terriers are actually just one of the terrier breeds employed for pest control in Scotland, along with the Dandie Dinmont Terrier and the Irish Terrier. It wasn’t until the late 1800s that the Scottie we know today was bred consistently enough to be established as a distinguished breed.\n\nThe Scottish Terrier Club of England formed in 1882, followed by the Scottish Terrier Club of Scotland in 1888 and the Scottish Terrier Club of America in 1990. The American Kennel Club recognized the Scottie in 1885.",

    {
      "question": "Are Scottish Terriers hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "Despite not shedding much, Scottish Terriers are not considered “hypoallergenic” dogs. In fact, no dog is really hypoallergenic, because they all produce allergens in their skin, urine, and saliva (though some breeds produce less than others)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Scottish Terriers good house dogs?",
      "answer": "Yes. As long as a Scottish Terrier gets enough exercise and mental stimulation, they can be good house dogs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does a Scottish Terrier bark a lot?",
      "answer": "Yes. Like many terrier breeds, Scotties can have boisterous personalities, and tend to bark at unfamiliar people or animals. \n\n“They don't bark mindlessly,” Finn says. “They're barking at something, and they want you to investigate it.” \n\nYou may be able to reduce your Scottie’s barking by providing enough exercise and mental stimulation, and by using positive reinforcement training to quiet your pup."

    {
      "question": "Are Scottish Terriers good for seniors?",
      "answer": "Yes, Scotties can be a good dog for seniors as long as they’re able to get at least two walks every day. While not exactly cuddly, Scottie Terriers enjoy sitting beside their family on the couch, so they’re a relatively easy, low-maintenance companion for people with lower energy or mobility issues."
