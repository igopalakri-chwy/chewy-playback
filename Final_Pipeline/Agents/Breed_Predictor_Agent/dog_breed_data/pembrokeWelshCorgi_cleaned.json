  "breed_intro": "Life with a Pembroke Welsh Corgi is not for the shy. Why? Every stranger you pass will want to stop and say \"hello\" on your walks—and your Corgi will welcome all the extra attention. You'll be taking lots of walks, too, because these energetic pups love a good adventure. (But with their little legs, your outings will need to be short.) This adorable dog enjoys making new friends, but rest assured: You're the only person they want to snuggle up with at the end of an activity-filled day.",
  "appearance_description": "With perky ears and large, expressive eyes, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy could be mistaken for an adorable stuffed animal. As they get older, the dog grows into their characteristically long, slinky body but retains the goofy smile of their puppyhood. Short in stature, stocky and sturdy, Corgis are surprisingly agile and fast. They're known for their floofy backsides that are missing a tail, often called \"momo,\" which is Japanese for peach. And if you google \"Corgi sploot,\" we guarantee you will not be disappointed.",
  "temperament_description": "The happy-go-lucky Pembroke Welsh Corgi loves life. This breed makes the most of every moment, whether they're capturing the attention of everyone at the park or bonding with their family at home. The Corgi is independent, bold and adventurous—they want to go out and explore the world—but they won't explore too far without their favorite person. (Hint: That's you.)\n\nSocial interactions and training are important to curb their herding instincts. They'll often nip the heels or feet of those who move too quickly around them, especially young children or other pets. This means they will explore new things with their mouth (often by biting or chewing), which can be particularly painful when it comes to those puppy teeth, and can also be off-putting to other dogs as they get older. In general, though, they enjoy playdates with other dogs, especially those who can match their energy level.\n\nCorgis aren't known for being aggressive or biting. Still, they pack the personality of a big dog into their little bodies, including a strong-willed streak. That's another reason why early socialization and training are so important. It's also important to teach children how to interact with dogs.\n\nThese short stacks can make excellent family members—as long as they get regular exercise to burn off their generous supply of energy. While Corgis love to play with toys, they really need a daily long walk. Some Pembroke Welsh Corgis may enjoy a slow jog, but their short legs make it too difficult for them to keep up with a bicycle or someone running very fast. (They are not known to be very speedy.)",
  "care_description": "Raising a Pembroke Welsh Corgi is rewarding but takes some effort. Corgis are very intelligent and high-energy, so your dog will need a good amount of training. Thankfully, grooming them isn't especially complicated or time-consuming. These small dogs seem to have fun no matter what they're doing, as long as they're with their person, so you'll likely find yourself looking forward to the tasks involved in caring for them.",
  "grooming_description": "A Pembroke Welsh Corgi's grooming needs are moderate compared to other dog breeds, mainly because of their thick double coat, a short, light undercoat with a longer, coarse outer coat. The good news is they don't need a haircut, and you can manage their maintenance at home. Here are some grooming tips for your Pembroke Welsh Corgi:\n\n\t• Brushing and bathing: They shed year-round, but more in the late spring or early summer. Daily brushing with a comb and slicker brush is the best way to keep their hair off the floor and furniture, and a bath once or twice a month (especially during shedding season) will loosen the dead hair and make it easier to comb out.\nNail trimming: Every dog's nails grow at a different rate, but a general rule is to trim their nails every two to four weeks or before you hear them clicking on the floor.\nEar cleaning: You'll also want to check your Corgi's ears weekly for dirt or signs of infection, like redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nDental care: It's recommended that you brush your dog's teeth daily to reduce plaque and tartar. Periodontal disease can lead to sore gums, loss of teeth and even more serious issues like organ failure. Besides regular brushings at home, be sure to get an annual professional dental cleaning by a veterinarian to keep your Corgi's teeth in tip-top shape.",
  "training_description": "The Pembroke Welsh Corgi breed was born to herd, so they have a lot of energy and require significant training to keep their brains busy and occupied. The dog is very intelligent and loves to learn, so they respond well to training activities. They may be strong-willed but are highly sensitive, so they do best with positive, reward-based training. Be sure to use lots of treats, praise and play breaks to reward your pup for doing a good job.\n\nTeach your dog the basics, like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. You may find that commands like leave it and drop it are useful, too; a Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy loves to explore with their mouth, which can get them into trouble from time to time. After your pup masters the basics, work with your pup on curbing their barking and herding tendencies. You can help them learn when it's appropriate to bark and herd, but you'll never completely train those instincts out of your pup.\n\nEarly socialization, especially between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months, will help your Corgi grow up to be a confident, well-adjusted adult dog. Take your pup on walks to let them meet new people and dogs, and enroll them in puppy school. Puppy school is a great place to meet new people and learn to play nicely with other puppies.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Pembroke Welsh Corgi breed typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Be sure to look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\n\nClean, fresh water should be available at all times, especially on hotter days or after long walks.\n\nCorgis are prone to overeat and gain weight, so you may have to watch your dog's calorie consumption. Instead of leaving the food bowl out so your pup can graze all day, only put the bowl down at mealtimes. And don't forget to factor in the treats! Treat calories count too, so be mindful of how often you give your Corgi snacks and resist giving them scraps from the dinner table.\n\nConcerned about your Corgi's diet or weight? Consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their needs.",
  "exercise_description": "As puppies, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has seemingly boundless energy. As they grow up, they tend to chill out a bit; however, adult Corgis still need about one hour of exercise every day. A daily long walk or even slow jog will do the trick, but their short little legs can't keep up with faster-paced pursuits. If you're looking for a good summertime activity, Corgis love the water and are great swimmers.\n\nCorgis are working dogs, aka dogs bred to perform a job, so they love physical activity and having a task to complete. They were bred to herd cattle, after all! Many Pembroke Welsh Corgis also excel in dog sports such as agility, herding and tracking. Corgis are smart and need to keep their minds occupied, too. Whether that's through agility work or puzzle toys, keeping your Corgi busy will keep them out of trouble. If they're bored, they'll let you know with their high-pitched bark, or they'll run around and steal things, like your socks.\n\nThanks to their thick double coat, Corgis don't mind cold weather, but get hot easily. So, make sure you keep your outside activity to the cooler parts of the day in the summer months.",
  "ideal_environment": "Pembroke Welsh Corgis can make great pets for active pet parents or families—if they're trained not to herd the kids. If you're looking for a pup who will wear out the kids and vice-versa, the Corgi may be a good choice.\n\nCorgis love people and assume that everyone around them is there to pet and play with them, so guests should be prepared to interact with your dog. And if you have other pets, that's not a dealbreaker: Corgis can be trained to live successfully with cats and typically enjoy the company of other dogs.\n\nAs long as you can give your Corgi the exercise they crave, they can thrive in any home environment, whether that's an apartment or a home with a large yard. This loyal breed loves hanging out with their people, so they're happy wherever you are.",
  "health_description": "Pembroke Welsh Corgis have a life expectancy of 12-13 years, and the breed is prone to several health issues. Knowing what these health problems are and purchasing your pup from a reputable breeder can help ensure your dog lives a long and happy life. If you’re adopting a dog, be sure to get a copy of the vet wellness exam. \r\n\n\t• Elbow and Hip Dysplasia: Dysplasia is more common in larger breeds but can occur in any dog. Canine elbow dysplasia occurs when the elbow doesn’t develop properly and eventually causes pain, lameness and eventually arthritis. Hip dysplasia is when the ball and socket of the joint don’t fit together properly and the joint grinds, which eventually wears the joint down. Treatment may include joint supplements, anti-inflammatory medication or even surgery. \r\n\t• Cataracts: Corgis often develop cataracts, which is when their eyes become cloudy and may eventually lead to blindness. Many dogs adjust to vision loss, but surgery is sometimes an option. \r\n\t• Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA): PDA is the condition where the small vessel that carries blood between two parts of the heart does not close shortly after birth. Vets listen for a specific heart murmur, and surgery is often required to close the blood vessel. \r\n\t• Degenerative Myelopathy: Because of their long bodies, Pembroke Welsh Corgis are highly susceptible to degenerative myelopathy, which is a chronic, progressive and often fatal disease of the spinal cord. Unfortunately, there is no treatment, but genetic screening testing is available. \r\n\t• Von Willebrand’s Disease: This blood clotting disorder can be identified with a blood test and is important to check for before your Pembroke Welsh Corgi undergoes surgery. Most dogs do well in everyday life but may need a blood transfusion if they have a trauma or surgery.",
  "history_description": "The origin of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi dates back to the medieval period, when the kings of Europe showed off their luxurious carpets, textiles and tapestries to demonstrate their wealth. At the time, Flemish weavers were considered the most skilled, and kings often encouraged the weavers to relocate to their kingdoms. In 1107, Henry I of Britain invited a few Flemish weavers to move to southwestern Wales, and the weavers brought the dogs they bred to herd cattle and sheep with them. Those dogs became what we now know as Pembroke Welsh Corgis.\n\nBest known as Queen Elizabeth II's favorite breed, Pembroke Welsh Corgis have risen in popularity as a pet in the United States in recent years and are more popular than their cousin, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. (Originally considered one breed with two types, the two have been separate breeds since the 1800s.) The American Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke Welsh Corgi in 1934, and the breed is No. 13 on the list of most popular breeds in the AKC.\n\nAre you looking to add a Pembroke Welsh Corgi to your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. Depending on the breeder, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi price averages $1,000-$2,000. For that, you usually get a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you're looking to adopt, contact a Corgi rescue group or look out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
