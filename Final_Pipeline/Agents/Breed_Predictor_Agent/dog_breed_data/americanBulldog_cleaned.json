  "breed_intro": "You might expect a dog with a gaze this serious to be a very stoic pup, but that’s not the case with the American Bulldog. These lovable pups can be downright silly, especially when it comes to playing with all members of the family.  \n\nSometimes a bit of a class clown (like their cousins, the English Bulldog), these dogs are also bright and charming. They’ll ace training—once they set their mind to it—and they’ll appreciate it if you fill their social calendar with lots of stuff to do. \n\nThey won’t appreciate anything too taxing (they’re not known for their speed, after all), but they do need a solid exercise routine to burn off some energy.",
  "appearance_description": "The American Bulldog has a proud air that wins over pet parents and strangers alike. Their sweet flop-over ears are a prelude to this pup’s silly side.",
  "temperament_description": "The American Bulldog personality is easy to love. With a confident attitude, these pups manage to both take themselves seriously and also be total clowns.  \n\nThey make great family companions, and they usually do well with kids and babies, too. American Bulldogs may be a little wary of strangers at first (who isn’t?), but once they warm up to them, they’ll take the opportunity to put their charm on full display.   \n\nThe American Bulldog is well-respected as one smart canine, and they might even skyrocket to the top of the class at obedience training. Agile and alert, they’ll follow your cues during training and games, whether they’re learning to sit or just playing fetch in the backyard.",
  "care_description": "The American Bulldog doesn’t need too much time in front of a mirror. Grooming is minimal with this breed, which is great news because you can spend lots more time for training and socializing this active, bright dog.",
  "grooming_description": "• Bathing: Plan on bathing your dog about once a month or so. However, if your American Bulldog took an unexpected roll in mud or is just a little stinkier than usual, it’s time to suds up. \nBrushing: American Bulldogs have short coats, so weekly brushing sessions with a bristle brush are often enough to achieve smooth and shiny fur. Don’t worry too much about shedding; these pups shed lightly, so brushing will help their loose fur come off naturally. \nDental care: It’s ideal to brush your dog’s teeth daily. Get a pro cleaning at your vet once a year.  \nEar and nail care: Trim their nails every couple of weeks, and clean their ears once a month (but only if needed—your vet can tell you when and how to clean).",
  "training_description": "When it comes to training, American Bulldog puppies need a confident pup parent who uses positive reinforcement to teach various skills, such as how to walk nicely on a leash and come when called. Start training your American Bulldog puppy at 7–8 weeks of age with simple cues like sit, stay, and come. (If you adopt them when they’re older, it’s never too late to learn.)  \n\nAmerican Bulldogs are very smart dogs. So if it takes them a while to get the hang of things, it’s not for lack of intelligence, but more so because they can be a bit independent-minded. They learn best from pet parents who are consistent and patient with their lessons. Once you understand what works for them, training becomes easy.  \n\nRegular socialization with other dogs and people is crucial, as is introducing them to new places (think public parks, dog parks, and hiking trails). These social interactions give your dog a chance to explore a variety of environments and situations, all of which they’ll probably come to love.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best food for American Bulldogs is a high-quality formula that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). \n\nFeed an American Bulldog puppy large-breed puppy food for their first 14 months to support slow but consistent growth. Skip food or supplements with calcium—which could cause the bones of these bigger dogs to develop too quickly—until your pooch is fully grown. As always, check with your vet to help you choose a complete and balanced dog food. \n\nOnce your dog is an adult, ask your vet if you need to add supplements to support joint health.  \n\nTreats are an essential part of positive reinforcement training, but remember that they count toward calories, too. Treats should never be more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "Even though they have only a moderate energy level, American Bulldogs still need a lot of exercise. They’ll love structured walks and other low-impact activities that engage both their mind and body.  \n\nGet out of the house two to three times a day for playtime or walks that last between 20–30 minutes. (Walks, not runs, are great—these dogs aren’t known for their speed.) Trainers often suggest skipping the dog park in favor of more structured play for this breed, but if your dog really loves seeing his friends at the dog run and is happy afterward, then go for it.  \n\nAlso try hiding treats in the house or giving your dog a puzzle toy—this will help to stimulate their mind and keep them entertained. Simple games like fetch are also great for the American Bulldog, as are lower-impact dog sports like agility training or nose work.  \n\nIf American Bulldogs don’t get enough exercise, they just might find their own way to make fun—and you (and your shoes) might not appreciate it. So, give them the fun activities they deserve.",
  "ideal_environment": "Both city and country homes will suit the American Bulldog if you can offer enough exercise and playtime. \n\nFamilies are also a great match for this loyal, intelligent breed—but single people make great pet parents, too. What’s most important is that they have someone with the time to give them two to three walks a day and lots of regular playtime indoors (or in a yard).  \n\nThese pups don’t like to be bored, so make sure they have lots of toys; they also aren’t happy being left home alone for long periods of time. If you work long hours, they may be candidates for doggy daycare, or you could hire a dog walker to stop by to hang out and take them from a midday, neighborhood stroll.  \n\nThe American Bulldog will probably love your kids, but because they’re likely to be much bigger than them, it might feel easy for very small children to feel overwhelmed. For this reason, it’s smart to supervise playtime to make sure no one gets inadvertently knocked over.  \n\nProper socialization is a must for teaching these smart canines how to spend time with your entire family, and children also need to be taught how to interact gently with dogs (and not treat them like plushies, no matter how cute they are).  \n\nAs for cats, they’re probably not the best fit for American Bulldogs. That said, another dog could be a potential BFF if they’re both socialized and introduced correctly.",
  "health_description": "The average American Bulldog lifespan is 10–12 years. There are a few health issues that pet parents should be aware of.   \r\n\n\t• Allergies: American Bulldogs can have allergies caused by an overactive immune system. Symptoms may include itchy skin, fur loss, scratching, obsessive licking, redness, or recurring skin and/or ear infections. See your vet to figure out what could be causing your dog’s allergic reactions.  \nCherry eye:  Cherry eye is not uncommon with the American Bulldog. It’s when the pink, fleshy part of the eye’s corner (the third eyelid) becomes swollen and bulges out of its pocket. Discharge, squinting, cloudiness, bulging, pink swelling, and redness are all reasons to see your vet right away.  \nDeafness: Deafness, which can occur in one or both ears, is often linked to dogs with light coats (such as white). There’s no treatment for inherited deafness, but most dogs acclimate well to the condition and lead a full, happy life.  \nDegenerative myelopathy (DM): This is a neurological disease that affects the spinal cord; it slowly weakens, then paralyzes, the back legs and causes problems with breathing, vocalizing, and eating. There is no treatment to reverse DM, but physical therapy may help. If you notice anything unusual with your American Bulldog, like lameness or stumbling, see your veterinarian. \nElbow and hip dysplasia: With elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia, the joint doesn’t fit together properly. Signs include limping, and treatment might involve weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, physical therapy, pain meds, or, in severe cases, surgery. \nKnee ruptures or tears: The cranial cruciate ligament is a band of tissue similar to the ACL in humans; it helps stabilize a dog’s knee. It’s common for this ligament to rupture or tear, causing pain, swelling, arthritis, and lameness. Surgery is usually the go-to treatment.  \nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL): NCL is an inherited and progressive neurological disorder that usually shows symptoms starting between 1–2 years of age. The most obvious symptom is behavioral changes in the dog, and the pup will usually lose coordination and eyesight. At this time, there is no treatment.",
  "history_description": "American Bulldogs are descendants of Bulldogs that worked with butchers in the 17th century. Over the years, the American Bulldog breed was further refined and worked on farms in the southeastern U.S. \n\nThe breed nearly went extinct during the World Wars. But after World War II, two men (John D. Johnson and Alan Scott) worked hard to breed the last few American Bulldogs, which is why these canines survive to this day.  \n\nAmerican Bulldog breeders tend to charge between $1,800–$3,500. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder. \n\nYou can also adopt an American Bulldog puppy or adult dog who’s waiting patiently for their forever family. Check out local organizations like American Bulldog Rescue, keep an eye out for the breed at your local shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
