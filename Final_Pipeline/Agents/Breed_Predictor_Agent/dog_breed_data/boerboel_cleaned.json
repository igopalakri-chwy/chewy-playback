  "breed_intro": "Maybe you're looking for a loyal companion. Maybe you're a tough guy who wants a dog just like you. Either way, the Boerboel might be your perfect match. This is the consummate guard dog—in fact, they used to guard the diamond mines in South Africa. But they're so much more than that. These massive dogs turn into teddy bears around their favorite humans, preferring quality time with you over staking out the backyard on their lonesome.",
  "appearance_description": "Large and muscular, the Boerboel looks every bit of the guard dog they were born to be. They have a broad head and jowly faces, typically with a black mask. Their short, dense coats come in a range of colors, from reddish-brown to cream and can be brindled (subtle tiger stripes). The Boerboel is the most agile of all the mastiff breeds, and they run with strength and purpose.",
  "temperament_description": "Because the Boerboel was bred to be a guard dog, these giant pups are fiercely loyal to their loved ones. Their loyalty to their family means they will put themselves in harm's way to keep you safe.\r\n\r\nThey're also often described as being a great playmate for kids; they'll let children they know well crawl all over them. Even with their playful nature, these are powerful dogs, so all interactions with kids need to be supervised. That goes double when neighborhood kids are in the mix. If your dog misinterprets a friend's actions as a threat instead of play, they will protect your child. So, not only is it important to train and socialize your dog early, but it's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBoerboels are on guard duty 24/7. Even when playing with you, they've got one eye looking for trouble. They are wary with strangers and will not let someone they don't know into your home. You'll always need to make proper introductions between new guests and your pup when meeting for the first time. (Emily Post would be so proud.) But once your dog knows you consider them a friend, they'll consider them one, too.\r\n\r\nThis mastiff-type dog does best in a home where they're your one and only, but may do OK with other dogs or cats if raised with them from puppyhood. As with all interactions, proper socialization, starting when they're a puppy, is important to get them used to meeting new people, dogs and situations.\r\n\r\nBoerboels are strong dogs with a high level of intelligence, and they need a confident and calm pup parent to show them the ropes. The strength and size of the Boerboel is often intimidating to people looking for their first pet, so these dogs are best suited to someone who's had a dog before.",
  "care_description": "The Boerboel is a short-haired pup, but they're not entirely low maintenance. While their grooming needs are the bare minimum, these strong dogs will need a lot of time spent in training and exercising—so get ready to spend oodles of time building a deep bond with your pup.",
  "grooming_description": "Good news! Your Boerboel's grooming needs are minimal. Here are some grooming tips for your Boerboel:\n\n \t• Brushing: Brush your Boerboel dog once every week or two with a curry comb or soft grooming glove to manage their shedding and keep the coat healthy and shiny.\nEar cleaning: While you're brushing your pup, check their ears for debris and wax build up. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.\nBathing: Boerboels need a bath about every four to six weeks unless they've been super active or super drooly. (You may want to keep a towel handy to spot clean them or your furniture.)\nNail trimming: Bath-time is an excellent time to check their nails. The water makes them softer and easier to clip. You'll know it's time for a trim when you can hear your pup clacking on your kitchen floors.\nDental care: Don't forget to brush your Boerboel dog's pearly whites daily. Get your puppy used to the habit while they're young, so they'll be used to it as they get older. And don't forget to schedule an annual cleaning with your vet—there's some tartar buildup you just can't get rid of with a regular toothbrush.",
  "training_description": "Training starts in the home, and every moment represents practice. Start socializing your Boerboel puppy while they're young to get them used to meeting new people and dogs and be OK with new situations as they grow up. Take them on walks where they can meet and sniff new friends. Enroll them in puppy preschool (as early as 8-10 weeks old) where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people, all in one location.\n\nFollow up puppy school with obedience class where they'll learn basic commands like sit, stay and come and how to walk nicely on a leash. Because these are powerful pups who'll test your leadership—like any other growing adolescent—you may find the help of a certified trainer beneficial who uses positive reinforcement to train the pup. (Positive reinforcement uses praise, treats and playtime to reward the dog for a job well done.)\n\nBoerboels need consistency; use the same commands often and don't give them (or yourself) any \"days off\" or free days when the rules don't apply. They're looking to you to guide them, and if you don't, they'll fill the leadership vacuum themselves. Remember, these dogs need a confident and calm pup parent. That, coupled with their sheer size and power, make them better choices for someone with experience raising dogs.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Boerboel dogs typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food formulated for large breeds. Be sure to choose a formula that matches their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior), and make sure to look for the statement that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though this is an active dog, Boerboels are prone to obesity. As you're planning your dog's meals, be sure to count all the treats you give during training (and just because you love your pup). If you have any questions about your dog's diet or mealtime strategy, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you choose the right food for your Boerboel based on their unique needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Boerboels wanna hang with their own pet parents and closest family members—always. They're looking for highly engaged, well-known play pals for mental stimulation, too.\n\nAs a working dog (aka a dog bred to perform a job), Boerboels have high energy levels. They'll need about one hour of exercise each day. They enjoy long walks, playing fetch and even swimming or fetching balls out in the water. While fenced yards with lots of room to speed around is great, Boerboels are not the independent type. They want you to play with them and include them on your fun adventures, like that hiking trip you've got coming up, rather than just sending them outside to work out alone.\n\nAre you a bit competitive? You're in luck! These large dogs excel at dog sports like agility, obedience and weight pulling. You two will have a great time bonding over your competitive personalities, and you might just come home with a snazzy new championship ribbon or two.\n\nYour dog's brain needs a workout, too. Boerboels are intelligent pups who thrive on mental challenges. Teach them new tricks to keep their mind active and have a few puzzle toys around the house for them to solve. Remember, a tuckered out Boerboel is a happy and obedient pup.",
  "ideal_environment": "Boerboels thrive in homes with active pet parents. These pups need activity that works their bodies, minds and noses every day. Homes with a large fenced yard may be on their Top 10 list.\r\n\r\nHowever, they don't enjoy bustling households; Boerboels consider themselves the club bouncer of your home and will want to vet every person who comes in. Because they were bred to guard and protect, these instincts may go into overdrive in a home with people constantly in and out of the front door.\r\n\r\nBecause these powerful dogs need a calm and confident leader, Boerboels often thrive with someone who's had a dog before. Without consistent leadership, a Boerboel may think you need a leader and will happily take on the role. These traits can make the Boerboel challenging and intimidating as your first pet.",
  "health_description": "Boerboels live 9-11 years and, like all breeds, are prone to a few health issues. Understanding these health conditions can help your pup live the longest life possible. \r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is the condition where the hip joint is malformed and rubs, causing the dog pain. Symptoms include limping or “bunny hopping,” decreased activity and difficulty getting up. Treatment ranges from weight management to physical therapy to surgery, depending on the severity. \r\n \t• Elbow Dysplasia: Like hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia is caused when the elbow joint is malformed and rubs, causing pain. Symptoms include limping or stiffness and swollen elbows. Surgery is most often recommended. \r\n \t• Eyelid Issues: There are two common eyelid concerns of the breed: ectropion (eyelid turning outward) and entropion (eyelid turning inward). Boerboels should be monitored by your veterinarian and see an ophthalmologist if noted. Treatment includes specialized ointments and eye drops or, in many cases, corrective surgery. \r\n \t• Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): Typically seen in large or giant breed dogs, DCM is a genetic heart condition where the heart becomes enlarged causing the heart muscle to thin and weaken. Affected pets often need to visit a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart). Treatment is medications.",
  "history_description": "The Boerboel's history and origin begins in South Africa, when Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Town, first brought a dog to the Cape in 1652. As more Dutch, German and Huguenot settlers (Boers) arrived in South Africa, they brought large guard dogs for protection and big-game hunting.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, a dog crossed between a Mastiff and Bulldog resulted in a Boer Hunting Dog or Boer Dog. Over time, Boer Dogs were bred with other bulldog and South African mastiff types, possibly including the Bullmastiff, Rhodesian Ridgeback, English Bulldog and the Khoikohoi or Khoisan dogs, resulting in the Boerboel dog we know today.\r\n\r\nThe Boerboel breed's instincts led them to be excellent guard dogs, fending off wild animals and protecting diamond mines and farms from would-be thieves. According to legend, the dogs even fought lions—but these dogs aren't prone to fight, as they typically hold down their game when hunting.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 2014 and joined the Working group in 2015. (The Working group consists of dogs born to do a job, like guarding or search-and-rescue.) While not the most popular pup—they currently rank No. 123 out of 200—they are fervently adored by their families and fans.\r\n\r\nReady to bring a Boerboel into your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. What's the average Boerboel puppy price? Expect to spend $1,500-$2,000 for a pup; that should include health and temperament screenings and may include pedigree papers.
