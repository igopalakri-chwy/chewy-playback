Their herding behavior can be an issue in chaotic households with young kids and other animals. But this doesn't mean they can't excel in family homes. In fact, your ever-alert Beardie will eagerly steer friends and family out of danger. With early training, you can help your Beardie know when it's OK to use those herding instincts. It's also a good idea to teach children of all ages how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBearded Collies are rambunctious at all ages, which can be entertaining for friends and family. These athletic dogs love chasing, playing and running alongside you while doing everything from hiking to running errands. Instead of being left at home while you jog, Beardies would love to come with you. There's no such thing as too much activity for these pups.\r\n\r\nBearded Collie dogs' high energy level and keen intelligence can sometimes lead to a bit of a strong-willed streak, especially in training. It's not that they don't want to obey; they just think their way is better. Starting their training and socialization while they're puppies will help them see that you're pretty smart yourself.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Bearded Collie breed's origin and history can be traced back to the Scottish Highlands, where the dogs were raised to help shepherds by herding and driving sheep across the rugged land. The dogs were prized for their energy, wit and stamina—they worked long days. Because of their role and geography, they were often called Highland Collies or Mountain Collies. Somewhere along the line, these humble herding dogs found their way into the homes of the Scottish elite. They became quite fashionable, even appearing in portrait paintings with their families. By the early 1800s, the Bearded Collie types had developed a rather standard look, temperament and set of traits that match the breed of today. Beardies were a well-kept secret of the Scottish Highlands; they made their way to the United States only in the mid-20th century. The American Kennel Club formally recognized the breed in 1983.\r\n\r\nSo, where should you look for Bearded Collie puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/bearded-collie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The cost of a pup can range $1,500-$2,500. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you're interested in adopting a Beardie, reach out to a Bearded Collie rescue organization or your local animal shelter.
