        "h2_breed_temperament": "For a small dog, the Jack Russell Terrier's characteristics are most definitely larger than life. When you first encounter this breed's exuberant bark and tenacious drive, you might actually do a double-take. Their personality thrives on stimulation, so pet parents need to work hard to satisfy this pup's need for speed.\n\nJack Russells do well with kids and babies, as long as they are properly \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialized\u003C/a\u003E and training is a priority. Children should be taught to interact gently and safely with dogs as well. Mixing a Jack Russell with other dogs is usually successful if properly socialized and introduced, but the answer is a hard no when it comes to felines. The reason? This breed displays a well-known high prey drive, which means there's a great tendency to give chase.\n\nIn addition to bounding after kitties, their qualities also extend into excavation. That's right—a very strong desire to hunt often leads this breed to dig like there's no tomorrow, literally tunneling underground to try and capture vermin (think mice, rats and weasels). So if you consider your rose bushes to be a prized possession, sharing the garden with a Jack Russell may give you pause.\n\nStill, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more fun-loving, charming family dog than the Jack Russell. The breed's independent streak and innate determination come from their long history of fox hunting, though today's Jacks have traded this tough physical job for the more plush life of a Hollywood star. Watch for Jack Russell cameos in both feature films and on the small screen.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Fortunately, not a lot of time needs to be spent on a Jack Russell Terrier's short fur. But the time you save on coat care will be spent on training and in the great outdoors, running, trotting and playing to meet your Jack's energy levels.",
        "grooming": "A Jack Russell Terrier's grooming doesn't require heavy lifting, in part thanks to their relatively fuss-free coat and their small size. And their shedding is also on the low side, compared with other breeds. As with many terrier types, rather than using a brush, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-combs_c355_f70v83785\"\u003Estripping comb\u003C/a\u003E is recommended. Try this tool every six to eight weeks for removing any dead hair from the top coat.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003EBathing\u003C/a\u003E once a month is sufficient as Jacks tend to stay pretty clean. But if yours has been digging underground and getting dirty, they may need a bath a bit more often. Bath time is a great time to&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Eclip their nails\u003C/a\u003E. (You'll know it's time for a nail trim when you can hear them tapping on hard surfaces.)\n\nDaily teeth brushing from puppyhood is ideal. Remember, even if it \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Eseems like a struggle\u003C/a\u003E, regular dental care is important for fighting plaque and preventing dental disease. Be sure to spring for a professional teeth cleaning by your vet once a year.",
        "training": "Take advantage of your Jack Russell Terrier's intelligence by starting to train them early and often. A Jack's traits include a deep love of chasing and digging—but your training goals shouldn't curb these natural tendencies; instead, redirect them toward positive outlets.\r\n\r\nIn truth, these behaviors are healthy, rewarding and enriching for a Jack. So, the best approach is to ensure your pup has an appropriate outlet, so they won't destroy your lawn or dig up your tulip bulbs. One idea to try is to designate a sandbox for your pet, so they have a place where digging is allowed and encouraged. (It's a win-win!)\r\n\r\nFuture pet parents of this breed will be glad to learn the Jack Russell Terrier's temperament is very trainable. This dog is highly motivated and eager to have fun, so stick with positive reinforcement (yup, training treats are fine!) as you work with your pup.",
        "diet_nutrition": "A Jack Russell Terrier should do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Look on the package for a statement that says it meets nutritional standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). (This organization sets the standard for complete and balanced pet food.) When choosing dog chow, always shop according to your dog's age and pick a food that fits their life stage, whether you have a puppy, an adult or a senior dog. Talk to your veterinarian about the many options, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food and develop a suitable feeding chart for your dog, based on your pet's individual needs.\r\n\r\nIf you fancy yourself an accomplished chef and hope to prepare your dog's meals at home, always run the menu by your vet to be sure it includes the right mix of nutrients for this high-energy, on-the-go breed.\r\n\r\nWith all that energy and training, it's safe to say you'll be giving your Jack a lot of treats. But those treat calories count! If you notice your dog plumping up, your vet can recommend a plan to help your Jack lose weight and still get all nutrition they need.",
        "exercise": "Lace up your running shoes! Raising a Jack Russell Terrier means a solid commitment to vigorous exercise, so you should plan to walk your pet at least a few times a day totaling an hour. A healthy Jack would even appreciate \u003Ci\u003Emore\u003C/i\u003E walking, if you can swing it.\r\n\r\nHiking and running are also excellent physical activities for your Jack Russell, as is a romp in a fenced-in yard where your pup can roam safely. And don't forget that playtime is part of exercise, too, so consider a variety of toys that will give your pup lots of opportunities for enrichment and fun. These playthings help to combat boredom, so keep your Jack Russell occupied with fun toys of all kinds, such as ones that squeak, bounce at odd angles, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/interactive-toys-319\"\u003Ehold a yummy snack\u003C/a\u003E or light up when they roll.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for other options to help meet your Jack's need for lots of exercise, try dog sports. They excel at obedience, agility, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/sports/flyball-101-how-to-compete-in-flyball-for-dogs/\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/sports/rally/get-started/\"\u003Erally\u003C/a\u003E, among others. These sports are a great way not only to meet their exercise needs but they're a great way to strengthen the bond you have with your pup.",
        "ideal_environment": "The Jack Russell Terrier's qualities make this dog a solid pick for families with kids as long as everyone loves to move and both children and pup have been taught to interact each other. Remember, though, that the Jack is a very bold dog in a small-pup package, which means that, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pomeranian/\"\u003EPomeranian\u003C/a\u003E, they may act extra feisty around bigger dogs. As mentioned, a cat-free abode is best as this animal tends to chase all things feline.\r\n\r\nAn experienced pet parent is recommended for a Jack Russell Terrier puppy, as are homes with access to fenced space for running (again, because of the chase factor). Rural living is the ideal environment, especially if there's an enclosed area for racing and playing. Even though they're small, living in an apartment may be difficult for this lively breed unless the person is extremely active, and the neighbors won't mind all the barking.",
        "h2_breed_health": "The Jack Russell Terrier dog has a lifespan of 13 to 15 years, and health issues you might encounter are similar to those found in many other breeds. In general, this small dog is rather hale and hearty. Still, it’s important to be aware of these health concerns, so you can help your pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_multi_patellar_luxation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPatellar Luxation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: This health condition occurs when the kneecap “floats” in the joint and slips out of the normal groove that largely holds it in place. It may be caused by an abnormal curve in the hind limb or a shallower-than-normal femur bone. If your Jack is affected by this problem, you’ll notice they’ll skip or hold up the affected limb when walking. Treatment is usually medication, but in some dogs, surgery is needed to correct the malformation.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELegg-Calves-Perthes Disease\u003C/strong\u003E: A hip condition that can show up in one or both joints, this disease causes the head of the femur to deteriorate. While the cause is unknown, a Jack Russell Terrier may limp or indicate they’re having hip pain as a result. If it lingers, the disease could cause the joint to collapse. Pain medication is given in mild cases, and surgery is the go-to fix in more severe ones.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECompulsive Behaviors\u003C/strong\u003E: Barking, licking, chewing and tail-chasing! These are some of the compulsive activities you might witness in your Jack Russell Terrier. Jacks are very smart and need a lot of social interaction and structure. If this isn’t in place, boredom, anxiety and compulsions can be the result. The best way to address these behaviors is to stick to a regular exercise schedule and provide plenty of activity during the day (doggy daycare counts), stimulating toys and food puzzles. If that doesn’t take care of the compulsive behavior, have your vet check for any underlying health issues. If your dog gets a clean bill of health, sometimes anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEye Problems\u003C/strong\u003E: Among the vision problems seen in this breed is \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/eyes/c_dg_lens_luxation\"\u003Elens luxation\u003C/a\u003E, when the lens is displaced within the eyeball (surgery may be needed).

        "h2_breed_history": "As you might imagine, the Jack Russell Terrier's origin is closely connected to a man with nearly the same name: John Russell. (Jack is a nickname for John.) This British gentleman was both a reverend and a fox hunting enthusiast, and his goal in the mid-1800s was to breed an almost all-white dog so that it could be differentiated from the fox it was born to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe Jack was developed to venture everywhere a fox could, so their small chests and sturdy bodies served them well as they bored below ground. These working terriers also put their burrowing instincts to good use by stalking and digging out other small animals including groundhogs, raccoons and squirrels.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, the Jack Russell's hunting skills were less needed, and the breed transitioned to become more of a family pet. Jack Russells have also made a name for themselves on the silver screen and in television, including prominent canine roles in the movie \"The Artist\" and the sitcom \"Fraiser.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jack Russell Terrier breed isn't registered with the American Kennel Club, but two similar types are recognized—the Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier. But the Jack isn't without stewardship or its champions.
