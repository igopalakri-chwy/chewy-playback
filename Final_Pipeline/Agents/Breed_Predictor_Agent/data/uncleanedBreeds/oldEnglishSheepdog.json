Children should also be taught how to respectfully play with dogs. The OES can get along with cats with early introductions and, again, the proper socialization. The same goes for other dogs—the more they're around other friends, the better they do. Luckily, they can be adaptable and easy-going, freely sharing their affection with their family.\r\n\r\nSheepdogs take their job as professional herders very seriously and love keeping busy, so ensure you're providing lots of opportunities for stimulation.

And you know what else? They aren't even considered a sheepdog! Specifically, Old English Sheepdogs in the 18th century were known as \"drover's dogs\" as they helped move sheep and cattle long distances from the fields to the markets instead of herding them from the field to the barn like other sheepdog types. Fun fact: Their size, coloring, and shaggy fur helped them to blend in with sheep.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EAlso known as the Bobtail, this breed was promoted in the US by an industrialist from Pittsburgh around the time of their American Kennel Club recognition in 1888. Within 20 years, Old English Sheepdogs settled into the homes of five of the ten wealthiest American families, Vanderbilts and Guggenheims included.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EIn 1914, the OES won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The Old English Sheepdog also made it big in Hollywood with the 1959 Disney classic \"The Shaggy Dog.\" You probably have also seen this shaggy dog (in animated form) in \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"101 Dalmatians.\" The Old English Sheepdog is quite the movie star!\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003ELooking to add an Old English Sheepdog to your family?
