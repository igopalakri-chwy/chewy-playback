Beddies would be elected class clown if such awards were given out in dog school; they adore performing tricks and will keep you in stitches with pranks like playing peek-a-boo around a corner or hiding under blankets until you find them.\r\n\r\nThe Bedlington loves to be the center of attention, and does particularly well with active pet parents or a family with kids to run around with on a daily basis. This smart, inquisitive and typically easy-to-train breed will pay you back in kisses and cuddles after every outing.\r\n\r\nThe Bedlington Terrier breed has been known to nip or react when their paw is stepped on or their rope-like tail gets tugged. Bedlingtons like everyone, but are better suited to families with kids who have been taught how to play gently with a pup and not pull the dog's fur or tail. Young kids will need to be taught good dog manners for playing with the Bedlington (and vice versa). Bedlingtons may also do well with a companion kitty if raised with one since puppyhood, but outdoor cats, beware: The breed was bred to hunt critters, giving them a high prey drive that sets them on a chase when cats, bunnies or other small woodland creatures are spotted outdoors.\r\n\r\nBedlingtons are a friendly, social little working dog breed. (Working dogs are pups who were bred to do a job, like herd sheep or guard estates). In addition to hunting vermin, Beddies were also bred to be bait in pit fights, so while they won't start a rumble, they won't back down easily either. Still, with proper socialization and training Bedlingtons can do well with other dogs in the house.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Bedlington Terriers rank high on the personality charts; thankfully, their care is more toward the middle end of the scale. While their coats require a lot of maintenance (that haircut!), their exercise and training needs are moderate. Plan to spend about an hour every day exercising and playing with your pup. And because these pups are eager to please you, you'll find they're relatively easy to train.",
        "grooming": "The Bedlington Terrier dog has a double coat, which means it takes more effort to maintain it. These pups require monthly haircuts to keep them in their signature style and need daily brushing to help prevent mats. A good \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E works well on their fur.\n\nMany pet parents will send their Beddie to the groomer every six to eight weeks, but if you'd like to create that spa-like experience at home, monthly maintenance for your pup should include a bath, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enail trim\u003C/a\u003E and hair clip from head to toe. Bedlington Terriers get groomed with a specific lamb-like cut: short on the body, longer on the legs, with a fluffy arch rising from their nose up and over the back of the head. For those who like to groom their dog themselves, this cut may be harder to learn than other breeds that just get trimmed.\n\nCheck your dog's ears regularly for redness, swelling and debris, and contact your vet if you see any of the above. They may recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eat-home ear cleaning\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nMany vets recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrushing your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E at least a few times a week, building up to daily. Your vet can help teach you how to do it, and it's best to start when your Bedlington Terrier is a puppy, so they'll get used to it. Dental disease can not only cause problems with their teeth and gums but can lead to other health issues as well as a higher risk for heart, kidney and liver disease. An annual professional cleaning with your vet is also key to keeping your Beddie's teeth healthy.",
        "training": "Bedlington Terriers are known for their intelligence, their desire to please you and their trainability—these are some of their most beloved characteristics! But they can be strong-willed, too, so be patient as you train your pup. Beddies have mild mannered, sweet personalities and don't respond well to harsh training methods. Focus on what your pup does right (and not what they do wrong) and use lots of praise and yummy treats to reward your dog for a job well done.\r\n\r\nBecause they were bred to hunt vermin, training a Bedlington Terrier puppy how to sit and stay when around other animals may be a challenge. (Always remember to keep your pup on a leash for everyone's safety.) Be patient, stay positive and take a break when you both get frustrated. Your pup will pick up these skills—just maybe not today.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Most Bedlington Terriers do well with high quality commercial dog food. Make sure to choose a formula designed for your pup's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Most dogs prefer eating twice a day, morning and evening. Not sure how often or how much to feed your pup? Your vet can help you determine a mealtime schedule based on your dog's unique needs and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAs with most breeds, limiting dog-safe people food to the occasional treat helps to keep your Bedlington's weight in check, as even one or two extra pounds can lead to health problems down the road. And don't forget about the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/treats-335\"\u003Etreats\u003C/a\u003E! Your pup will get a lot of treats during training times and also, heck, just because you love them. But remember to factor those treats into your dog's mealtime goals. (Sadly, treat calories count, too!) Your vet is in the best position to help you balance mealtime and snack time to help keep your pup at a healthy weight.",
        "exercise": "Bedlington Terriers have moderate energy levels, so your pup needs about an hour of exercise every day. A bored Beddie is a destructive Beddie, and both physical and mental stimulation will keep your whole family happy (and your shoes unchewed).\r\n\r\nThe Bedlington Terrier breed loves to play, so fetch, tug of war, running with older kids or an organized canine activity like agility or \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/aboutflyball.shtml\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E fit the bill. Most Beddies like to swim, so a day at the lake with the family, laps in the pool or dock diving may be right up this breed's exercise alley.",
        "ideal_environment": "Though the Bedlington Terrier loves to run and is quite speedy, they can do well in an apartment or small home as long as their exercise needs are taken care of. These small dogs are especially well-suited for active folks or families with older children—especially those who respect the dog's boundaries and aren't too rough.\r\n\r\nBedlington Terriers can live with a cat if raised with one, and may do OK with another dog if well-socialized. Still, they typically prefer to be the star of everyone's love and affection. Their chasing instincts run deep (they're born hunters), so they are hardwired to run after the stray cat, squirrel or bunny that may dare to cross your yard. Take precautions with a strong fence and a sturdy leash.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Bedlington Terriers have a life expectancy of 11 to 16 years, but they do have a few health problems to look out for.
