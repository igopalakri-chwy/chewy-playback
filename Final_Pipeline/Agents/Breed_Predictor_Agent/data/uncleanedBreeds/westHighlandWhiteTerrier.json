        "h2_breed_temperament": "Westies are active dogs who pack a lot of life and love into that small frame. They're like that popular girl in high school who was student council president, captain of the field hockey team, took all honors classes, remembered everyone's birthday and made a mean red velvet cupcake. Not only are they a friendly, cheerful pet, Westies are confident, smart and tenacious.\n\nOutgoing and loyal, the Westie dog loves to be the center of attention and will keep you entertained with their energetic antics. These dogs love to play games like chase and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E and show off all the tricks they know. But if they don't get the exercise they need, those antics can become... less entertaining. You may find them chasing other animals, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-to-stop-dogs-from-digging\"\u003Edigging in your yard\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-training-tips-how-to-stop-your-puppy-from-barking-5-tips-to-try\"\u003Ebarking\u003C/a\u003E a lot.\n\nThey are good dogs for families with older kids, but can do well with younger children if they're trained and socialized properly at a young age (and as long as the kids in their life are taught to play gently with them). Don't expect a Westie to be your lapdog, though. Like all terriers bred to hunt vermin, they have a feisty, independent streak and could get frustrated if someone invades their space too often.\n\nCare should be taken when introducing Westies to other pets. The West Highland White Terrier puppy can learn to adjust, especially if \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialized from puppyhood\u003C/a\u003E. If you're bringing an older Westie into a multi-pet home, it's best to consult with a certified dog trainer with experience of West Highland White Terrier types to help with the transition. Westies also have a strong prey drive that could send them chasing after smaller pets. These behaviors can be tempered through training, but it does take time and commitment.\n\nWesties won't hesitate to sound the bark alarm (again and again) at a passing leaf or when visitors come to the door, but that rarely translates into aggression. Rather, once your visitor has settled in, your Westie will want to become their new best friend and show off their antics for a new audience.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Raising a West Highland White Terrier takes time and commitment. Their grooming needs are plentiful, especially if you want to maintain that distinctive show-dog look. Training is also a must; with their keen intellect, abundant energy and powerful hunting instincts, Westies need the mental and physical stimulation that training provides.",
        "grooming": "It's up to you to decide what kind of hairstyle your Westie will have. While they tend to shed less than other breeds, their overall grooming needs can tip toward the higher end of the scale. That quintessential Westie look, for example—the one you see at dog shows with fluffy fur around the legs and shorter on the back and tail with fluffy facial hair—will take more time and energy to maintain. Grooming a Westie to have this traditional look involves hand stripping once a month, which removes the dead topcoat to make room for new growth, and retains the Westie's hard, coarse coat. Alternatively, you can take your Westie for a spa day every four to six weeks for grooming, which will result in a softer, curlier coat. Pet parents also have the option of forgoing the show-dog look and keeping their Westie's coat trimmed short.\n\nRegardless of which look you ultimately decide to go with, regular brushing with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E is still required at least two or three times a week, though daily brushing is ideal. With their hard, thick coats, a Westie needs a bath every four to six weeks (or whenever they get really dirty!), and their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enails should be trimmed\u003C/a\u003E every two weeks. And don't forget their teeth! \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003EDaily toothbrushing\u003C/a\u003E is recommended for Westies to prevent tartar buildup and gum disease. Start them when they're puppies so they get used to the feeling, and remember to schedule an annual visit with your vet for a professional cleaning.",
        "training": "Training is an excellent way to bond with your Westie and provide them with both mental and physical stimulation and help reign in some of their more impulsive tendencies. It does, however, require patience and persistence.\r\n\r\nWestie intelligence makes them easy to train, but their independent nature and strong prey drive can sometimes derail training sessions. For this reason, it's important to train your Westie in a quiet location free from distractions, like a fenced backyard. If you're out at a park with kids, squirrels and other interesting things running by, that strong prey drive will kick in and your Westie will quickly forget all about training.\r\n\r\nEven when distractions are minimized, you may still struggle to hold your Westie's attention during training sessions. With their spunky confidence, Westies think they should be in charge. When this happens, gently refocus their attention to the task at hand. You may need to be firm, but you should never resort to harsh training methods; positive reinforcement with yummy treats and praise always works best.\r\n\r\nFor the best results, begin training your West Highland White Terrier puppy as soon as you bring them home; 8 weeks old isn't too early to start! And training sessions should become part of your daily routine. If you need help with training, look for a certified dog trainer in your area who's worked with terrier group types in the past and can teach you some Westie dog 101.\r\n\r\nEven though this pup is naturally friendly, you still need to start socializing your Westie with new people and other dogs while they're puppies to bring out all those wonderful qualities. Take your pup on leashed walks and allow them to meet new friends, both two- and four-legged. And enroll your dog in puppy preschool, so they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.",
        "diet_nutrition": "West Highland White Terriers aren't picky eaters, and they do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Just make sure the food you choose is nutritionally complete and balanced and appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Look on the label for a statement indicating the food meets Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) standards.\r\n\r\nYou should also select a food that's appropriate for your dog's age, weight and activity level. Older dogs need less fat and protein than growing puppies (and fewer calories, too!). If you feed puppy food to an adult dog, they'll end up obese, which can cause a host of other health problems. And don't forget about dog treats! Those count toward the Westie's daily caloric intake.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure what or how much to feed your West Highland White Terrier, consult your veterinarian. They are in the best position to help you choose the right food and feeding plan for your pup's individual needs.",
        "exercise": "The West Highland White Terrier has a high energy level, but their exercise needs are easily met. They're typically content with daily 30-minute walks, as long as they're given plenty of opportunity to sniff and investigate. (Some may call them nosy, but Westies prefer to call it \"interested in life.\") But make sure they're on leash if not in an enclosed space; if a critter wanders by, those hunting instincts will kick in, and they'll take off after it. And with their surprisingly fast speed, it could take a while before you finally catch up.\n\nWesties also love to romp around and play. That strong desire to chase can often be channeled into a hearty game of fetch (though your arm will likely tire out before your dog does). Dog sports and dog shows are another great outlet for the Westie's abundant energy; they tend to excel at events like agility and rally (which tests their obedience skills), too.\n\nIf you don't give them the exercise they need, they'll find their own entertainment. They may chase small animals, dig in your yard or just bark their heads off. Dog sports that play to their nature, like barn hunts and earthdog competitions are ideal. (Earthdog is where dogs hunt for small critters underground—but don't worry; the critters are kept safe from the dogs.) You may also want to fill a kiddie pool with sand to give your dog an \"approved\" place to dig to their hearts content.\n\nWith their amazing intellect, don't forget to engage their brains to keep them stimulated. Teach them new tricks like play dead, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-commands-shake-a-paw\"\u003Eshake\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-training-tips-how-to-teach-your-dog-to-roll-over\"\u003Eroll over\u003C/a\u003E and play games like hide-and-seek to get them working their minds. You can also leave a few \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E around the house for them to solve and get a yummy treat as their reward.",
        "ideal_environment": "West Highland White Terriers can thrive in a variety of settings, but only when provided with outlets for their abundant energy and strong intellect. Pet parents must commit to daily training and exercise, or your Westie will end up ruling the roost.\r\n\r\nWhile they are highly energetic, the exercise needs for this dog can be kept in check with robust daily walks and yard or park exercise. While they'd certainly enjoy romping around in a large backyard (who doesn't?), it's not required; Westies can be perfectly content in either an apartment or single-family home. The only challenge with apartment living is the Westie's tendency to bark, something your neighbors might not enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen properly trained and socialized, Westies make great family dogs, especially with older kids. The Westie breed has a strong desire to chase prey, so they might end up chasing your kids and cats unless they're taught good canine behavior at an early age. Children in the household also might need a bit of training; people assume all small dogs like to be picked up and coddled, but not the Westie. If a child (or any other person) insists on handling them against the Westie's will, your dog may react.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Westies have a lifespan of 13 to 15 years and are generally regarded as a healthy breed, thanks in large part to responsible breeding practices.

This condition can be seen in both puppies and dogs with symptoms including lameness, “bunny hopping” gait, difficulty standing, running, jumping, difficulty getting up from rest, climbing stairs and even pain/vocalization as it progresses. Early diagnosis is helpful to focus on limiting pain and the progression of arthritis of the joint. Use of medications (pain management and anti-inflammatories), exercise or physical therapy, joint support supplements and diet, can help support the joint, and surgical interventions are used in severe cases.

        "h2_breed_history": "The West Highland White Terrier origin traces back to Scotland where they were bred to hunt rats and other vermin. For hundreds of years, the Westie and other small terriers were used in homes and on farms to keep the pest populations under control. While we don't know exactly when the Westie got their start, there's evidence of their existence dating back to the 1500 to 1600s.\r\n\r\nThe typical Westie traits come from their history as rat hunters. With their sharp intellect, high energy, strong prey drive, high speed and powerful sense of smell, farmers and landholders were able to train Westies to track, chase and eliminate vermin. Their brash confidence helped in the hunt, too; Westies refused to back down when faced with their prey, regardless of their size.\r\n\r\nThe West Highland White Terrier began their second career as show dogs later in their history. Even though they'd been around for hundreds of years, their first official showing didn't occur until 1896 at a Scottish dog show. Just 10 years later, in 1906, Westies made their first appearance at an American Kennel Club show. The first official AKC registration of a West Highland White Terrier soon followed in 1908.\r\n\r\nOften a favorite of dog show judges, the Westie has also enjoyed mainstream popularity. The breed has consistently ranked in the top third of all dog breeds in the United States. Thanks to the breed's popularity, Westie breeders are abundant with the current cost of a puppy ranging from $1,500 to $2,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
