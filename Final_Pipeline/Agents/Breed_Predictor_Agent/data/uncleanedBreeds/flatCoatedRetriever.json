        "training": "Flat-Coated Retriever dogs are friendly and enthusiastic, and they can grow to be quite large. Starting with positive reinforcement training (aka rewarding good behavior with treats, toys or praise) and focusing on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eleash manners\u003C/a\u003E and how to politely greet people when your dog is a puppy will be helpful as your dog grows. Flat-Coated Retrievers also tend to mature slowly, which means some puppy-like behaviors may carry on well into their adulthood. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003ETraining\u003C/a\u003E can help them learn what's acceptable and what's, well, not.\n\nWith the Flat-Coated Retriever's high level of intelligence and their history of being bred to work with their humans, you've got a dog who needs plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. Training can help with this, and enrichment and exercise like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/sp/puzzle-feeders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efood puzzles\u003C/a\u003E and nosework games can keep your dog engaged and entertained.\n\nThis breed tends to be highly sensitive, so it's even more important to make sure to use positive reinforcement training. Punishing a behavior can be scary and painful for a dog, and if a dog doesn't take corrections well, this type of training can break the dog's confidence and result in lifelong, fear-based behavior problems. Instead, work with a trainer who specializes in positive reinforcement and who can set your dog up for success.\n\nBe sure to start \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocializing\u003C/a\u003E your Flat-Coated Retriever (aka introducing them to new people and experiences) while they're a puppy to help reinforce their naturally friendly nature. Take them on walks and let them meet new people and other dogs. Puppy school is a great way to start socializing your pup. They'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\n\nFlat-Coated Retrievers are people-lovers at their core, but they can sometimes express that love in undesirable ways. For example, they have a tendency to jump on people when greeting them, which is well-intentioned but not ideal, given their larger size and height. Training can help curb their enthusiasm and teach them to greet new friends in a more socially acceptable way—perhaps a paw-shake and a vigorous tail-wag?",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Flat-Coated Retriever typically does well on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or a senior.\n\nHighly active dogs, like many Flat-Coated Retrievers, will benefit from a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/3-types-of-dogs-who-could-benefit-from-a-high-protein-dog-food\"\u003Ehigh-protein diet\u003C/a\u003E. If your dog loves to run and play, they may need this higher protein content. Dogs who are quieter and don't participate lots of athletic activity won't need this extra protein, and they could gain unnecessary weight on a high-protein diet. Consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right high-quality dog food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "To keep them happy and healthy, Flat-Coated Retrievers need at least 90 minutes of exercise a day. A fenced-in yard can give your dog plenty of running room, but they'll also benefit from plenty of time hiking, swimming and exploring with you. All those trail maps you've been hoarding? Time to put them to good use.\r\n\r\nBecause this breed has a high energy level, getting them started in dog sports can give them another way to burn off energy. (As an added bonus, it's a great way for your Flat-Coated Retriever to spend time with their favorite person—you!) This breed's speed makes them well-suited for sports like dock diving and agility. Their sensitive noses are perfect for scentwork and tracking. Your dog might also love obedience and rally sports—anything that keeps their paws and nose active!",
        "ideal_environment": "Their high energy and larger size means that Flat-Coated Retrievers do best in larger homes or even a farm, where there is space to run and roam with an active pet parent. They can fit into smaller homes and apartments as long as there is a fenced-in yard or other outlet that provides them plenty of exercise.\r\n\r\nThanks to their friendly and eager-to-please nature, the Flat-Coated Retriever tends to form strong bonds with their pet parents and loves to be surrounded by family. They get along great with kids, other dogs and, yes, even cats (when properly trained and socialized). Still, it's still important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nThis breed loves people, and most Flat-Coated Retrievers will happily meet your guests at the door with an enthusiastic tail wag. Just remember this breed can go a little overboard in their exuberant greetings by jumping on guests, so social households that enjoy throwing parties will want to make sure they can keep their Flat-Coated Retriever's greetings in check.\r\n\r\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever puppy is slow to mature, and their puppy-like behaviors may continue for years. For that reason, this breed is best-suited for experienced pet parents with a sense of humor. These dogs tend to be good-natured but a bit mischievous—your favorite pair of shoes may quickly become chew toys, and your energetic dog will try to turn anything into a game of fetch—so it's important that a family can think ahead, puppy-proof a house (even for an adult dog) and laugh off the dog's antics.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Flat-Coated Retriever's origins began in Britain in the 1800s. The breed was heavily influenced by the St. John's Dog and Setter. The Flat-Coated Retriever's coat was one of their most notable characteristics, and it was developed to help protect the dog from rain, brush and other elements they would face when out hunting.\r\n\r\nFlat-Coated Retrievers were bred to be easily trainable and to be physically suited to the hunt field. They accompanied hunters while duck hunting, swimming out to fetch the ducks that had been shot.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were initially highly popular. They did well in dog shows and field trials. Initially, the black-coated dogs were valued more highly, but the liver-colored dogs became more popular in the 1900s. However, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolden Retriever\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ELabrador Retriever\u003C/a\u003E were also recognized as separate breeds, and these breeds gradually surpassed the Flat-Coated Retriever in popularity. The American Kennel Club (AKC) officially recognized the Flat-Coated Retriever in 1915.\r\n\r\nWhile Flat-Coated Retrievers had been highly popular with gamekeepers and hunters, World War II resulted in challenges like food shortages and limited transportation, causing the breed's numbers to decline. After the World Wars, breeders turned their attention to preserving the breed and their history, which they did successfully. Since then, selective breeding has helped to restore this unique breed, and today, the Flat-Coated Retriever is popular as both a hunting and family dog.\r\n\r\nYou can find Flat-Coated Retriever puppies from reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/flat-coated-retriever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average Flat-Coated Retriever puppy price varies from $2,000-$3,000. For that price, you're usually getting a puppy who has been screened for potential health problems and temperament issues, and your puppy might have pedigree papers. You can also reach out to local shelters to see if there is a Flat-Coated Retriever to adopt.",
