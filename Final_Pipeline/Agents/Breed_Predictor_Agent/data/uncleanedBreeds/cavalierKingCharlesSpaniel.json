(Consider it cotillion for your extroverted pup.) Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies are smart and easy to train.

Both treats and toys are tools that will encourage your pup to respond positively to different training commands. As true companion pups, Cavaliers always aspire to please their pet parents and will generally pick up various commands and tricks with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Cavaliers are mostly relaxed and incredibly friendly with just about anyone they meet, they do have a \"teenager\" phase. When they hit puberty at around 6-8 months old, they become more distant and timid around people. If you notice this change, don't push them to socialize—you may end up reinforcing this unwanted behavior. Temporarily adjust walks, so you have more alone time. Then, plan walks where people your pup knows well cross your path; chat for a bit, but don't interact with your pup. (Your friend should drop a tasty treat.) Over time, your Cavalier should respond to your friends positively and take a treat from their hand. Eventually, your Cavalier will return to their playful ways.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause they're smart and savvy, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels do well in canine sports, such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/sports/rally/get-started/\"\u003Erally\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E.

        "diet_nutrition": "\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels should eat high-quality food specifically designed for the life stage they're currently in, whether puppy, adult or senior—age is a key factor in determining diet.

Follow the recommended portions to help make sure you don't feed your pup too much. If your pup has added a few extra pounds, your vet can help you put together a meal plan and exercise regimen that provides the nutrients your dog needs and helps them lose the extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile treats are a good way to reward your pup in training or for being a very good pup, remember to do so in moderation. (Treat calories count!)

        "exercise": "\u003Cp\u003ECompared to other breeds, Cavaliers have a moderate energy level and minimal exercise needs. One or two 20- to 30-minute walks a day with playtime and obedience training is sufficient (about one hour total). The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel descends from sporting dogs (dogs bred to hunt), so they do enjoy outside activities. (They love to snuggle, but they are not couch potatoes!) They love taking long walks with their family (they are not known for their speed), and do well in canine sports, such as obedience, rally and agility.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you're on a walk or at the park, keep your dog on the leash at all times. If something catches their attention, they could run off and not return when called. (Their hunting and scenting instincts run deep.) Consider using a harness, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/puppia-vest-polyester-step-in-back/dp/121558\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPuppia vest step-in dog harness\u003C/a\u003E because it's easy to put on and take off.

        "ideal_environment": "\u003Cp\u003ECavaliers are extremely adaptable. Because they love being so close to their families, they thrive in all sorts of settings, from small apartments to large houses. If you have a home, a fenced yard is recommended, so your dog doesn't run off when they see—or smell!—something interesting. However, if you have an affinity for the Great Outdoors, they're probably more suited to spend time in an RV than a tent. (They are totally up for glamping, though!) Grab a cozy dog bed for them, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/best-friends-by-sheri-original/dp/172572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe Original Calming shag fur donut cuddler\u003C/a\u003E, and they'll be more than ready to snuggle up no matter where you are.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is truly a breed for anyone, whether you are single or have a family with kids and babies. If you're the outgoing type who keeps a packed calendar and wants a constant companion, Cavaliers are happy to tag long. But if you're a couch potato who prefers to stay at home and catch up on your streaming queue, they'll happily snuggle next to you and be thrilled with whatever show you choose.

        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EWith a name as regal as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel's, it's not the least bit surprising the breed has a royal history. They're named after King Charles I, a 17th-century British monarch who evidently had several toy spaniels who accompanied him almost everywhere. He and his son, Charles II, had black and tan varieties, which have been around since at least the Renaissance times in Europe. Originally bred to be a bird hunter, their small, short stature and demeanor made them better suited to be companions and affectionate lap dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECavaliers were extremely popular among the noble classes and remained a go-to breed for aristocrats in the United Kingdom until the early 19th century. The Marlborough family was very involved with breeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace, turning their focus on the chestnut and white variety. During Queen Victoria's reign, the breed was mixed with Asian toy breeds, such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPugs\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/japanese-chin/\"\u003EJapanese Chins\u003C/a\u003E. This cross-breeding changed the breed's look and structure, evolving into a shape with a domed skull and flatter face than the dogs Charles I had. In fact, Charles' dogs came close to extinction as this new variety dominated.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1920s, people wanted the dogs portrayed in the old portraits of their ancestors. Roswell Eldridge, a wealthy American, challenged British breeders to breed Blenheim Spaniels \"of the Old World type.\" To win a cash prize, the breeders worked to bring back the old look—and they did. That's when the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was born. Where did the \"cavalier\" come from? The army that supported Charles I in the English Civil War was called Cavaliers, and thus we get \"Cavalier\" in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Cavalier became an American Kennel Club-recognized breed in 1995 and is the 14th most popular breed in America. It's no wonder why—Cavaliers are highly prized for their affectionate and adaptable temperament. (And they're so darn cute!) If you're looking to add a Cavalier as a pet, you can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. A Cavalier puppy can cost between $1,800-$3,500. But for that price, you usually get a pup who's been screened for health issues and may include pedigree papers. Or, you can check with local Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rescue organizations, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-cavalier-king-charles-spaniel_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.\u003C/p\u003E",
