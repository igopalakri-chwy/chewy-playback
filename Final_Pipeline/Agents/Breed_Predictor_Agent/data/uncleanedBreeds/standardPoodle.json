        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the Poodle is often associated with France, this breed actually originated from a different part of Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStandard Poodles were bred in Germany to retrieve waterfowl for duck hunters, which explains why today’s Poodles are such \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/dogs-that-love-to-swim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eexcellent swimmers\u003C/a\u003E. Their name comes from the German verb \u003Cem\u003Epúddeln,\u003C/em\u003E which means “to splash.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Standard Poodle’s well-recognized haircut is rooted in the breed’s past as a water retriever. To keep them nimble and efficient in the water, the coat needed to be kept short. Long hair all around “would have tired them out and made it more likely they would drown,” Alexander says.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe hair that’s left behind in the classic Standard Poodle cut was there to provide strategic warmth during and after an outing. “We shaved the rear end so they could use those strong rear legs to tread water,” Alexander says. “We kept the big hair—their mane—to help them be buoyant, but also keep their heart and lungs warm.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Standard Poodle is so smart, Alexander says this breed has had a variety of occupations, from circus performers to truffle hunters. Over centuries, smaller versions of the Standard Poodle have emerged: the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/miniature-poodle\"\u003EMiniature Poodle\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/toy-poodle\"\u003EToy Poodle\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStandard Poodle puppies typically cost between $2,500–$4,000.
