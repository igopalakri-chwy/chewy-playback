They have a strong, self-confident personality and need a firm hand when training. At the same time, however, they're loyal and loving—happy to spend time with your family on the couch or going for a long walk. Young Bouviers can be rowdy or destructive, but the breed typically mellows out as they age (Bouviers are considered fully grown by the time they're 2 or 3 years old).\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres is a working dog, happiest when they're herding a group of cattle or guarding your home to keep your family safe. Bred to help out with various jobs around a farm, today's Bouviers are equally as happy acting as police dogs or service dogs. Don't be afraid to give your Bouvier a job in your household—that's exactly what they want. (And that laundry isn't going to fold itself, after all.)\r\n\r\nBouvier des Flandres tend to do well with kids, especially if they grow up alongside them. But Bouviers don't always get along with other animals; they can be dominant over other dogs, and their high prey drive may interfere with their relationship with cats. Slow introductions and setting firm boundaries can help improve a Bouvier's relationship with other pets. To people outside your family, Bouviers' traits may show up as reserved or aloof (that's where those guard dog tendencies come in). But to the members of your household, a Bouvier will be affectionate and loyal to the end.",

Their strong personality, however, can sometimes make them difficult to train. A mixture of firm corrections and positive reinforcement is ideal to help them learn. A new dog parent might feel out of their depth with Bouvier des Flandres training, but a more experienced dog parent should be fine.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003ELeash training\u003C/a\u003E is extremely important for Bouviers.

While it's important to practice basic \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience training commands\u003C/a\u003E, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E, make sure you aren't too repetitive or your Bouvier will make their boredom known, acting out with undesirable behaviors.

Because Bouviers are used to working in some capacity, training is extremely important for this breed.",
        "diet_nutrition": "All Bouvier des Flandres need a balanced diet consisting of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/your-complete-guide-to-the-best-high-quality-dog-food\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E that's tailored to their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Bouviers are big and highly active, so they need plenty of fuel to keep them on the go. Three to five cups per day over two servings should suffice, but speak with your veterinarian to select the best amount of food based on your dog's specific needs. Bouviers are also prone to obesity—so as hard as it may be to resist that scruffy face, limit the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/treats-335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etreats\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nExperts recommend that Bouvier puppies are fed a large-breed \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puppy-11097\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuppy food\u003C/a\u003E that has modified protein and calcium/phosphorus levels. This kind of food will help avoid juvenile bone disorders that can occur in some rapidly-growing puppies.",
        "exercise": "The Bouvier des Flandres' exercise needs are high. Experts recommend 60-90 minutes of physical activity daily. This will ensure your Bouvier stays both happy and healthy—Bouviers can easily become overweight, so plenty of exercise helps keep them trim.\n\nAs working dogs, Bouviers des Flandres have lots of energy and stamina. You'll want to put on comfortable shoes if you're heading out for a walk—your Bouvier will be willing to walk much farther than you, and frankly, a basic walk isn't going to suffice for their daily exercise needs. Try going for a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-run-with-dog\"\u003Erun\u003C/a\u003E or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/ready-to-hit-the-hiking-trail-with-your-dog-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\"\u003Ehike\u003C/a\u003E to up the game. Because Bouviers thrive when they have a job to do, you can also incorporate games and activities into your dog's daily exercise routine.

It's important to provide plenty of mental stimulation so your Bouvier doesn't get bored and turn destructive.\n\nAs your dog ages, you can decrease the amount of daily exercise based on their needs. However, gentle exercise is still important to keep them in good physical shape and keep the Bouviers' energy level satisfied. If you have a Bouvier puppy, you'll also want to be mindful of your dog's daily activity. It's important that the Bouvier breed is not overworked while they're young. This allows young Bouviers to develop properly.",
        "ideal_environment": "The Bouvier des Flandres needs plenty of outdoor space to run. A rural or country setting is ideal for this large dog, as is a home with a large yard in which they can speed around. While a Bouvier might be able to adjust to living in a small home or apartment, this isn't ideal—its essential they have ample exercise every day.\r\n\r\nBouviers are good with kids, although it's better if they grow up along with those kids so they view the children as part of their “pack.\" Keep an eye on a Bouvier around kids, and be cautious with small children—while Bouviers don't mean to cause harm, their large stature and herding instinct may cause them to nip at a child's heels while playing or accidentally knock over a toddler. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs. Bouviers can be strong-willed with other dogs and might not be a good fit for households with additional pets. Because Bouviers can be protective, they also tend to be aloof when strangers or company are around (at least, until you give them the go-ahead).\r\n\r\nBouviers will thrive living with an experienced dog parent. Their high level of intelligence and energy requires you to stay ahead of them, or else they'll get ahead of you. The ideal Bouvier parent would live in the country with lots of space for exercise. He or she should also be prepared to set strong boundaries and provide the grooming the dog will need.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Bouvier des Flandres was first bred in Belgium in the late 1800s. While their exact origin is not entirely clear, experts speculate that \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/standard-schnauzer/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESchnauzers\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/beauceron/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBeaucerons\u003C/a\u003E, local farm dogs, and potentially \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/irish-wolfhound/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EIrish Wolfhounds\u003C/a\u003E and Scottish Deerhounds were bred to create the Bouvier as we know them today. Farmers used the Bouvier as drovers (cattle herds), guard dogs and draft animals (to pull carts). Essentially, Bouviers would take on any job that needed to be done around the farm. An official breed standard was established for the Bouvier in 1912.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s, war was brewing in Europe and smart, strong Bouviers were sometimes used to pull ambulances and carry guns and messages during World War I. The dogs who made it through the war were taken to other countries—and that's how the Bouvier eventually ended up in America in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres breed also served during World War II. The Resistance in Holland used Bouviers to carry messages at night. A fun Bouvier fact is that later in the 20th century, this breed became popular among royalty and presidential leadership: Ronald and Nancy Reagan had a Bouvier named Lucky, and a Bouvier police dog named Jango was sometimes used to guard Princess Diana.\r\n\r\nThe Bouvier des Flandres was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1929. Today, they're ranked as “somewhat popular\" according to the breed's AKC rating. Not everyone has heard of the Bouvier des Flandres, but those who have are staunchly devoted to the breed. If you're wondering about the average Bouvier cost, you can expect to pay $1,500-$2,000 for a Bouvier des Flandres puppy.
