        "h2_breed_temperament": "The Welsh Terrier dog breed is affectionate with the people they love. They're outgoing, spirited and highly alert. No wallflowers here! On the flip side, they'll likely chase and bark after any little critter that moves.\n\nWelshies are not naturally aggressive, nor do they have strong biting tendencies. But as a hunting breed, untrained dogs (and sometimes even the trained ones) will chase after small animals, including cats, and fight back if challenged by other dogs. Pro tip: If buying or adopting two dogs at once, getting one of each gender may result in a smoother transition.\n\nA Welsh Terrier's fun-loving temperament can make them great pets who can co-exist beautifully with active parents. Raising a Welshie with kids is more of a mixed bag. The best chance for happy cohabitation depends on the young children's age at the time the dog enters the home (older than 6 is your best bet), and whether you provide diligent supervision and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E—both for your dog, and to teach your children how to respectfully interact with them.\n\nA medium- or large-sized home with plenty of indoor and outdoor space—a big fenced yard, for example—to speed around in is ideal. They definitely need room to get the zoomies out. Small apartment living can also work, as long as you give your pup plenty of outdoor opportunities to race. But be warned: Due to their high energy and natural hunting tendencies, Welshies tend to jump on furniture to make room for play. They should always be on a leash when out in public, too.\n\nThis breed isn't the best choice for first-time dog parents as Welsh Terriers' intelligence and high energy levels demand above-average physical exercise as well as a ton of training and mental stimulation for them to thrive. Regardless, if a Welsh Terrier puppy has already won your heart, make sure they come from a reputable breeder and invest in a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/find-a-dog-trainer\"\u003Ecertified trainer\u003C/a\u003E to end up with the best Welsh Terrier qualities and a devoted forever friend.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "The Welsh Terrier breed may look like a huggable, wiry-haired stuffed prize you won at the fair, yet surprisingly, they don't need a lot of brushing to keep them looking their cuddly best. They do, however, require plenty of daily activities and mental stimulation, a balanced diet, plus regular nail trimming and teeth brushing routines to keep them happy and healthy for a lifetime.",
        "grooming": "Don't be fooled by their scruffy appearance; in comparison to other double-coated breeds, the Welsh Terrier hardly ever sheds a wiry curl and is considered a hypoallergenic breed. Regular brushing with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Elong-bristled pin brush\u003C/a\u003E and three or four annual professional groomer visits for a haircut and beard trim are all you'll need to keep their coat tidy.\n\nFor a special Welsh Terrier grooming treat, book a hand stripping session where the groomer removes unruly hairs by hand. (This is how the pros prep their Welsh Terriers to compete in dog shows.)\n\nUnless your Welshie has stepped in something foul, bathing them three times a year with a mild shampoo will more than suffice. Between baths, a 50/50 mixture of medicinal mouthwash and water will kill germs and promote healthy skin and coat. Plus, they'll smell good, too.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EClipping your Welsh Terrier's nails\u003C/a\u003E is more than an aesthetic chore. Long nails can cause pain and trigger irreversible damage to your dog. In fact, they can turn a sound paw into a splayed foot, reduce traction, cause deformed feet and even injure the tendons over an extended period. You should trim nails once a month or as needed. When you hear them tapping on the floor, it's time to trim! If your dog fidgets, a groomer might prefer to grind the nails to sand them down slowly.\n\nLike most dogs who enjoy spending time exploring outdoors, Welsh Terriers need regular ear inspections—once a week is a good bet— to keep them clear and free from infection. If you see redness, swelling or debris, call your vet. They may advise you to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean your dog's ears\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nWelshie \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eteeth need brushing\u003C/a\u003E daily (best to start from puppyhood, so they get used to toothbrushing early) with a proper \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/toothbrushes-2597\"\u003Etoothbrush\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/toothpastes-2598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog toothpaste\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/best-bully-sticks-thick-12-bully/dp/129442\"\u003EBest Bully 12-inch sticks\u003C/a\u003E are both entertaining for your pet and will keep their molars clean. Finally, keep their teeth in top form and avoid tooth disease and decay with annual teeth cleanings at the vet.",
        "training": "Quick-learning and alert, but with a ridiculously high prey drive (we can't stress this enough), Welsh Terriers need significant amounts of obedience training to resist going after potential prey.\r\n\r\nPositive reinforcement methods (treats, toys and praise for a job well done) tend to work well for the easily distracted Welshie. So the first step after bringing home your Welsh Terrier puppy should be to hire a certified trainer who can motivate your dog and set them up for success.\r\n\r\nDespite being the friendliest of all the dogs in the Terrier group, these furry friends are also the most sensitive, with an attention span that wanes pretty quickly. Therefore, you need to commit to short but effective Welsh Terrier training sessions, five minutes at a time, multiple times a day.\r\n\r\nSocialization, aka introducing your dog to new people and experiences, is important to bring out the naturally friendly qualities of your Welshie. Start taking your puppy on walks around the neighborhood to meet new friends and enroll in puppy preschool where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\r\n\r\nUltimately, success will depend on your dog's unique personality combined with your ability to exude confidence. Your Welshie loves you, but make no mistake, they will try to run your household if you let them. If all else fails, thank goodness for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/leashes-346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esturdy dog leashes\u003C/a\u003E and a giant dose of patience. It's a virtue, you know.",
        "diet_nutrition": "A healthy Welsh Terrier's food diet consists of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E and thankfully, there are plenty of great options available. Before buying, be sure to factor in your dog's lifestyle and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior).\r\n\r\nDespite their active life, Welsh Terrier weight can easily increase if their diet is not carefully monitored. The struggle is real, even for dogs, it seems. Therefore, a high-protein, well-balanced diet will best suit their needs once or twice per day. At snack time, be creative with low-calorie treats—ice cubes are a favorite. But remember, healthy is best. Carrots, anyone?\r\n\r\nOverall, to keep them in tip-top shape and add years to your Welsh Terrier's lifespan, be sure to consult with your veterinarian about your diet or weight concerns. After all, a professional is in the best position to determine the perfect diet and lifestyle to meet your dog's unique dietary needs.",
        "exercise": "Welsh Terrier energy levels are sky-high, particularly when young. They're not the type of dog you can take on a brisk walk around the block then leave alone to snooze the afternoon away. Welshies benefit from lots of exercise and, when supervised—that is, on a long line or in a fenced area—they should be allowed to practice the hunting-related activities (i.e., flushing out and chasing vermin) for which they were bred.\n\nTo stay out of trouble, Welshies must be busy. You know what they say about idle hands (or, in this case, idle paws). They'll find a rousing game of backyard \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E or Frisbee toss particularly entertaining. They also can't get enough of toys that squeak (perhaps reminding them of prey). Toy brands that can hold up to a Welshie's strong teeth include \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/brands/kong-6981#rh=PetType:Dog,ProductCategory:Toys\"\u003EKong Toys\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/brands/jw-pet-6949\"\u003EJW Pet Toys\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/brands/outward-hound-7188?nav-submit-button=&amp;ref=searchRedirect&amp;ref-query=outward%20hound\"\u003EOutward Hound. \u003C/a\u003EApart from casual playtime, Welsh Terriers excel at dog sports, including rally (similar to obedience courses), \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E, lure coursing and barn hunt.",
        "ideal_environment": "As with most breeds, Welsh Terriers can get along with kids and other dogs provided they have all been raised together from a young age and with consistent training. Still, there's always the possibility their strong prey drive will show up—so you might want to cancel those plans to babysit your sister's new kitty. For a Welshie, the best-case scenario would be to live with active singles, couples or families ready to keep a close eye on their pet.\r\n\r\nTheir ideal living situation would be in a large house or farm with plenty of yard space for the fun, frolicking freedom to be their impish selves.\r\n\r\nThe perfect match for these unpredictable pets is an equally energetic pet parent with the experience, patience and good humor to know when to correct bad behavior with positive reinforcement (aka rewarding their good behavior with treats, toys and praise), and when to let these little clowns get away with harmless larks.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Welsh Terriers have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years and, in general, are a healthy breed. Still, Welshies can be prone to a number of health problems.

        "h2_breed_history": "Welsh Terrier origins date back to the 1700s. Originally bred to mercilessly hunt and kill vermin, including rodents, foxes, otters and badgers, Welshies later ran in dog packs during fox hunts and were eventually primed to compete in dog shows.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh Terrier's history of having a hardwired instinct to chase small prey is still a large part of the modern Welsh Terrier personality. They excel at keeping pests at bay on a farm, but at home, they are affectionate pets who adore spending time with their loved ones or chasing pests in the yard.\r\n\r\nThings got official for the Welsh Terrier during the 19th century. The Kennel Club in London, United Kingdom, recognized Welsh Terriers as a breed in 1887 and, following the first exports in 1885, the American Kennel Club gave Welshies full recognition in 1888.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find the Welsh Terrier breed today?

They are considered hypoallergenic dogs, meaning they produce very little dander, those pesky skin flecks causing most allergic reactions to canines. As a result, many people who experience bad allergic reactions to other dogs live in perfect harmony with a Welsh Terrier. Hooray!\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Welsh Terriers good family dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\nUnder the right circumstances, Welsh Terriers can be good family dogs. They are fun-loving and social, but they have an intense prey drive, so they may need extra supervision, training and socialization when joining families with small children and/or small pets, like cats.\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow long do Welsh Terriers live?\u003C/h3\u003E\nWelsh Terriers have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years with the ideal diet, social, physical and mental conditions.\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow big do Welsh Terriers get?\u003C/h3\u003E\nThe Welsh Terrier doesn't get very big; they're a small-sized dog, about 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs about 20 pounds—small enough to join you in some plane cabins but too big to carry in a tote bag.\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Welsh Terriers bark a lot?\u003C/h3\u003E\nWelsh Terriers do bark, but there's usually a reason for it. Their alertness and high prey drive make them quick to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound.
