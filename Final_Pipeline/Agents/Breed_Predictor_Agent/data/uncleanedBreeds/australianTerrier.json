They are the type of pup to keep their family entertained, but they'll get into mischief (aka chewing things, excessive barking) if they aren't sufficiently exercised or if they're left alone for too long. Because Aussies were bred to be companions, in addition to keeping vermin, like rats, off the farm, they bond strongly with their families and can get very attached to humans. If you're someone with a busy travel or work schedule, the Australian Terrier might not be the breed for you.\r\n\r\nDespite their devotion to their pet parents, this isn't your happy-go-lucky \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\"\u003EGolden Retriever\u003C/a\u003E who'll bound up to strangers and lick their face.

But socialization, starting when they're a puppy, will help them get used to meeting new people and situations.\r\n\r\nAustralian Terriers do best as the only dog in your home. Because they were bred to hunt vermin, small pets, like cats and bunnies, will be high on their list of things to chase—best to keep them in a home without any kitties or critters.\r\n\r\nDue to their intelligence and innate desire to hunt prey, these dogs are strong-willed and independent thinkers. They have the terrier characteristics to want to be the leader, but with the right approach and experienced pet parents, they can be well-trained.",

This dog's coat is more than just for looks—the Australian Terrier uses their coat for protection. In the Australian Outback, the longer hair around their neck protects them against snake bites when nosing around in the brush, so their neck ruff should be left intact. Their coat also acts as a defense against the elements.

Sometimes small dogs are just harder to train; they have small bladders and need to go out more often, and their potty time cues may not be as instantly recognizable as a larger dog's. Consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them when they potty outside. (Be sure to use the same cue words, like “Let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.)\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-how-to-make-crate-training-easy-for-your-pet-and-you\"\u003ECrate training\u003C/a\u003E is a great way to help potty train your puppy.

Starting while they're a puppy, take your dog on walks and let them sniff and meet new people and other friendly dogs. Enroll in puppy preschool, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and interact with other pup parents all in one location.\n\nOne characteristic you might need to work on with your Australian Terrier is excessive barking. It's natural for them to bark at visitors, strangers or other dogs, but you can teach them to know when to bark and when to keep their thoughts to themselves. It's important to remember that, while you can teach your pup to curb their natural instincts, like barking and chasing, you'll never train these traits completely out of your dog.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Because Australian Terriers are so active, it's important to feed them a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E that sustains them on those long walks and chase sessions in the yard. Be sure to choose a formula that fits their age and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Talk to your veterinarian about the best food and feeding schedule for your individual dog.\r\n\r\nOne topic of conversation that might come up with older dog is obesity—something many small dogs struggle with as they age. It's important not to overfeed your Australian Terrier, as obesity can limit their mobility and lead to other health issues down the road like heart disease.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably go through quite a few treats during obedience training, but remember that treats equal calories. Instead of always rewarding your pup with food, give your dog playtime with a special toy you only use during training or give them a massage.\r\n\r\nWhen feeding your Australian Terrier, watch out for food sensitivities and allergies. If you notice your dog isn't doing well with a particular food—symptoms may include itching, vomiting or diarrhea—consult your vet right away. They can help you determine what's causing your pup's symptoms and the best course of action, whether that's a change in food or medication.",
        "exercise": "The Australian Terrier's short legs may lead you to believe they prefer a short stroll down the sidewalk to a mountain hike, but don't underestimate these energetic and adventurous dogs. Plan on 60-90 minutes of exercise throughout the day.\n\nThey need vigorous exercise and play sessions several times a day, whether that takes the form of a long walk in the woods, an off-leash romp in a fenced yard or a rousing game of hide-and-seek. Australian Terriers play well with older kids and young children they're already comfortable with and will run circles around them for days before tiring themselves out.\n\nIt's important to keep these pups on a leash if you're not in an enclosed area, like a fenced backyard. These dogs have a very high prey drive and will chase when they see something that needs chasing. So, for their safety and your mental well-being, keep them on a leash when out and about.\n\nAustralian Terriers are smart cookies; be sure to engage their brains as well as their bodies. You may want to participate in dog sports, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, or give them a job to do, like pick up their toys or socks or shoes left lying around the house.

        "ideal_environment": "Australian Terriers love a home where they can run around to their heart's content, making a home with a fenced yard they can speed around on their Top 10 list. Their compact size makes them ideal for apartments, but you'll need to be able to give them the abundant exercise they need every day. Without it, they'll annoy your neighbors as they sing the song of their people. All. Day. Long.\r\n\r\nAustralian Terriers are active little pups who love adventure; they will not be happy left at home with their thoughts. And because they're so active and think they're pretty smart, they're better suited for pet parents who have experience training dogs.\r\n\r\nThese pups have an affinity for both children and the elderly. They can be very gentle with kids, particularly if they're introduced to them as puppies. While they prefer to be the only dog in the home, Australian Terriers can get along with other dogs if raised together.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Australian Terrier hails from Australia (no surprise there!), but this dog owes their origins to the British settlers who brought working terriers \"Down Under.\" The development of this breed started around 1820, when they were called Rough Coated Terriers; they became known as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The breed's ancestors include the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/norwich-terrier/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENorwich Terrier\u003C/a\u003E, the Scottish Terrier and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/yorkshire-terrier/\"\u003EYorkshire Terrier\u003C/a\u003E. The word \"terrier,\" from \u003Cem\u003Eterre\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Etera\u003C/em\u003E, the French and Latin words for earth, refers to these dogs' tendency to burrow.\n\nLike other prey-driven dogs, including the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECairn Terrier\u003C/a\u003E and Dandie Dinmont, the Australian Terrier was (and still is!) adept at hunting rats, mice and snakes on farms and homesteads. Their double coats protected them against the extreme temperatures of the Australian Outback, while the long hair on their necks and chests defended against snake bites. These dogs were keen and fearless hunters, and their instinct to hunt small animals remains to this day.\n\nIn spite of their hunting prowess, and unlike some terrier breeds, Australian Terriers had a dual purpose: they were also bred to be companion dogs. While they worked hard at their outdoor jobs, they were equally happy to keep farm families company inside the home. The Australian Terrier was Australia's first officially recognized dog and was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1960, having first been introduced to the US in the 1940s.\n\nIf you want one of these dogs in your life, the price for a purebred Australian Terrier puppy can range $1,300-$1,500 or more. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/australian-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E.
