This chill dog doesn't need a lot of exercise or grooming—but pay attention their skin folds to prevent infection and keep a towel to clean up their drooling. The bulk of your time will be spent in training this powerful, large-breed pooch.",
      "grooming": "With their size and hallmark wrinkly nature, plan on brushing your Neapolitan Mastiff dog with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E two or three times a week to keep their shedding under control. While you're brushing your pup, be sure to clean their folds, especially around the face. Drool, dirt and food can accumulate, causing infection if not taken care of. And don't forget to check their ears for debris, redness and swelling. If you notice anything unusual, contact your vet, who may recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Ecleaning their ears\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nDepending on their activity level, a bath every four to six weeks will keep their coat shiny and smelling fresh. Bathtime is a good time to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Etrim their nails\u003C/a\u003E. (The bath softens the nails, making them easier to clip.) You'll know they're ready for a trim when you can hear them clacking on hard surfaces.\n\nWhen it comes to your Mastino's pearly whites, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrush their teeth\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;daily. It's best to start the habit when your Neapolitan Mastiff's a puppy, so they get used to it sooner. Otherwise, your gentle giant will be at risk for health problems like gum disease. And an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not your groomer) is mandatory.",
      "training": "Neapolitan Mastiffs are intelligent dogs who learn best with patience, consistency and positivity. So be sure to reward your pup with treats, praise and fun playtimes when they do a good job. Mastino puppies are very energetic, while the adults are very laid back. But their adolescent years? These pups can be a bit strong-willed and will try to tell you their way of doing things is better than yours. And this is why it's a good idea to start training early; you want to have your pup trusting your leadership long before they weigh well over 100 pounds!\n\nOne of the best parts of training a Neapolitan Mastiff puppy is that you don't need to reinvent the wheel or make a game of everything. They have a natural desire to please you, so they do well with repetition. It's important to focus on a few behaviors (or even just one) at a time and aim for simplicity and perfection. (For example, instead of teaching \"\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E,\" teach a really long \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E that outlasts distractions with ease.)\n\nDon't forget socialization! It's super important for these pups. These dogs can be wary of strangers—they were originally bred to be guard dogs—so it's important you start socializing your dog while they're a puppy. Take them on walks and let them see other people and dogs, and enroll them in puppy school. Puppy school is a great place to learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet people outside their family.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Neapolitan Mastiffs thrive on high-quality, large-breed \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/the-ages-and-stages-of-dog-food-from-puppy-to-adult-to-senior\"\u003Edog food\u003C/a\u003E designed for their age (puppy, adult or senior). These pups grow fast, so be sure you don't add extra calcium (either bone meal or other supplements) to their diet—it could hinder bone development.\n\nMastinos eat a lot, up to six cups of food a day, and it can be easy to overfeed these pups. Even on large dogs, a few extra pounds can add health problems down the road, like arthritis. As you balance your pup's meals and exercise, don't forget to include the treats you give in that ratio. Those calories count. If you notice your pup's a little portly, chat with your vet. They can help you put together a mealtime and exercise plan to help your dog lose the extra weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
      "exercise": "Neapolitan Mastiffs have lower exercise needs than other dogs their size. They enjoy daily walks lumbering throughout the neighborhood, the local park or short nature trails that offer the space they need to move their big bodies. These dogs are not known for their speed, so jogging with you is out of the question. (Besides, it's hard on their joints.) Plan on giving them about 30 to 40 minutes of exercise every day. Neos don't do well in the heat, so be sure to keep their walks to the cooler parts of the day.\r\n\r\nA Neapolitan Mastiff puppy is as energetic as other puppies and loves to play, but rough play can inadvertently damage their bones. So, make sure they don't jump off furniture or play too roughly. And while games of tug-of-war or wrestling are cute when they're little, this dog will grow to outweigh some adults (and definitely be stronger than them, too). So, don't get your puppy in the habit of playing these types of games while they're young. (Or, you'll regret it as they grow up.)",
      "ideal_environment": "Neapolitan Mastiffs are a giant breed, and their quiet, adaptable nature suits medium-to-large-sized homes. Apartments may be OK if they're spacious and you don't have a lot of stairs (and bonus points if there's an elevator).\r\n\r\nMastinos are ideal for experienced pup parents and families with children, as long as both dog and kids have been taught to interact safely and respectfully. Their sheer size and power make them less-than-ideal for newbie dog parents.\r\n\r\nThese pups choose their dog friends carefully, so they may need lots of training and socialization if you're adding them to a home with other dogs. If you raise your Neo from puppyhood with a cat, they are likely to get along.\r\n\r\nNeos prefer colder climates and can overheat when it's hot out, so keep walks to the cooler parts of the day, the AC cranked and fresh water available for your pup to lap up.",

      "h2_breed_history": "The Neapolitan Mastiff's history dates back to Ancient Rome (and maybe as far as 700 B.C.), where their ancestors' strength and girth made them ideal war dogs, gladiators and guards of hearth and home. These original pups (the Molossus) were later bred to be more family-friendly, and the Neapolitan Mastiff came to be. (They are named for Naples, where they originated.)\r\n\r\nBy the 1940s, Neapolitan Mastiffs were nearly extinct, but thanks to a concerted effort by Italian breeders, the Neapolitan Mastiff Renaissance was born. Also known as Neos or Mastinos, Neapolitan Mastiffs were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2004, and included in the Working group, aka the group of dogs bred for a specific job, like guarding or search and rescue.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Mastino to your family? You can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/neapolitan-mastiff\"\u003EAKC website\u003C/a\u003E. Neapolitan Mastiff puppies cost about $1,500 to $2,500 but can exceed $5,000, depending on the lineage. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
