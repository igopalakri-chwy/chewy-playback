With their strong nose skills, they make excellent drug detection dogs and have even found success as therapy dogs, bonding closely to their person.

Training them to keep their prey drive in check is also necessary. You don't want them tracking and chasing every squirrel you meet in a five-mile radius. While you can help curb these innate tendencies, it's important to understand that you'll never completely train them out of your dog. With proper training and lots of exercise, though, you can help your dog be a respectful member of society.\n\nTo bring out the best in your German Wirehaired Pointer puppy, use lots of positive reinforcement during your training times. Toys, treats and praise are great ways to reward your pup. These dogs love to be challenged and rewarded by their pet parents.\n\nAnd don't forget \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E.

Make sure to choose a formula designed for your pup's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). These dogs are known for their high energy and may need a higher calorie or protein intake than other breeds. If you're not sure how often or how much to feed your pup, chat with your vet. They can help you determine a mealtime schedule based on your dog's unique needs and lifestyle.\n\nAnd don't forget the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/treats-335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog treats\u003C/a\u003E!

        "exercise": "If there is one thing German Wirehaired Pointers need more than you, it's, hands down, exercise. They need at least an hour, if not more, of vigorous exercise every day. When these pups aren't properly exercised, unwanted behaviors start to emerge—all that energy has to go somewhere, after all. So, why not destroy your shoes or yell incessantly at that leaf that just blew by? They're working dogs, and they need a job to do. Exercise that stimulates them in both body and mind will scratch their itch for work. It isn't a some-days thing—it's an \u003Ci\u003Eevery\u003C/i\u003Eday thing.\n\nThe German Wirehaired Pointer dog would love it if everything was an exercise in hunting.

Dogs with high prey drives get very focused when they find something they think needs chasing. And they're quick. So, your pup will be off before you realize it, and they won't hear you call, nor will they look both ways before crossing a street. So, for their safety and your sanity, keep them on a leash when you're not in enclosed spaces.\n\nIf you're into some friendly competition, you and your pup should check out dog sports, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, rally (similar to obedience), tracking or \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E.

        "ideal_environment": "While you don't need to own an entire forest to have a German Wirehaired Pointer (though bonus points if you do), these dogs thrive in the outdoors and need a fenced backyard to run around in.\r\n\r\nThey are very affectionate and are ideally suited for active and experienced pet parents who would love to have a companion for any and all outdoor activities. Their high-energy needs paired with their training makes them a great choice for someone who's had a dog before.\r\n\r\nWhile they can be wary of and a little aloof with strangers, these dogs are very family-oriented and bond strongly with their people, including kids.

Other dogs in the German Wirehaired Pointer's genealogy are believed to include the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and Polish water dogs.\r\n\r\nAt first, these dogs were bred simply to keep up with the demand for hunting dogs, but eventually, it transformed into needing a bird dog who could do it all—run through brush, swim through water, stalk through tall grass and more. And because of that, the German Wirehaired Pointer needed a standout feature. Enter their low-maintenance, wiry coat that protects them against the brush and the elements.\r\n\r\nThe breed crossed the pond to the United States in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the German Wirehaired Pointer in 1959 as its 113th breed.\r\n\r\nThinking about adding a German Wirehaired Pointer to your family? You can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/german-wirehaired-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E, where the average German Wirehaired Pointer costs $800-$1,200. For that price, you'll likely get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to German Wirehaired Pointer rescue organizations or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter to adopt a pup.
