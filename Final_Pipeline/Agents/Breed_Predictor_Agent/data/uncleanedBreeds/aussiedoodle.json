These dogs eventually took their sheep-herding skills to Australia and then to California, where ranchers assumed they’d originated from Down Under and dubbed them Australian Shepherds. Since then, Aussies have become common fixtures in Western culture, including cowboy movies and rodeos. \u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPoodles have a similarly muddled origin story, because while they may be the national dog of France, the breed was developed in Germany. Poodles got their start retrieving ducks from icy waters hundreds of years ago, but their noble demeanor and elegant appearance helped spur the transition from hunting dog to household companion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAustralian Shepherds became official members of the American Kennel Club (AKC) herding group in 1993, and both Standard and Miniature Poodles joined the AKC’s non-sporting group in 1887.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Aussiedoodle is a relatively recent mixed breed—likely originating around the 1990s—and isn’t yet a member of the AKC.\u003C/p\u003E",
