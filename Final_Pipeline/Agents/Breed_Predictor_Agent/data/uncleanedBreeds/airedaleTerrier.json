And thanks to this, they excel in whatever they put their mind to.\r\n\r\nMost Airedales love family life and accept children when properly introduced and socialized. They tend to be good around dogs they know but are sometimes wary around dogs they don’t know. And with the Airedale Terrier breed’s innate hunting instincts, having a cat in the household can be tricky.\r\n\r\n“But wait!” adds the Airedale, “Tell them how talented I am!” Airedales have an impressive work resume as police dogs. It’s been said they can do anything, and that includes agility, dock diving, hunting, flyball, tracking, scent work, search and rescue, obedience and therapy work. (Whew!)",

Some pups may tend to be selective about meals, but on the whole, Airedales are happy, healthy dogs with lots of enthusiasm for life.",
        "grooming": "The Airedale’s short, dense, wiry coat doesn’t take long to groom. These pups don’t shed much, so a simple weekly brushing with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E will take care of those dead hairs and keep the coat healthy.\n\nGet your pup dog-show-ready with a grooming method called “hand stripping,” which leaves their coat a richer color and removes the old loose coat. This only needs to be done (by you or a groomer) three or four times a year. Hand stripping is when you pull out the dead hair by hand or with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-blades_c355_f70v83783\"\u003Estripping tool\u003C/a\u003E. Bathe your pup while you hand-strip them. If you keep up with brushing, they don’t need many baths—unless they get into something stinky.\n\nAim to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrush your Airedale’s teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily.

Start your puppy off young with a toothpaste flavor they enjoy to get them used to the dental care process, and be sure to schedule an annual cleaning by your vet.\n\nYour pup’s \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enails will need a trim\u003C/a\u003E about every four weeks, or when you start seeing (or hearing!) their nails touch the floor.",
        "training": "Airedales are incredibly versatile but need consistent training to reach their full potential—they can be quite a handful without it. They're independent pups who may think they're the boss! You need to be a confident, calm and patient leader to bring out the best in an Airedale, so they often do best if you have previous dog experience.\n\nProper training begins early when your Airedale is still a puppy. Start with the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Ebasic obedience training\u003C/a\u003E, teaching commands like sit, stay and come, and how to walk nicely on a leash. But don't stop there! Airedale terriers are intelligent, versatile and capable dogs, excelling at, among other things, sports, including agility, obedience and tracking. Play to their natural smarts and teach them more complicated tricks, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-commands-shake-a-paw\"\u003Eshaking paws\u003C/a\u003E, closing the curtains or putting away toys. Like with other dogs, positive reinforcement training is key—treats, praise and special playtime will help make training fun for both of you.\n\nRemember to include \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E. Safely introduce your pup to new people and new situations to help them be OK with meeting new people, dogs and places as they grow up. Puppy preschool is a great place to practice socialization. Here, pups learn to play nicely with each other and mix and mingle with other adults.\n\nIf you're training an adult Airedale that you've adopted, go slowly and keep things relaxed. Sometimes, your dog's previous owner didn't train them, and they may be \"set in their ways.\" It may take you more time to convince them your way is better. If you're introducing an adult dog to other adult dogs, try a relaxed, no-pressure walk in the park as a first introduction to a new acquaintance rather than a busy family BBQ with kids and dogs free-ranging with food and toys in the mix.\n\nIf you need more clarification on any aspect of training, consider getting help from a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/find-a-dog-trainer\"\u003Ecertified dog trainer\u003C/a\u003E to help you and your pet achieve your goals.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Airedale Terriers typically do well on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/your-complete-guide-to-the-best-high-quality-dog-food\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\n\nEven though these pups are very active, they can still add extra pounds if they eat more than they exercise. And with all the training you'll be doing with your pup, it's possible to reward them too much! Instead of always using treats, mix in a massage or game of fetch as your pup's reward. And check with your vet; they can help you put together a mealtime and exercise plan to help shed the extra weight and maintain your pup's nutritional needs.\n\nSide note: Some Airedales may be picky eaters, so you may need to search for food they truly enjoy. Certain Airedale Terriers may benefit from a food formula designed for dogs with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/sensitive-digestion-dry-dog-food_c294_f3v63922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esensitive stomach\u003C/a\u003E. But always consult with your veterinarian when developing your dog's diet, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their needs.",
        "exercise": "When you think of a “terrier,\" a high-energy dog is probably part of the image. And that's true for Airedale Terriers. Generally, these pups need a fair amount of exercise, about one or two hours every day. You can satisfy their energy level by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Eplaying fetch\u003C/a\u003E, jogging or taking brisk walks. Families who already enjoy being active are a great match for an Airedale. While access to a fenced yard will help your dog fulfill their exercise needs (they'll love to speed around the yard!), it's possible to have an Airedale Terrier without a fenced yard—you just have to be willing to put in extra effort with long walks and jogs (on a leash, of course).\n\nIf you don't have an at-home Airedale play paradise (i.e., a backyard), look to local dog parks as a place to exercise your pet. Just remember that Airedales pick their doggie friends carefully and may not enjoy dog parks. So be warned: If you don't have your own yard and dog parks are out, your Airedale won't have an outlet for running off-leash, so you (or your family) must devote a lot of time to exercising your dog.",
        "ideal_environment": "Airedale Terriers can be a good choice for families. Many of them love to play—sometimes enjoying rough-and-tumble games—so adding an Airedale to the mix with your kids can be an excellent combination when your pup's properly socialized and playtime is supervised. Airedales are devoted to their family and are often content to hang out with those they love best, but they can get along well with guests and other dogs provided they are appropriately socialized and you make introductions slowly.\r\n\r\nAiredales are high energy dogs, and would do best in homes with large, fenced-in yards. That's not to say they couldn't do well in small homes or apartments without a fenced-in yard. As long as their relatively high exercise needs are met through other means (like long walks, jogs and other outdoor adventures), they'll thrive.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of exercise, Airedales are an excellent choice for active pet parents and families—people who love getting outdoors, going places and having fun. And they're a solid choice for more experienced pet parents who understand dog training and how to lead their pet.",
        "h2_breed_health": "In many cases, your Airedale Terrier will be a happy, healthy dog! You can expect their lifespan to be about 11 to 14 years.

Hip dysplasia is hereditary, so it can run in family lines. However, environmental factors such as exercise, growth rate, hormones, and diet also influence this genetic disease. While genetic screening is not readily available, responsible breeders shouldn't continue to breed lines known to have hip dysplasia. If you have concerns about your pup's hips, examination with your veterinarian and likely specialized x-rays are the best way to diagnose hip dysplasia and determine the best treatment plan. Options include weight management, joint supplements, physical therapy and surgery, depending on the case's severity.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/endocrine/c_dg_hypothyroidism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHypothyroidism\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: Some larger dogs, including the Airedale Terrier, are susceptible to issues with their thyroid glands.

Bloat can be genetic and run in certain lines, but environmental factors such as exercising immediately after eating, ingesting large amounts of water and food too quickly, or conformationally having a very deep chest can all contribute. Common signs of bloat include dry heaving, non-productive retching, distended abdomen, and collapse. GDV is a life-threatening medical emergency, so if you have any concerns about your dog experiencing bloat, see the vet or emergency vet immediately.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeart Disease\u003C/strong\u003E: Airedales can have several different types of heart disease, so if your veterinarian detects a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cardiovascular/c_dg_heart_murmur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eheart murmur\u003C/a\u003E, they will likely also recommend a consultation with a veterinary cardiologist for further evaluation, including an echocardiogram (echo) to determine what is going on. One of the most common types of heart disease in Airedales includes dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which occurs when the heart becomes enlarged, causing the heart muscles to weaken due to thinning as they stretch out. Your vet can treat DCM with medications.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
        "h2_breed_history": "The origin of the Airedale Terrier began in the 1800s in northern England when factory and mill workers of the Aire Valley decided to develop a brave and versatile hunting dog to chase down ducks and rats. The \"King of Terriers\" was developed using several terrier breeds and the Otterhound breed. Over time, breeders may have introduced additional breeds to establish further the desired characteristics you see in Airedale today. The Airedale Terrier was sometimes called the Bingley Terrier in the early days.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Airedale by 1888, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://airedale.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAiredale Terrier Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was established in 1900. Airedale Terriers have been popular with a few United States presidents, including Calvin Coolidge. Airedales have been beloved hunting dogs throughout their history but have also excelled as police and military dogs, serving in World War I. Today, the Airedale Terrier ranks No. 62 on the AKC's list of most popular dog breeds.\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find an Airedale Terrier puppy?
