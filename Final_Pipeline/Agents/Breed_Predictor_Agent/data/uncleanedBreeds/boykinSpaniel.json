Some might want to mouth you a little on the arm; but don't worry, they don't grip down—it's just their way of playing.\r\n\r\nBecause Boykin Spaniels were bred to be hunting dogs, their high energy level serves them well in jobs of that type.

That said, new puppies need a lot of supervision, so raising a Boykin Spaniel will definitely keep you on your toes. They can be very energetic, so don't be surprised to find they've chewed your new shoes when your back was turned. (If they suddenly become suspiciously quiet, that's a sign they might be getting into trouble.)\n\nBoykins are sensitive, so training that uses positive reinforcement (treats and praise as rewards for positive behavior) and is consistent and even-handed is the best way for them to learn. When working with Boykin puppies, it's important to make sure that both their minds and bodies are stimulated so they don't get distracted by things like, well, your new shoes. Get your Boykin something to chew on that's digestible, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/best-bully-sticks-6-joint-jerky-dog/dp/135391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBest Bully Sticks\u003C/a\u003E or other \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etraining treats\u003C/a\u003E.

Puppy school is a good place to start. It teaches your pup how to play nicely with other puppies—and their pet parents, too.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Boykin Spaniel typically does well on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nYour vet can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet. Allergies to foods like wheat can crop up in them, too, so check with your vet if you have questions about food sensitivities.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to specific nutritional needs, due to their active lifestyles, Boykin Spaniels may benefit from \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/high-protein-11105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-protein dog food\u003C/a\u003E.

Always check with your vet before you share any people food with your pooch, too.\r\n\r\nTreats can help with training, but keep calories in mind, too. Obesity can lead to health issues like heart disease, so factor treat calories into their overall diet plan to keep your pup from gaining extra weight.",

They enjoy the water and would thrive in a home with a pool or a pond—just make sure they're properly taught how to get out of the pool, especially if there are no steps, and always supervise them when they're swimming.\n\nHow much daily activity is best for these high-energy pups? They'll thrive with vigorous exercise three times a day, for 10-15 minutes at a time. You should wait until they're about 9 months to a 1 old, though, before you take them running or jogging with you; strenuous activities before that time can damage their growing joints.

The larger their area is to run and play, the happier they'll be. A small home or an apartment are OK, as long as you're able to give them the exercise and outdoor activity they need.\r\n\r\nThey're a good choice for pet parents who've had previous experience with high-energy dogs and who can keep up with their exercise needs. You like exploring the great outdoors every chance you get? Perfect, so do they!

        "h2_breed_history": "Boykin Spaniels have an impressive origin and history. They were originally bred for wild turkey and duck hunting in the swampy areas of South Carolina in the early 1900s. Word got around pretty quickly about these medium hunting dogs' high levels of physical and mental stamina—as well as their relentless work ethic—and they soon became so beloved in their home state that they've earned the title of the official state dog of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAlthough the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Boykin Spaniel in 2009, their popularity has skyrocketed in the decade or so since thanks to their highly desirable characteristics and personality. Although they can be very focused on work, especially hunting, their friendly and happy-go-lucky nature has blossomed to the benefit of families who enjoy being active with these high-energy pets.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find Boykin Spaniel puppies today? The \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/boykin-spaniel?breed=54&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E offers a list of reputable breeders and contact information for them. What's the average Boykin Spaniel price? Expect to pay about $1,000 for a pup, although some are as much as $4,500 if you're looking for a high-quality performance or show dog. For that price, you're usually getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Boykin Spaniel rescue organizations to adopt a Boykin or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
