But the pups were bred as hunting dogs, so they may think they're smarter than you and know better. Starting while your English Setter's a puppy and being patient will win them over.

These experiences will help their naturally friendly nature shine. Take them on walks and introduce them to new people and dogs and enroll in puppy preschool.

        "diet_nutrition": "\u003Cp\u003ELike most dogs, high-quality commercially available dog food should suffice for your English Setter.

        "exercise": "\u003Cp\u003EEnglish Setters have a high energy level, and they require daily exercise. Plan on spending about an hour every day dedicated to burning their energy reserves. While pet parents who have an active lifestyle will find they have a great buddy for running and hiking, it's not a deal-breaker for pet parents who aren't so active. Like many dogs, a long walk twice a day with your furry companion should be more than enough. Playing games like fetch in the backyard or at the dog park are also great ways to give them the activity they need. If you're a bit competitive, you and your pup may enjoy dog sports, like agility or tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThese dogs are born to hunt, so any off-leash activity needs to be in a controlled environment, like a fenced yard or dog park. Otherwise, your nose-first pup may catch wind of something that needs chasing, and they're off speeding away from you! Even with all the expert training you'll give, these pups will be laser-focused on their quarry. And no amount of calling or begging will get them to pay attention to you. So, for their safety and your mental health, always have them on a leash when out and about.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's important to note that the English Setter breed doesn't fully mature until they're about 2 years old. Protect their growing bones and joints and don't include them in strenuous activities until after they've stopped growing. It's a good idea to check with your vet before engaging in a new activity.\u003C/p\u003E",

These guys are great with kids and other dogs, and with proper socialization, they'll even get along with cats. But English Setters will chase small pets that look like critters—hamsters, rabbits and gerbils beware. And they're relatively easy to train, making them a good choice for someone looking for their first pet.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThese dogs really need a home with a fenced yard where they can run around and get all their wiggles out.

Purcell Llewellin.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt one point, English Setters were referred to as Laverack or Llewellin Setters, a name clearly reflecting their lineage.
