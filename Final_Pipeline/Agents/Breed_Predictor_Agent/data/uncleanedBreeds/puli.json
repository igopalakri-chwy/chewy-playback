The downside to having the long corded fur is that when it covers their eyes and disguises the tail and ears of the Puli, it can be difficult for other dogs to read their body language—the primary way dogs communicate.

The breed herded flocks of sheep on the Hungarian plains, developing its trademark corded coat to help protect them from frigid winters.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EStarting in the 17th century, the number of Pulik dwindled and almost disappeared, but Dr. Emil Raitsits, professor at the Hungarian University of Veterinarian Medicine, revived the breeding of Pulik and established the breed standard between 1912-1915 so they didn't become a lost part of canine history.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EThe Puli was brought to the United States in 1935 as part of a study by the US Department of Agriculture to find a breed that wouldn't harm the animals they were supposed to be herding. They mixed Pulik with other breeds and kept some purebred, but the program yielded nothing definitive. After World War II, the Pulik were auctioned off to breeders, becoming the pets we know today.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EThe American Kennel Club recognized the Puli in 1936.
