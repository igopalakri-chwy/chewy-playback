        "h2_breed_temperament": "There is a whole lot of personality packed into the compact Cairn Terrier. They are a friendly, sociable breed who loves making new friends wherever they go, of both the two- and four-legged variety. So, yes, you can expect to leave any trip to the dog park with a puppy playdate booked for next week. Hope you like a full social calendar! Cairns are good with kids, and their scrappy personalities allow them to enjoy the rough-and-tumble play of an afternoon outside with the little kiddos (as long as they follow the no ear or tail pulling rule).\r\n\r\nCairns were originally bred to hunt vermin out of rock piles, or “cairns\" in Scotland, so they are a working terrier breed. Rock piles are scarce nowadays outside of Scotland, but Cairns' high prey drive will keep them on alert for squirrels, bunnies or any other small furry animals that dare to invade their territory. Their instinct to dig is strong, so some savvy pet parents have been known to provide their Cairn Terrier with a sand box of hidden toys to dig for—this keeps their dog happy and their daisies intact. Win, win.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, their temperament is happy-go-lucky, and they're never more content than when sharing an adventure with you. Energetic and curious, they're always up for a game of fetch, a tussle with their favorite tug toy, or just a walk around the neighborhood. But beware the bored Cairn pup who will quickly turn into a barking Cairn pup—one who may not stop until the entertainment resumes, which just might make you your neighbor's least favorite person. And while they are not known to be lapdogs glad to just watch the world go by, Cairn Terriers may well snuggle up at the end of a busy day for a chance to recharge before tomorrow's adventure begins.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Cairn Terrier dogs need an average amount of tending to, including regular grooming, exercise and consistent training. Fortunately, these bright little dogs are a quick study, leaving you with lots of time to play when the work is done.",
        "grooming": "Compared to, say, an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/old-english-sheepdog/\"\u003EOld English Sheepdog\u003C/a\u003E, keeping a Cairn Terrier's appearance in tip-top shape requires minimal grooming. Since they are a double-coated breed who sheds minimally, they only need a weekly brushing with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea soft pin brush\u003C/a\u003E to keep their wiry fur in good condition. They have a weather-resistant coat and should only be bathed about every three months—too-frequent bathing can strip the oil from their coats. Hand stripping their coat every four to six months, either yourself or by a professional groomer, is also key to keep their haircuts from getting too straggly. (Hand stripping is when you pluck the dead hair by hand instead of using shears; this promotes new growth.)\n\nGood dental hygiene is especially important for Cairns, as small breed dogs tend to build up tartar more easily because their mouths are smaller and their teeth get crowded. So, it's important to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebrush your pup's teeth\u003C/a\u003E every day, and be sure to get them professionally cleaned once a year by your vet. Start brushing your dog's teeth while they're young, so they'll be used to it as they get older. A good quality \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/dental-chews-1463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edental chew\u003C/a\u003E can also be helpful in keeping their pearly whites, well, white.\n\nLet's not forget those nails! They'll \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Eneed to be trimmed\u003C/a\u003E about every four to eight weeks. If you can hear their nails clicking on the floor, it's time for that home pedicure you promised. Or you can leave it to your groomer. You know which will be more fun.",
        "training": "Cairn Terriers have a strong-willed streak, so consistent training is crucial. (No days off for you!) They were bred to be solitary hunters, so these independent types are not used to looking to anyone for direction and prefer to make their own decisions. Their instinct to chase squirrels, rabbits, other dogs, and basically anything else, is one of their traits you'll find nearly impossible to train away. But don't blame them; they come by it honestly (see above, re: hunting). So, never let your pup off-leash unless you're in a fenced yard.\n\nFortunately, they are smart and quick to learn. With positive reinforcement training—treats, toys, and lots of praise for a job well done—even a 10-week-old puppy can begin to learn \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Ebasic commands\u003C/a\u003E. As they get older, they will do best with several short training sessions of five to 10 minutes each day, as opposed to one long session. The most important thing is to be consistent and make sure they know you're, in fact, the top dog. Otherwise, your adorable Cairn Terrier could become a rather less enticing Cairn “Terror.\"",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Cairn Terrier breed needs a complete and balanced diet for optimal health, and typically does best on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure the food you choose meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and that you factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior dog). Consult with your vet on the feeding chart best for your dog. They can guide you on how much and how often to feed your Cairn based on their specific diet needs.\r\n\r\nAnd what about treats? Since Cairn Terriers are prone to obesity, it's probably best to go easy on the treats. But again, your veterinarian will know best and can help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Cairns thrive on activity, and while their exercise needs may not include a five-mile walk every day, they do need to run. They do best with short bursts of full-out speediness several times a day. So while, yes, you may have hated running suicides in high school gym class, these little balls of energy can't think of anything better. Take them out in the yard and play fetch with them for 20 to 30 minutes every day. Or have them play with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/rope-tug-toys-321\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Echase and tug toy\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nLooking for a way to burn off physical\u003Ci\u003E and\u003C/i\u003E mental energy? Their intelligence and high energy level makes them a natural for dog sports such as agility, herding, Earthdog events (where a pup hunts underground) and lure coursing (where the dog chases a mechanical lure around a track).",
        "ideal_environment": "Cairns are adaptable little terriers who can thrive in any setting from a tiny city apartment to a country estate, as long as they get enough exercise. As long as they're properly socialized and trained, they are a great dog for an active family. Just remember, they do expect to be included in all the family activities. For these sensitive pups, FOMO is real. They enjoy having other dogs in the family to play with (although they can be bossy), and can get along with cats as long as they are introduced at a young age. Because they are such a flexible breed, Cairns would be a good fit for first-time pet parents.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Cairn Terriers’ lifespan tends to be long, about 13 to 15 years or more, and they are generally a healthy, hardy breed. But they have a few health problems you should be aware of, so you can help your pup live the longest life possible.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_multi_patellar_luxation\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELuxating Patella\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: This is a condition in which the kneecap moves out of its normal position when the knee joint flexes and extends.

        "h2_breed_history": "The origin of the Cairn Terrier lies in Scotland and the breed dates to the 17th century. They lived predominantly in the Western Highlands, in particular on the Isle of Skye, where they patrolled game preserves and farms.\r\n\r\nFor many years, they were lumped together with other terriers and collectively called \"Scotch Terriers.\" It wasn't until the late 1800s that they were recognized as their own distinct breed. In those days, large mounds of rocks, or \"cairns,\" were used to mark a boundary or grave. Rodents and other vermin would take up residence inside and underneath the cairns and it was the Cairn Terrier's job to dig and evict the critters. This was usually a one-dog job, but sometimes multiple dogs would work together as a pack and go after bigger critters such as foxes and otters.\r\n\r\nThe Cairn's bravery, tenacity and independence were qualities that served them well when they were working the windswept Highlands of Scotland. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Cairn Terrier in 1913 as the 69th breed. In 1939, the whole world met the adorable breed when a Cairn Terrier was picked to play Toto in a little movie called \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\r\n\r\nYou can find a Cairn Terrier puppy to adopt today by checking out a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/cairn-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E.
