        "h2_breed_temperament": "This high-energy, intelligent dog loves to get out and adventure with an active family. As a friendly and regal pup, Beaucerons can adapt well to children if they're \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialized\u003C/a\u003E from the time they're a puppy. To be extra safe with kids, you'll want to set up playpens and baby gates and close doors when needed, since the dogs can be pretty strong. Plus, they're herders, so they may try to herd smaller children. And of course, monitor their interactions when they're together, to ensure everyone—dogs and tiny, young humans alike—respect each others' boundaries.\n\nAlthough they look intimidating, Beaucerons are not aggressive. When they do run up to people, it's to greet them enthusiastically. However, Beaucerons can be trained to be effective guard dogs when needed.\n\nTheir high level of intelligence makes them easy to train, but those smarts can also lead them to feel stressed or anxious if they don't get enough mental stimulation\u003Cb\u003E—\u003C/b\u003Eand it also can mean they can be comedians and get into a lot of funny antics.\n\nBeaucerons have a strong prey drive, so they may not be the best pet for homes with cats or small dogs. But early socialization can certainly help with other dogs and cats in the home. But even around other dogs, you'll want to supervise them, since they can be a little bossy when they play.\n\nBecause of their intelligence, large size and high energy levels, they may not be the best choice for first-time pet parents. But experienced pet parents who have previous experience training dogs may find a Beauceron to be a loyal companion for life.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "The Beauceron breed doesn't need a lot of grooming, but they do need a lot of exercise. So while brushing and bathing won't take up a lot of your time, you will need to take them out for adventures at least a couple of times every day. Beaucerons also do best with early socialization so they can adapt well to encounters with other pets and strangers.",
        "grooming": "Good news! You can save the epic adventures for your vacation, rather than grooming your Beauceron. While you don't need to brush your Beauceron every day, you'll want to brush your them a few times a week with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E to keep up with the shedding. And when the seasons change in the spring, they'll shed more, which may temporarily up your brushing game to daily.\n\nWhen it comes to baths, Beaucerons only need a dip in the bubbles about once a month, unless they get dirty while playing outside and need an extra bath. When you do bathe your Beauceron, use a good quality \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/shampoos-2445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog shampoo\u003C/a\u003E with natural ingredients and make sure they are rinsed thoroughly and dried well.\n\nLet's talk teeth. In general, many veterinarians recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrushing your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily. You'll have the most success if you start brushing your dog's teeth as a puppy, so they get used to the sensation. Your veterinarian can help teach you the best tooth brushing techniques. You'll also want to visit your vet annually for professional teeth cleaning.\n\nBeaucerons may need their nails trimmed every six to eight weeks. Some, however, will naturally file down their nails through play and exercise outside. You can tell your dog \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Eneeds a nail trimming\u003C/a\u003E when you can hear the clickety-clack of their claws on the floor before you can actually see your pup.",
        "training": "When you make a Beauceron puppy your family member, make sure they know who rules the roost (you, of course), as they can test boundaries that aren't clearly defined. Without guidance, you may find your Beauceron trying to become the supreme ruler of the household.\n\nThankfully, these intelligent dogs respond well to encouragement and positive reinforcement training, and they're eager to please. Treats might not motivate them, but they'll be very motivated by their favorite toy. As dogs with high prey drives, Beaucerons will respond well to training that hones in on their desire to herd, like using \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/outward-hound-tail-teaser-refill-dog/dp/50955\"\u003Eflirt poles\u003C/a\u003E (exercise equipment for dogs that entices them to chase a fast-moving lure) or Treibball (a sport where you direct your dog to move large exercise balls into a goal, like herding sheep into a pen).\n\nA good rule is to start training and socializing your Beauceron as a puppy. Some pet parents prefer the help of certified trainers, so they'll begin by taking their Beaucerons to puppy classes and then graduate to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience training\u003C/a\u003E, where they learn commands like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E. Whether training yourself or with a professional, you'll want to make sure your dog is socialized to get along with other dogs and people. Ultimately, Beaucerons are so smart, they can be trained for some pretty impressive jobs, including being a guard dog, a hunting dog or even working with police or helping with search and rescue operations.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Beaucerons tend do well on high-quality, commercial dog food that provides a balanced diet meeting all their nutrition needs. You'll want to provide food designed for their current stage in life, whether they're a puppy, an adult dog or a senior dog. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart that will guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nBe sure and calculate any treats you may give your dog during the day, so you don't accidentally overfeed your dog. And of course, if your dog is getting a lot of exercise every day, you'll want to keep this in mind too and feed a little more accordingly. Since Beaucerons love mental challenges, they might also enjoy slow feeders and interactive toys (such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/kong-dog-toys_c315_f1v151771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EKongs\u003C/a\u003E) that dispense their food through play.\r\n\r\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian. They are in the best position to help you pick the ideal food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "In order to give your Beauceron the exercise they need every day, you'll need to exercise both their minds and their bodies, totalling about two hours.\r\n\r\nTake your pup on a long walk, about an hour, and give them time to explore with their noses. Beaucerons love to run and play outdoors, so jogging and hiking can be fun activities for the both of you.\r\n\r\nThis breed also loves to guard and hunt. Since they have such a strong herding instinct, competitive sports may be a great option for Beaucerons. Consider dog sports like Treibball, where a dog pushes a large ball toward a goal. Parkour, which is an agility sport that involves running, jumping, balancing and climbing over various obstacles, is also something they'd love. Beaucerons can also take to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/aboutflyball.shtml\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E sports.\r\n\r\nAnother fun exercise your Beauceron will love is Canicross, which is a form of urban mushing where instead of pulling sleds, your dog pulls you. Mental and physical work out while spending time with their favorite person? Well that's a recipe for a very happy Beauceron.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is this: Don't skimp out on a Beauceron's exercise. If they don't get enough mental and physical stimulation, they might take out some of their pent-up energy on your favorite shoes or furniture.",
        "ideal_environment": "A Beauceron's ideal environment is one where they can spend a lot of time with their pet parents, going on adventures and outings, and in general where they can be a part of the action. Their high exercise needs make a larger home with a yard where they can run and play and get rid of pent-up energy preferable, but Beaucerons can adapt well to a smaller apartment, as long as they're taken on at least two long, brisk walks—about an hour each—every day.\r\n\r\nThe Beauceron breed can get along well with children and other pets if they've been socialized well as puppies, even though you'll still want to keep a close eye on them. Their herding instincts run deep, and they may try to herd smaller kids and other dogs. However, they might not do well in homes with cats since they have a strong prey drive.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Beaucerons have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years and are considered a healthy breed.

This condition is life-threatening, so you’ll want to see a veterinarian immediately if your pet develops symptoms suspicious of bloat. Symptoms include salivating, trying to throw up without success (dry heaving or retching), pacing, breathing rapidly or acting distressed.

However, genetics likely play a factor and if other dogs in the family line have bloated, your pup may be at increased risk. The treatment is emergency surgery but a preventative version of this surgery to tack the stomach to the body well can sometimes help prevent bloat from occurring and is often performed at a young dog’s spay or neuter.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Beauceron's origin dates back to France in the Middle Ages. In fact, the oldest manuscript referencing the Beauceron is a Renaissance manuscript from 1578 by French naturalist M.Buffon.\r\n\r\nOne of two French sheepdogs, the Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce or the Bas Rouge. In 1896, the two breeds of French shepherd dogs were officially classified. The French shepherd dog with shorter hair was named the Beauceron and the dog with long coat was named the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/briard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBriard\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nThroughout their history, the Beauceron has had many roles. They were used in World War I in trench warfare, as messenger dogs for the French army, and to herd and guard livestock including sheep and cattle. They've even served as police dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Beauceron was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2007 and assigned to the Herding group. (Herding breeds share an instinctual ability to control the movement of other animals.) The dog is more well known in France, while in the United States, the breed is sometimes mistaken for Doberman Pinschers.\r\n\r\nSo where is the best place to find Beauceron puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Beauceron breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/beauceron?breed=30&amp;page=1\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E.
