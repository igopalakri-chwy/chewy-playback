        "h2_breed_temperament": "You can think of Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs, with their large size and endearingly social personalities, as big, friendly giants. They generally love meeting new people and have outgoing personalities. That social tendency also means they don't enjoy being left alone without their families for long and are very fond of snuggling.\r\n\r\nOne well-loved trait of this breed is their ability to bond strongly with their families. They particularly enjoy spending time with children, although parents need to be vigilant as Swissies can be very enthusiastic and forget their size when playing—possibly toppling younger children in the process! Proper training and socialization will help them learn self-control and manners around smaller or more fragile members of your family. It also greatly helps to teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs can get along well with cats as long as they're properly introduced. These dogs have an impressive herding drive and a complimentary prey drive, so teaching puppies how to properly interact with other pets is on the list of life lessons for your new friend.\r\n\r\nThey can have a slight stubborn streak (like most of us, let's be honest), which means they need patient and calm parents to balance them out. You'll need to be confident in your abilities in guiding the pup to channel the dog's powerful playfulness in the right direction using positive training techniques. Translation: Reward their good behavior with praise, toys and of course, treats. (It's really all about the treats.)\r\n\r\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs are watchdogs but not guard dogs. They may sound the alarm with plenty of deep, throaty barking when a stranger approaches your home, but most strangers will be greeted with friendliness once they cross the threshold. These pups enjoy keeping an eye on the neighborhood and will tell you about anything out of the ordinary with a bark or two.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Good news: Taking care of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog doesn't have to be a full-time job. Their coats are low-maintenance (though they do shed a bit), so you won't be spending lots of time or money on grooming. Instead, plan to work in dedicated sessions each day for socializing, exercising and training these high-energy pups.",

The Swiss Mountain Dog sheds heavily twice a year, in the spring and fall, in a process known as blowing their coat. A dog who blows their coat will shed it in chunks of fur instead of shedding individual hairs.

        "training": "Diligent and dedicated training brings out the best of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog's brains and brawn. As a large breed, Swissies take time to mature mentally and physically, and they're independent and intelligent, too. They need a calm and confident leader who understands these pups need patience and consistency in training them. First-time pup parents can be frustrated with the challenges of training this breed, making Swissies a better choice for someone with previous dog experience.\n\nWhen it comes to training your Swissy, plenty of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E should be the priority with quality over quantity when it comes to interactions with people, other dogs and new environments. To help get them used to meeting new people and other dogs, start while they're a puppy and take them on walks to meet and sniff the people and other dogs they encounter. And enroll in puppy preschool, where they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003EObedience training\u003C/a\u003E is important for all Swissies, whether they're puppies or fully grown.

Be sure to use rewards like treats, praise and playtime to encourage your pup when they do a good job.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog breed typically thrives on a complete and balanced \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E.

Look at the packaging for a statement that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things to consider when raising a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is the fact that, like many large dog breeds, they're slow to mature, and that's OK. It's essential to avoid rapid weight gain, which can cause orthopedic disorders as your puppy grows up. The easiest way to achieve this is to provide the correct nutrition and not overfeed them, as this can lead to preventable health issues, including obesity and joint problems.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to include the treats you give in your daily meal plan. Those calories count, too! If you see your dog gaining extra weight, speak with your vet. They can help you develop a customized nutrition plan based on your dog's needs to shed the weight and still maintain their optimal nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have plenty of energy and will enjoy 30 minutes of walking a day. They love the great outdoors, so include them on hikes or long walks in nature. They're not, however, suited for jogging.\n\nThis working breed was originally used by farmers, herdsmen and merchants and was bred for a variety of tasks, including guarding and drafting (pulling carts). Swissies are able to pull up to 3,000 pounds! They can perform well in a variety of dog sports, including drafting, weight pulling, herding, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, dock diving, conformity (dog shows) and more. They're game for trying anything, as long as it means more time with you. Before you do try a new activity, check in with your vet to make sure your pup is physically healthy and up to the task.\n\nSwissies aren't very well-adapted to hot conditions, so take care not to overwork your dog in hot weather and keep your exercises to the cooler parts of the day.\n\nA note about puppies: Large-breed dogs like the Swissy take longer to grow up, and care needs to be taken to support their growing joints and growth plates. Keep puppy exercise more low-key (like walks) and avoid more strenuous activity (like dog sports) until they're fully grown, around 2 years old.",
        "ideal_environment": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs love nothing more than being part of your world, whether that's just you or a family. They crave attention, physical contact and lots of activity. Swissies won't enjoy being left home alone or out in the backyard without company.\r\n\r\nWith plenty of socialization and training, Swissies can live alongside other pets, including cats, very happily. They can have a high prey drive, so all your leash training will come in handy when a squirrel or bunny runs across the street on evening walks.\r\n\r\nThis breed absolutely needs a family that can provide the physical and mental activity they need to thrive. Give your Swissy a job, like a dog sport or pulling kids in a cart, and they will make sure it gets done! They love to watch over their pet parents but will also enthusiastically participate in anything else you ask of them. Swissies are independent and need a confident, consistent leader to guide them, making the dog a better choice for an experienced pup parent.\r\n\r\nSome Swissies don't cope with heat very well—which isn't too surprising when you consider their Alpine origins. If you live where it gets warm, keep your outdoor activity to the cooler parts of the day and keep the AC going when inside.\r\n\r\nOne of the classic Greater Swiss Mountain Dog traits is keeping a keen eye on their surroundings and barking whenever something seems outs of place. However, they tend to be both confident and kind around strangers, so they don't make great guard dogs.\r\n\r\nBecause these dogs are large and very active, they need a home and yard with lots of room to move around and run. This makes them an unsuitable choice for people living in small spaces, like apartments and condos.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The exact origin of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is unclear, but they're believed to be descendants of the war dogs used by Roman Legions during their invasion of the Alps. Swissies belong to a group of dogs known as \"Sennenhunds,\" and in their native Switzerland are known as Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund or Grand Bouvier Suisse. The other breeds within the Sennenhund group include the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBernese Mountain Dog\u003C/a\u003E, the Appenzeller, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/entlebucher-mountain-dog/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEntlebucher Mountain Dog\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nUp to the early 1800s, the Swissy was used by Alpine dairy farmers who found it cheaper to train dogs to pull carts instead of horses. This breed worked hard as draft dogs and hauled carts filled with dairy and meat to local markets. Swissies were also used as a general farm dog, watched over cattle and were good-natured and loyal family companions.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1800s, automation and mechanization meant the breed wasn't needed for work, and their population decreased dramatically. In an attempt to preserve the breed, the Swiss Kennel Club recognized the dog in 1910. The first dogs were brought to the US in 1968, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog in 1995, and they're a member of the Working group (the dogs bred with a job to do).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the best place to find Swissy puppies, the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/greater-swiss-mountain-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC keeps a list of reputable breeders\u003C/a\u003E, as does the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.gsmdca.org/find-a-gsmd/breeders-classifieds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGreater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America.\u003C/a\u003E A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog puppy costs 1,500-$3,000.
