        "h2_breed_temperament": "The Norwich Terrier temperament is approachable and affectionate. These characteristics make them great family dogs. Not only do these pups love their people and do well in homes with kids, but they'll likely fare better than other terrier breeds in multi-pet homes as well because they're typically tolerant of cats and other dogs.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers know how to enjoy life, and they're happiest when they are around their humans, so you can be sure that wherever you go, you'll have the cutest of all little companions by your side. These dogs are active and intelligent, so they're not super fond of being left alone for long. They prefer to be where the action is—FOMO is real—and whether it's physical activity or mental stimulation, they must be kept busy.\r\n\r\nThese guys are always on high alert, and they'll bark if anything suspicious comes near them or their family. But while they make great watchdogs (that big-dog-stuck-in-a-small-dog mentality really comes in handy here), pet parents should make every attempt to keep their Norwich Terrier's barking in check from an early age. If not, it may become a nuisance as the pup grows into adulthood.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers seem to have a wanderlust gene and they are quite inquisitive as well. While these traits might be fine on their own, they can spell trouble when paired with the Norwich Terrier's high prey drive. For these reasons, it's crucial to host any off-leash playtime in fenced-in areas, to prevent them chasing critters and ending up lost or in danger. When you're not in an enclosed space, they should be on a leash at all times.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers are happy-go-lucky and eager-to-please, and pet parents will find that they are easy to train with positive reinforcement (treats, toys and praise for a job well done). It's important to remember, though, that they're fearless warriors and they'll rise to any challenge. These traits can also lead them to be strong-willed and even a bit bossy. In light of that, calm and confident pet parents can win them over with consistency and patience.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Taking good care of Norwich Terriers is not an especially complicated task. They should be brushed at least once a week, and like most dogs, paying attention to their dental health with regular toothbrushing is important. These guys have plenty of energy, so some form of daily exercise is important as well. While they're generally friendly and affectionate, their tough nature can lead them to be a bit bossy. To keep some of those undesirable traits in check, training and socialization are crucial for your Norwich Terrier.",
        "grooming": "Norwich Terriers have a distinctive double coat; the topcoat is hard, wiry and straight, and their undercoat is soft. When it comes to grooming a Norwich Terrier, there are two schools of thought: clipping or hand stripping.\n\n\"Team hand stripping\" often argues that this process (pulling out each dead hair to make way for new growth) is the only way to maintain the integrity of these terriers' tough, almost weatherproof coat. Hand- stripping can be a time-consuming process, however, not to mention uncomfortable for the dog if not done properly. As a parent of a Norwich Terrier, this may be something to keep in mind. Additionally, if you don't want to do it yourself, it might be difficult to find groomers who will do it for you.\n\nOn the other hand, \"team clipping\" argues that \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/grooming-a-dog-with-clippers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eclipping the hair\u003C/a\u003E of your Norwich Terrier hair is just fine. However, pet parents should know that clipped hair may grow back softer, and your dog may lose their hard, wiry coat. Moreover, a softer coat could lead to more shedding.\n\nRegardless how you choose to groom the coat, Norwich Terriers should be brushed at least once a week, and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebaths\u003C/a\u003E should be limited to once every three months. (Too much bathing can irritate their skin.)\n\nTaking care of your dog's dental health is important as well. Ideally, you should plan to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebrush your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily. For all pet parents, a best practice would be to get their puppy used to the feel of having their teeth brushed so the process will be easier as the dog grows into adulthood. Beyond daily brushings, it's also important to have your dog's teeth professionally cleaned by your vet at least once a year.\n\nPet parents should also \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etrim the nails\u003C/a\u003E of their Norwich Terrier regularly. While most dogs will wear their nails down naturally, a little parental intervention may be necessary from time to time, about once a month. If you're not sure how often to cut your Norwich Terriers nails, just keep in mind that if you can hear them tapping on the floor, it's time for a trim.",
        "training": "Norwich Terriers are known for their intelligence and eagerness to please, so you should be able to train them with some speed. They have a strong work ethic and are happiest when they have a job to do, so positive reinforcement is key. If there are no vermin to chase, training is a great pinch hitter for a good day's work.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers are tough and fearless, so they're never afraid to take charge. That kind of grit could lead to trouble down the line if you don't establish boundaries from the get-go. For those reasons, pet parents should set the rules early and remain consistent. Establish boundaries early on, and let your Norwich Terrier know who's the real boss in a calm, patient and confident way.\r\n\r\nFor best results, pet parents should keep training sessions interesting for their pups. About 10 minutes per session should do it. It's important to celebrate successes and stop before either you or your pup get frustrated. When raising a Norwich Terrier puppy, keeping them engaged and dialing down the repetition and boredom are key.\r\n\r\nAs with any new puppy, early socialization—exposing your Norwich Terrier to lots of different people, places and stimuli—is key. Aim to introduce them to experiences in a positive way and to environments they will encounter regularly throughout life, like the vet's office, the park, honking horns, passing cars and the like. Early encounters like these are critical to helping puppies become successful and versatile pets later in life.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Norwich Terriers don't have any specific nutritional requirements nor do they require any type of special food. Generally speaking, they'll do well with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog foods\u003C/a\u003E. Just be sure that you choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nWhile most dog foods come with recommendations for portion sizes, remember that each dog is different. Your Norwich Terrier's height and weight will affect portion sizes, and their daily intake should be a direct reflection of their age, activity level and general health. Norwich pet parents also need to keep in mind that these guys are prone to obesity, so portion control is crucial. Don't forget that treats have calories too, so you'll have to watch how many you dole out every day. The hardest part will be trying to resist their cute faces when they ask for more. We sincerely wish you the best of luck.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about your Norwich Terrier's optimal nutrition, chat with your vet, who is the best person to guide you. They can help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Like most terriers, Norwich Terriers have a high energy level and therefore require daily exercise—a 15- to 20-minute walk twice a day should be plenty. The good news? These guys make wonderful workout partners whether you're walking, jogging, running or hiking. If you're not active yourself, playtime in the yard can easily satisfy your Norwich Terrier's exercise needs.\r\n\r\nIn light of their origin as hunting dogs and ratters, Norwich Terriers have a good work ethic written into their DNA. Today, in the absence of a hunt, this breed will often excel in obedience and several types of dog sports, like agility, barn hunt and earthdog (a sport in which dogs hunt for underground critters—who are safely contained, so not at risk from the dogs). These activities fit the bill for the challenge and working lifestyle they crave.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers are super smart and always need something to do. Whether it's physical activity or mental stimulation, they revel in a task to keep them busy. If a brisk walk isn't on the schedule or it's too rainy outside to play, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog puzzles\u003C/a\u003E can be pretty helpful for keeping boredom at bay.",
        "ideal_environment": "Due to their small size, Norwich Terriers tend to do just fine in apartments or small homes. Those with a fenced yard are the best option, however, as they'll give your pup plenty of room to run and play. If you're taking your Norwich Terrier out for a walk, be sure to keep them on a leash and, ideally for this breed, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/harnesses-347?nav-submit-button=&amp;ref=searchRedirect&amp;ref-query=dog%20harness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eharness\u003C/a\u003E. (Terriers are prone to tracheal collapse; using a harness rather than a collar can help to prevent this.)\n\nTheir sweet and affectionate temperament makes Norwich Terriers great family dogs, and truth be told, they are never happier than when they get to spend time with their favorite people. Pet parents should take note that while Norwich Terriers are great with kids, a home with older children may be better for these guys. The Norwich Terrier breed seems to be less tolerant of the antics of toddlers, and without the proper training and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E, your pup may mistake the exuberance of a tiny tot as a threat. So, be sure to supervise playtimes with your dog and small kids.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Norwich Terriers have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. While they are sturdy sporting dogs and generally healthy, they are not without some health concerns. As a potential pet parent, it’s important to know what types of Norwich Terrier health issues you may see and how you can treat them.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/collapsing-trachea-dogs-everything-you-need-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETracheal Collapse\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: Often seen in small breeds, tracheal collapse is a common health issue in Norwich Terriers. This condition is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings, which eventually flatten out and obstruct their airway. Some common symptoms of tracheal collapse include coughing that sounds like a honk, trouble breathing, fainting and fatigue. Initially, tracheal collapse is typically treated medically but if it progresses or is severe, surgery may be needed. Pet parents of smaller breeds like the Norwich Terrier should be advised to walk their dog with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/small-dog-harnesses_c347_f6v13790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eharness\u003C/a\u003E rather than a collar to help decrease pressure on the trachea.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElongated Soft Palates\u003C/strong\u003E: An elongated soft palate is another condition often seen in the Norwich Terrier breed.

        "h2_breed_history": "As their name implies, Norwich Terriers hail from Norwich, England, a bustling city in East Anglia (the eastern region of the country). They were bred to control the rodent population throughout Britain and were also used in packs on fox hunts, making them more social creatures than other terrier types who can be pretty independent.\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting facts about the Norwich Terrier is that they were incredibly popular in the late 19th century, when ownership of these dogs became a fad among Cambridge University students.\r\n\r\nThe American history of the Norwich Terrier began in 1914 when Frank “Roughrider\" Jones first bred them. The breed as we know it today, is likely a cross between \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/border-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBorder Terriers\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECairn Terriers\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/irish-terrier/\"\u003EIrish Terriers\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nNorwich Terriers are closely related to Norfolk Terriers, and, initially, the two were often classified as the same breed. A quick glance and it's easy to see why. Norwich and Norfolk Terriers are the same size and share the same coat colors. The only real difference between the two breeds was in their ears. The Norfolk Terrier has drop ears, which hang by the side of the head, whereas the Norwich Terrier has prick ears, which stand erect. It wasn't until 1979 when the American Kennel Club finally recognized them as separate breeds.\r\n\r\nLike their cousins the Norfolk Terrier, Norwich Terriers are also becoming a rare breed. Ready to add a Norwich Terrier puppy to your life? You can find a list of reputable breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/norwich-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club website\u003C/a\u003E. The cost is typically between $2,800 and $4,000 per puppy. For that price, your new pup should be screened for any health and temperament concerns. Older dogs may run somewhere in the ballpark of $1,000 and $2,000. Eager pet parents should be aware that the price of a Norwich Terrier won't be the only consideration. A long waitlist may be another. But patience\u003Ci\u003E is \u003C/i\u003Ea virtue.
