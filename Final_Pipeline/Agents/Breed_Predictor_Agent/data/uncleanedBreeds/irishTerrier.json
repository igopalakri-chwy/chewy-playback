Irish Terriers are friendly and playful, making them great dogs for families with children, and while they can sometimes get a little rowdy, they aren't prone to biting. They tend to be barkers and diggers, though, particularly if they don't get enough stimulation in the form of play sessions and walks. So for a well-behaved dog, it's totally worth it to take an extra couple of spins around the block to burn off that high energy.\n\nWhile Irish Terriers are exceptionally compatible with kids, they're not as thrilled with dogs and cats in the house, especially if they feel if like they're invading their territory. On the plus side, their alert and observant qualities make them natural-born watchdogs with a powerful bark that would make any intruder think twice. And, like a true canine BFF, this bearded beauty likes to be the center of your world and will happily monopolize all your attention if you let them.

The good news is that they're more determined than they are impatient, so they can definitely be trained.\n\nThis is a breed who requires mental stimulation in addition to regular exercise and chances for them to demonstrate their speed. The best training involves nose work, which lets them use their natural instincts to sniff out hidden objects, which they love! They're also keen on dog sports including agility courses and field trials. It's important to keep a watchful eye on these dynamos because they do need discipline to maintain a harmonious co-existence with their pet parents.\n\nIn general, dogs crave structure, and this is especially true for the Irish Terrier.

Limit the number of treats you offer to your dog, rewarding them for good behavior with playtime instead.

Plan on exercising your Irish Terrier for at least 20-30 minutes two or three times a day. While it might seem like your whole life is consumed with tiring out your pup at first, don't worry; once you get into an exercise routine, your Irish Terrier will be relaxed, well-behaved and loyal for life.

While their medium size makes them a decent option for small homes and apartments, keep in mind that their habitual bark may annoy the neighbors. So if you live in the country, all the better.

        "h2_breed_history": "In the rolling green fields of Ireland back in the late 1800s, Irish Terriers were as common as three-leaf clovers—and with that dense and wiry coat, even a couple hundred drizzly days a year never rained on this breed's parade. Originally bred as farm dogs, Irish Terriers quickly proved they had the brains and versatility to expand their resume, which they did in a big way by acting as watchdogs, hunting dogs and even transporting messages for the military and working as sentinels during World War I.\r\n\r\nIrish Terriers are one of the oldest terrier breeds and were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. The name \"terrier\" comes from the Latin word \"terra,\" or earth, because these dogs love to burrow and dig up rabbits and moles (but hopefully not your flower bed).\r\n\r\nCurious about their origin? Rumor has it the Irish Terrier may be a descendent of the Black and Tan Terrier, which is now extinct. Today, Irish Terriers have the trademark red coat that makes this breed so unique. While they originated in Ireland, these dogs were pretty popular in America in the 1920s, when they became the mascot of the University of Notre Dame \"Fighting Irish\" football team, a title the terriers held all the way until the '60s. No wonder this breed looks so proud!\r\n\r\nIf interested in having an Irish Terrier in your life, where do you start? You can find information on reputable breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/irish-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average price of an Irish Terrier ranges from $1,500-$3,500, depending on the breeder. Buying from a reputable breeder means you're more likely to be getting a pup with pedigree papers and who has likely been screened for health and temperament issues. You can also get in touch with Irish Terrier rescue organizations to adopt one of these distinctive dogs or get in touch with your local animal shelter.
