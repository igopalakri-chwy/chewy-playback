        "what_does_this_breed_look_like": "A Komondor puppy is born with soft fluffy curls, but as they age, Komondor dogs develop a unique coat of heavy white cords that really do resemble a mop. These pups are muscular with a robust bone structure, and when paired with their height, they have a pretty commanding presence. Komondors may often be confused with the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/puli/\"\u003EPuli\u003C/a\u003E, a dog who's also corded. Komondors are bigger (by about 10 inches) and only come in white coats. Pulis can be black, gray or white.\r\n\r\nWhile it may look like their heavy coat can get in the way of their vision and agility, that's far from the truth. Komondorok (yes, that's the plural of Komondor) are always aware of what's going on and never think twice about racing into action when it comes to protecting their loved ones. Underestimate them at your own peril!",

        "what_does_this_breed_look_like_coat_color": "\u003Cp\u003EWhile Komondor puppies are often cream colored, the breed changes color as they age, with the cream fading to white. \u003C/p\u003E",

        "h2_breed_temperament": "Komondor dogs generally have a calm and quiet temperament, but they will react when they sense strange things are afoot, and that's usually in the form of a deep, loud bark. Bred in Hungary as a flock guardian, they are devoted to their family and tend to be wary of strangers.\r\n\r\nKomondor dogs need to be properly trained and socialized. It's important to remember that, out in the fields, these dogs were largely left to their own devices when herding sheep. Over time, the Komondor breed developed a strong sense of independence.\r\n\r\nWhen properly socialized, Komondorok can do well with kids and other pets. However, without proper training, they can be reactive toward dogs they don't know, so trips to the dog park may not be a good idea. (Learn more about training and socialization below in the Training section.)\r\n\r\nLike most working dogs, Komondorok need something constructive to do. Without daily exercise or mental stimulation to keep them occupied, you may not be happy with the outcome as these large dogs can be destructive when bored.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Komondorok require the most maintenance during their first two years. After that, their cords are formed and need relatively little maintenance aside from baths and regular haircuts. And that means more time to spend on training these strong-willed dogs. Moderate exercise and a healthy diet will ensure they reach their full life expectancy.",
        "grooming": "A Komondor may look like they need a regular trip to the doggie day spa, but if bonding over manis isn't your thing, you're in luck. The cords on your Komondor dog will start to form on their own with little intervention needed. And once formed, they do not require any brushing or combing. Never brush a Komondor's cords; it prevents the cords from forming and may damage the undercoat. Shedding is not an issue with these pups, but you may want to give them a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/grooming-tools-359\"\u003Ehaircut\u003C/a\u003E from time to time to prevent those long white cords from sweeping the ground and picking up every bit of dirt and debris in their path. Particular attention should be paid to the feet and the eye area. Regular trimming should be done every one to two months.\n\nWhen it comes to grooming, bathing and drying a Komondor will likely be a bit more challenging. Fortunately, you only need to bathe your pup three or four times a year. To keep skin issues and odors at bay, pet parents will need to ensure that their Komondor is completely dry after a bath (it may take up to a day to dry completely!). If there are any signs of infection in the eye or ear area, clean the area with either \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/wipes-2448\"\u003Eeye wipes\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/wipes-2437\"\u003Eear wipes\u003C/a\u003E, and consult your vet for treatment.\n\nVets recommend that you brush your dog's teeth daily. (Pro tip: Start getting them \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Eused to the feeling\u003C/a\u003E of teeth brushing while they are puppies. Doing so will make the process exponentially easier.) And finally, while consistent brushing is important, it's equally important to have your dog's teeth cleaned by a vet at least once a year.",
        "training": "Komondorok are passionately independent and highly intelligent. For those reasons, early socialization and obedience training are crucial when raising a Komondor. Considering that they are ready and willing to act on their protective instincts, it's important they learn early on that they can trust your leadership. They need you to be calm, confident and consistent. They need to know that you'll lead them—otherwise, they may try and take over.\r\n\r\nProper socialization involves exposing puppies to different people, places and things in a controlled environment and with lots of rewards for good behavior. This helps them learn how to behave when confronted with a new person or situation when they are older.\r\n\r\nFor obedience training, it's important to stick with the words you use for basic commands (in other words, don't switch back and forth between \"stay\" and \"wait,\" for example). You also shouldn't give them a \"day off,\" where the rules don't apply. Komondorok thrive in structure.\r\n\r\nWhile training should be pretty easy with these smart cookies, do your best to keep it fun and interesting, using games or treats. This breed bores easily, and a disinterested pup won't want to follow you. If you see your dog getting bored, take a break and play a game or take them for a walk.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Like all dogs, the Komondor breed's nutritional needs will change depending on their size, age and activity level. It's important that pet parents understand their dog's particular needs for optimal nutrition and health.\r\n\r\nGenerally, Komondorok don't require any particular type of food or diet; most high-quality commercially available food for large breeds should do just fine, and it should be appropriate for your animal's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nThese dogs are large to begin with, so keep your Komondor's weight in check. It's best to have specific feeding times instead of allowing them access to their food 24/7. And while it's fun for both you and your dog when you dole out treats, remember that treats can be high in calories, all of which count toward their daily caloric intake.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure what type of food to feed your Komondor, your vet is your best resource. They can help you choose the best food for your pup based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Don't let the size of Komondorok fool you. Despite their large size and their heavy coat of hair, they are surprisingly agile and athletic. And while they'll likely spend most of their day in a stationary position and on guard, they can take off running with impressive speed if need be.\r\n\r\nKomondorok are not high-energy dogs, and as far as their exercise needs are concerned, about 30 minutes of daily exercise—one or two daily walks—is plenty. Typically, swimming is not the exercise of choice for Komondorok, as you'll find that drying them out can be a bit of a nightmare and an exercise itself for pet parents.",
        "ideal_environment": "Ideally, Komondorok should live in a home with a lot of outdoor space and a securely fenced yard. However, this breed can live in apartments and small homes as long as regular exercise is a part of the deal.\r\n\r\nKomondorok can do well in homes with children who understand boundaries, as long as the dog is well-socialized and children are taught how to respectfully and gently interact with dogs. However, they tend to be wary of strangers, so pet parents should be vigilant when visitors stop by. And while the family cat might be cool, they may neex extra training to get comfortable around other dogs.\r\n\r\nKomondorok are not heat tolerant and are better suited for colder climates. (They're clearly already well-dressed for it!)",
        "h2_breed_health": "Komondorok have a lifespan of 10 to 12 years, and while they are generally healthy, there are some health issues common to the breed. It’s important that prospective pet parents have all the information they need to understand any potential health problems that could arise.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_dg_hip_dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHip Dysplasia\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: This degenerative disease is common in many breeds of dogs, and it arises when the ball and socket of the hip do not fit together properly. Symptoms of hip dysplasia include decreased mobility, a reluctance to run, jump or climb stairs, and stiffness or limping. The treatment for hip dysplasia can range from physical therapy to joint supplements to surgery.

When this happens, the eyelashes rub on the cornea, leading to irritation. Common symptoms include excessive tearing, squinting and constant rubbing. For mild cases, a topical antibiotic may be prescribed to keep infections at bay, while moderate cases may require surgery to correct the issue. Regular ophthalmology consultations are also recommended for this breed.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/gastric-dilatation-volvulus-gdv-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGastric Bloat/Dilatation-Volvulus\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: Gastric bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus are more common in deep-chested dogs like Komondorok. Bloat may occur when your dog eats too quickly or “bolts” their food, causing a sudden influx of air into their stomach. This, in turn, can cause their stomach to distend and twist, which is often deadly if not treated immediately. To prevent gastric bloat and torsion, pet parents may be encouraged to try \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/slow-feeders-1424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E slow feeders\u003C/a\u003E.

        "h2_breed_history": "While there are many theories regarding the exact origin of Komondor, the earliest records of the breed date back to the 16th century when it's believed that these dogs first arrived in Hungary, brought there by the Magyars.\r\n\r\nBred as a working dog to guard livestock, these dogs have quite a few interesting characteristics to help them do their jobs. Their distinctive white cords allowed them to blend in with their flock of sheep, and the thick cords essentially served as armor to protect them from the sharp bites of attacking wolves.\r\n\r\nKomondorok were first brought over to America in 1933, and the American Kennel Club first recognized them in 1937. Used throughout World War II to guard military installations, the breed was almost extinct by the time the war was over. Today the Komondor is still considered a very rare breed. While the highest populations of Komondorok live in their native Hungary and the United States, there are still less than 10,000 of them.\r\n\r\nToday, life for these livestock guides has changed a bit. In the absence of a flock, Komondorok tend to use their exceptional qualities and talents to protect the people they love the most.\r\n\r\nLooking to add a Komondor to your home? The average price of a Komondor puppy is about $800 to $1,200. Of course, when you take bloodlines and lineage into consideration, the cost could be much higher.
