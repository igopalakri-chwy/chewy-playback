American Cockers were developed as a smaller companion to the English dog breed with a shorter head, a rounded skull and a more abundant coat. In 1946, the AKC recognized English and American Cockers as separate breeds.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow long do English Cocker Spaniels live?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEnglish Cocker Spaniels live, on average, between 12 and 14 years, which means a puppy can grow up to become a faithful pal for your children from kindergarten through high school.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre English Cocker Spaniels good family dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the English Cocker Spaniel makes a wonderful family pet, especially if they're socialized early. As an easy-to-train breed, this canine cutie is also quite friendly and gets along well with children and other animals in the home.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo English Cocker Spaniels bark a lot?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAn English Cocker Spaniel's barking level is moderate—so this pup won't be the loudest in the dog run. Still, every animal lets out a yip or three when startled or excited, so stick to consistent training to modulate your English Cocker's barking tendency.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo English Cocker Spaniels shed?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, English Cocker Spaniels shed a lot.
