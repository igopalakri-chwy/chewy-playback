Docking involves cutting a portion of the dog’s tail off when they are puppies. Veterinary groups along with many U.S. states and countries have banned this procedure due to medical and behavioral reasons. If you are interested in this procedure, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian. If the tail is left undocked, it can be elevated while moving, but should never curl over their back.\u003C/p\u003E",
        "h2_breed_temperament": "Entlebucher Mountain Dogs are so loyal and devoted that they won't leave your side for the next 13 years or so—seriously, they'll want to be with you 24/7. Bred to watch over cattle day and night, one of their most well-known traits is their need to be busy. These pups are at their happiest when mentally stimulated, and they want to be busy with their dog parents. If you don't give them something to do, they'll find activities all on their own—and you might not like what they pick.\n\nFor this reason, their temperament might not be everyone's cup of tea—especially for those with couch potato tendencies—but for a pet parent with an active lifestyle, the \"Swiss Army knife\" of the dog world makes an excellent companion dog.\n\nEntlebuchers are very bright dogs, meaning you can train them to do practically anything—which is where the Swiss Army knife reference comes from. But early \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E is vital for the breed. They tend to be aloof when they first meet someone, and they may be suspicious of strangers. They often prefer people don't pet them when they first meet them; they won't snarl or growl—they're very polite—but they're not thrilled to be petted as a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\"\u003ELabrador\u003C/a\u003E would be. If properly socialized, Entles do warm up quickly to other people—within minutes—so they can be social dogs, just perhaps not social butterflies.\n\nEntlebucher Mountain Dogs are good with kids once they're properly trained and socialized, but Entlebucher puppies love to play rough, so they don't make the best of companions for the littles. They're best suited for a household with older kids. They're not known for biting; rather, they're a drover breed, bred to drive the herd with their shoulders, so they might just run into you and knock you flat. (Again, socialization and training is key!) The Entlebucher breed is great with other animals from their household, and, as their pet parent, you might find yourself with more than one Entle in your life.\n\nEntles are not what you'd call an easy-going breed; they have a high drive and are a bit more high strung than other dogs, but they are less of a challenge for someone who understands canines in general. Active pet parents with some dog savvy are bound to love the Entlebucher Mountain Dog's personality.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "The Entlebucher Mountain Dog breed will thrive if you give them something to do—from agility and conformation (dog shows) to working as therapy dogs—and even more so if it means spending time with you. Entles need a moderate amount of consistent daily exercise, but they need more mental stimulation than the average dog. Not to repeat ourselves, but this breed really need things to do, and if you don't meet this need, you can bet an Entle will find something to do all on their own. (Gulp!)",
        "grooming": "The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is pretty easy when it comes to grooming—which is a small blessing considering how high maintenance they are in terms of providing them with the mental stimulation they need.\n\nBathe your Entle once a month and wipe down (with a damp towel) their short, shiny coats in between baths to keep them looking sharp. But make sure you brush them with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-bristle-brushes_c355_f70v83784\"\u003Ebristle brush\u003C/a\u003E two or three times a week—more often during the shedding season in the fall and spring—to keep their coat shiny.

Check their floppy ears for excess wax (which dogs with ears that hang down are prone to), redness or swelling, and consult your vet if you notice anything out of the ordinary. (They may suggest you \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean their ears\u003C/a\u003E.)

        "training": "There's no question that every puppy should be socialized, but Entlebuchers need a ton of socialization right upfront as part of their training. Get your Entlebucher Mountain puppy out right away: They need to go to class, walk around the block and be exposed to different things and lots of people. Don't push them on anything, though, just show them things.\r\n\r\nPuppy school is a good place to start. It teaches them how to play nicely with other puppies, and they get to hang around with other pup parents—and, in the process, learn that strangers can be nice, too! Plus, these smart cookies are usually the star of the class. They often pick things up faster than other pups (they are very intelligent), and they look at their pet parent straight away when you teach them the \"Watch me\" command, because they don't want to miss out on anything you want them to do.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are very connected with people, which makes them incredibly easy to train because they want to please you so much. In fact, because they are so focused on people, Entles make great therapy dogs. Their strongest connection, though, is with their pet parent, making this a breed you need to train yourself and not a dog you can just hand off to a handler. Make the effort with them, and you'll have a great dog—one who is deeply bonded to you and hangs on your every word.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Entlebucher Mountain Dog typically does well on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nYour veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet, but feeding your Entlebucher twice a day is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nMake sure you never leave the bowl of food out for your dog to graze all day; it's important to measure their food to avoid overfeeding. Plus, Entlebucher Mountain Dogs love to eat and can gain weight easily. This love of food is partly what makes them highly trainable: Entlebuchers are food motivated and will want to work for food. So, be sure to include all the treats you give in your mealtime plans for your pup. If you notice your pup is packing on a few more pounds than usual, talk with your vet. They can help you put together a mealtime and exercise plan to help your pup shed the extra weight and maintain their nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "The Entlebucher Mountain Dog's exercise needs are moderate, considering their energy level. They enjoy exercise, but you can keep them active by doing things with them. Like most dogs, they require a good daily walk or two and space to run, but mostly they need you to be by their side taking part in the activities. (Plan on an hour every day.) This dog breed is excellent for runners, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/the-best-dog-hiking-gear-for-hitting-the-trails-with-your-pup\"\u003Ehikers\u003C/a\u003E, bikers and anyone with an activity level as high as theirs!\n\nEntles are an all-around farm dog, and they prefer work over play, which is why they are so multi-talented and can excel at dog sports, like obedience, tracking and herding—and anything else you train them to do.",
        "ideal_environment": "Entlebucher Mountain Dogs are very sensitive to warm weather and not at all to colder temps, which is to be expected considering they're mountain dogs.\r\n\r\nThey can live in an apartment as long as you are the active type and include them in lots of your activities. Still, a large home and yard—even better if it's on a farm or lots of acres—would be infinitely more suitable.\r\n\r\nThey're good for families with children, but only if at least one pet parent is experienced with dogs and is willing and able to provide lots of time for training and engaging in activities together. This dog is a true 24/7 companion who is eager to please their family.\r\n\r\nWhen properly socialized, Entlebuchers will warm up to family friends who come over for a visit—though they may seem uninterested or even suspicious at first. And they will love and protect their furry household companions—especially if they're another Entle!",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Entlebucher Mountain Dog's origin can be traced to the Swiss Alps, more concretely to the valley of the river Entlebuch. Also known as the Entlebuch Cattle Dog, the breed was originally bred to move and guard herds before industrial agriculture came to be. Entles performed many activities, but their primary task was to drive cattle up to high pastures to feed in the summer and back down to the valley for winter. The Entlebucher's history as an all-around farm dog explains why the breed excels at so many different tasks—there's no denying that these Entlebucher qualities persist to this day.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1900s, crossbreeding with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/german-shepherd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGerman Shepherds\u003C/a\u003E and the outbreak of World War I almost caused the extinction of the Entlebucher Mountain Dog breed. However, breed standards were developed as the result of the work of several breeders, and an Entlebucher club was formed in Switzerland in 1926. The breed first came to the United States in 1975, and in 2011, the American Kennel Club recognized the Entlebucher Mountain Dog as their 170th breed.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Entlebuchers are considered a very rare breed. So, where's the best place to find an Entlebucher Mountain puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/entlebucher-mountain-dog\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E, but you'll need to be patient as puppies are not available on demand. Depending on the breeder, a puppy can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000, but the average is $1,200 to $1,400. (The higher cost is for superior pedigrees or breeding rights.) If you'd like to adopt a Entle, contact the \u003Ca href=\"https://nemda.org/\"\u003ENational Entlebucher Mountain Dog Association\u003C/a\u003E.
