They will bark to let you know if anyone is approaching their kingdom, which they'll often take to include the whole neighborhood!\n\nThey're certainly not an aggressive breed, but they're not afraid to let people and other dogs know if they've overstepped the mark. They can live in a house with kids and babies but won't necessarily want to play with them. It's not that they don't like kids; they just don't know what to do with them. Pekingese are not as playful as some other dog breeds, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\"\u003ELabrador Retriever\u003C/a\u003E, and they'd rather chill with you on the couch. If you do have kids around, make sure they know how to interact with a dog in a gentle and appropriate manner. A Pekingese may nip if their patience is tested too often. They can also live with other pets, although they may not be tolerant of a playful kitten or bouncy puppy as they get older. Because of this, it's important to start socializing your puppy early, so they get used to being around kids and other animals.\n\nPekingese are incredibly charming, and they know how to use that to their advantage. They also have a huge amount of boldness and self-esteem—traits that stem from centuries of being revered by royalty. This, combined with their small size, means it can be tempting to slack off on training, but Pekingese need an experienced pet parent who understands the need for consistency so they don't fall into bad habits, like deciding \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/new-dog/how-to-potty-train-your-dog-in-7-days\"\u003Epotty training\u003C/a\u003E isn't important.

As with all training, consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them when they potty outside. (You'll want to use the same cue words, like \"let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.)\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-how-to-make-crate-training-easy-for-your-pet-and-you\"\u003ECrate training\u003C/a\u003E is a great way to help potty train your puppy.

They're much happier sitting—preferably on their velvet cushion—and watching the world go by (with the odd bark when necessary) than running around with the other dogs. But they still need exercise and will benefit from a short walk around 20 to 30 minutes every day.\r\n\r\nSome Pekes may enjoy joining in dog sports like agility but don't expect them to win any prizes for speed, in part due to their characteristic \"rolling\" gait. This breed takes life at their own pace and won't be rushed. On hot or humid days, it's best to keep your dog inside an air-conditioned home or take your walks in the cooler parts of the day; they don't cope well with hot weather due to their short muzzles. If you're looking for an active breed to accompany you on hikes, runs or long walks, the Pekingese is likely not the dog for you.

They can be vocal watchdogs, too, so expect running commentary from your little friend.\n\nPekingese can be a little challenging to train, so they're more suited for experienced pet parents with the skills to get the best from a breed who likes to get their own way whenever possible. Pekingese prefer a quiet life without children or other pets where they can be their rightful place as the center of attention.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Pekingese breed is of Chinese origin, with legends telling us that Buddha took a lion and shrunk them into the size of a dog to create the Pekingese breed, aka the \"lion dog.\" While this might not be the true facts of how the breed came to be, we do know the Imperial Family in 8th-century China was fascinated with the breeding of small dogs. The Pekingese share their heritage with the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EShih Tzu\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPug\u003C/a\u003E in that respect. These breeds were protected by the Chinese emperors of the Peking Palace for centuries, with the Western world being unaware of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe Pekingese dog was bred to be companion dogs to Chinese nobles—only they were allowed to have them. But the dogs became ornamental as some nobles would carry their dogs in the wide sleeves of their robes, which led to the Pekingese's other nickname, \"sleeve dogs.\" These sleeve dogs also became the personal guard dogs for the nobles who carried them.\r\n\r\nThe Pekingese only came to the West after Peking (now called Beijing) was ransacked by the British in 1860. History tells us the Chinese nobility killed their dogs rather than allow them to fall into the hands of their enemies. Despite their attempts, five dogs were discovered in hiding and were removed by British troops before the Palace was burnt.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were brought to Britain and gifted to Queen Victoria, and the Pekingese dog became the favorite of another royal family. The first Pekingese came to the US in the late 1890s, and the breed was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1906. Today, these small dogs rank 96 on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/most-popular-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's popularity list\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nReady to look for a Pekingese puppy?

Pekingese puppies cost $700-$3,000. Reputable breeders should screen for health and temperament issues and may offer pedigree papers.
