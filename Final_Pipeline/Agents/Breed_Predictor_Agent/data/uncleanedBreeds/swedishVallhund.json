Vallhunds also do well with cats and other pets in the home. But while family pets get the Vallhund's love, Vallhunds take their duties as head of the neighborhood watch group seriously, and animals outside the home—whether the neighborhood cat or your neighbor's dog—may not be as welcomed.

Plus, their intelligence is off the charts, and these smart cookies learn quickly and are happily motivated by (dog) cookies or toys.

Encouragement, rewards for success and a consistent schedule are keys to acing this skill. And be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and bring treats with you. (Reward them outside; don't wait to come in.)\n\nAnd while their herding instincts may make them inclined to nip at your heels, that's a behavior you can nip in the bud with positive training—rewarding with treats, toys or praise the behavior you want (no nips) and ignoring those you don't (nipped ankles). The same goes for their chatty Cathy tendencies when they start talking (and talking, and talking ...) at inappropriate times. Talking when people enter your yard? Tell me more! Talking during a movie? Stop trying to spoil the ending!",
        "diet_nutrition": "When it comes to a Swedish Vallhund's diet, they typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). When choosing the best food, consult with your veterinarian. Your vet can give you a good idea of how much and how often to feed your pooch based on their small size and age.\r\n\r\nBecause Vallhunds are such active dogs who are always on the move, a high-protein diet may benefit them. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough treats are a great training aid with Vallhunds, remember that too much of a good thing can lead to a portly pup. While Vallhund dogs don't suffer from back problems as much as their distant cousins, the Corgis, it's important to keep them at a healthy weight (between 20 to 35 pounds) to prevent issues with mobility.",

Remember to teach your kiddos how to politely interact with your Swedish Vallhund puppy, though, before introducing them. And when raising a Swedish Vallhund puppy, socialize them to strangers to ensure they turn into a social butterfly instead of Sergeant No Fun when company visits.\r\n\r\nLike their Scandinavian forefathers, these dogs do well in cooler climates.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Swedish Vallhund origin story starts 1,000-1,200 years ago when the Vikings were exploring the world with their Spitz dogs. At some point, these dogs mixed with the Welsh Corgis in Britain and the Swedish Vallhund breed or \"Vikingarnas Dog\" was born.\r\n\r\nOriginally bred for herding cattle and other livestock, these hardy working dogs were favorites on Swedish farms until 1942, when the breed almost disappeared. It was then that Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten started the breeding program that would bring this dog back from the brink of extinction. Soon after, in 1943, the breed was officially recognized by the Swedish Kennel Club.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be long before the little Viking dogs or Vastgotaspets (as they were called in Sweden) came to the United States. In 1983, the first of several Vallhunds was brought to the US, and soon after, the first litter of Swedish Vallhund puppies was whelped by Marilyn Thell at the Jonricker Kennel in 1986. Later, the American Kennel Club officially recognized the Swedish Vallhund (literally translated to Swedish herding dog) in 2007 as its 157th breed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Swedish Vallhund breed is rarer than most, you can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/swedish-vallhund?breed=251&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average price of a Swedish Vallhund? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,400 to $2,400 for a pup. Breeders approved by the AKC typically screen their dogs for health and temperament issues; your dog will likely come with pedigree papers, too.

This unique name is based on the breed's Swedish background, and the word \"vallhund\" is Swedish for \"herding dog.\" The dog was previously known as the Vikingarnas Hund—which is quite the mouthful (and one of the many cool Swedish Vallhund facts). This phrase translated to \"Viking Dog.\"\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Swedish Vallhunds Corgis?\u003C/h3\u003E\nSwedish Vallhunds are not Corgis. They have some very similar characteristics to Welsh Corgis, but they are not the same breed. The Vallhund is thought to have originally been a cross between Scandinavian spitz dogs and Welsh Corgis. Their interbreeding occurred sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, when the Vikings raided and settled into many parts of Britain. So, Swedish Vallhunds are distant cousins to Corgis.\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Swedish Vallhunds shed?\u003C/h3\u003E\nYes, Swedish Vallhunds do tend to shed a lot. You'll find that Swedish Vallhund shedding is at its worst twice a year (fall and spring). These dogs have a thick double coat, and when the weather changes, these dogs fully shed their fluffy undercoat and will need more frequent brushing during this time. Otherwise, expect large tufts of fur to cover your couch.\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Swedish Vallhunds good family dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\nYes, Swedish Vallhund dogs are good family dogs. They get along with kids and other pets, including cats, who are part of the family. But because they were bred as herding dogs, expect a bit of nipping and nudging at your heels by your pup to keep you and your family within sight (though this can be discouraged with training).\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Swedish Vallhunds bark a lot?\u003C/h3\u003E\nYes, Swedish Vallhunds do bark a lot. This Viking herding dog may also alert you to everything from suspicious activity outside to the neighborhood cat waltzing by.\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most popular Swedish Vallhund names?\u003C/h3\u003E\nThe most popular Swedish Vallhund dog names usually allude to their Scandinavian heritage (and possibly your favorite Disney/Marvel movie), including Elsa, Anna, Astrid, Wilma, Signe, Sophie, Kristoff, Hans, Olaf, Bjorn, Thor, Odin, Loki and Axel. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/top-dog-names\"\u003EGet more dog names\u003C/a\u003E.",
