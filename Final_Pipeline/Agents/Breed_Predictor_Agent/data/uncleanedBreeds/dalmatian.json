        "h2_breed_temperament": "An outgoing personality and a curious mind are a big part of a Dalmatian's temperament. With a smart and friendly demeanor, the Dalmatian breed rates highly as a pup who's a good pick for kids. Fortunately, biting isn't a common problem with this pet, though early and consistent training is still recommended. A Dal may show wariness toward strangers; they were bred to guard and protect animals (namely horses), so teaching this canine from puppyhood to become used to new people, places and things is ideal.\n\nThe Dalmatian breed is quite competent and will pick up on the various commands and cues in \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience\u003C/a\u003E class as they love to learn and play. And if lots of exercise is added to the mix, you'll allow your Dal to work to their full potential and use their deep energy reserves. Rememberâ€”a tired dog is a happy dog!\n\nDalmatians won't be happy, however, if you leave them to play by themselves in the backyard. These active pups need human companionship and want to be active \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E. Be sure you include them in all your fun.\n\nOther important Dalmatian qualities include a playful nature and the ability to get along with cats and other dogs in the home. But because they're so high energy, space to run and roam is important. A Dalmatian dog is best served in a home with access to outdoor space, a yard or large dog run where they can frolic.\n\nDalmatian intelligence is apparent as this dog's backstory is one of extensive service. Bred to trot alongside horse-drawn carriages, they've worked closely with firefighters, marched in parades and even taken a turn in the spotlight as a circus dog. The Dalmatian is truly one of a kind.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Gym rats welcome! The Dalmatian breed was bred to run and enjoys every kind of exercise and game a pup parent can think of. And grooming's a breeze, leaving time for yet \u003Ci\u003Eanother\u003C/i\u003E walk and extra rounds of training sessions.",
        "grooming": "A Dalmatian's grooming requirements are as easy as can be and indeed much lower when compared to other dogs. Although a Dal's short, dense coat sheds moderately, grooming them is relatively low maintenance. Simply brush them once a week, either with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/glove-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83788\"\u003Emitt\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-curry-brushes_c355_f70v83786\"\u003Erubber curry comb\u003C/a\u003E to remove dead hair.\n\nMonthly \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enail trimming\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebaths\u003C/a\u003E are also part of caring for a Dalmatian, though their nails may not need as much clipping if your pup runs a lot on pavement (this hard surface does some of the filing work for you). You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear those nails tapping on hard surfaces.\n\nFor fresh doggy breath, make a point of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrushing your Dal's teeth daily\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;to remove sticky residue and keep the teeth healthy. Your vet can give you pointers if you're a new pet parent. And once a year, visit the vet for a pro cleaning.\n\nLastly, be sure to peer inside those floppy ears so you can check for any waxy buildup, redness or swelling. If you spy anything out of the ordinary, contact your vet, who may advise you to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean their ears\u003C/a\u003E.",
        "training": "Good news! Training your Dalmatian isn't going to be an uphill battle as this breed tends to be both agreeable and very intelligent. Still, a Dal's need for consistent, right-from-the-start obedience classes is on the high side. Bear in mind that the Dalmatian breed is known to be sensitive, so use a language they understand: positive rewards like yummy treats, lots of praise and special toys usually do the trick.\n\nPart of the reason to start obedience school early is to introduce your Dal to as many new experiences and environments as possible. With proper \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E, your pet will have nothing to fear when there's a knock at the door, or they meet a new pal at the dog run. You'll have smoothed the way and ensured a polite pup who's happy in any type of situation.",
        "diet_nutrition": "As for a Dalmatian's food, this pup type typically does well on a high-quality commercial chow, but if you think a feeding chart may help you when it comes to the right amount to scoop and serve, check in with your vet. And when shopping for dog food, always take your pet's age and stage into account, whether you have a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/the-ages-and-stages-of-dog-food-from-puppy-to-adult-to-senior\"\u003Epuppy, adult or senior dog\u003C/a\u003E at home.\n\nFeel like prepping your pup's food yourself? This is another area that needs the vet's approval to be sure the dishes you're mixing up match your Dalmatian's energy level and nutrition needs. As you get busy in the kitchen, keep in mind that table scraps are only to be given very occasionally, if at all. The reason? These bits may be too fatty or bony for a Dal to consumeâ€”and certain items are actually dangerous to canines. It's a good idea to memorize or at least post the list of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/toxic-foods-for-pets\"\u003Ehuman foods that shouldn't be given to dogs\u003C/a\u003E where you can see it often.\n\nLastly, while training treats are a necessary part of obedience work, don't overdo them. Your Dalmatian's weight should be kept steady, and a diet of too many tasty snacks can cause obesity. If you have any questions about your pup's meal plan, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to provide guidance specific to your pet.",
        "exercise": "A Dalmatian's exercise needs are intense, and their energy levels are among the highest of all the dog breeds. This pup can seemingly run nonstop, which means you can easily bring your spotted pet along when training for a five-mile run or on an all-day hike. (Be sure to work your pup up to longer, more intense outings, thoughâ€”just like you would!)\r\n\r\nAs for regular walks in the park and neighborhood, strive for three to four a day for at least 30 minutes each (totaling two hours a day). This special dog breed is also down to play, so consider some ball tossing fun when you exercise your Dalâ€”they love a good game of fetch or hide-and-seek.\r\n\r\nA word of caution with a Dalmatian puppy: A young canine's bones and joints don't reach peak maturity until 2 years of age, so be careful not to over-exercise your youthful dog during this important growth period.",
        "ideal_environment": "A Dalmatian's ideal environment is one that features a vigorous, energetic familyâ€”and that family can be just you or with kidsâ€”and lots of activity. Mixing a Dal with kids, other dogs and even cats is perfectly acceptable; in fact, this breed rates highly as a human companion and family pet. But make sure consistent training is in place so that a Dal's behavior is in check from the start. This early introduction to obedience will come in handy if you love to entertain, as your Dalmatian puppy will be used to new people coming and going in the house.\r\n\r\nSince Dalmatian speed and their love of exercise is well-established, small homes and apartments may not be suitable unless the pet parent is able to take their Dal out frequently for walks and playtime every day. In short, a house with access to lots of outdoor space is best. First-time pet parents are a fine fit as this pup's intelligence allows for training success for those dedicated to the task.",
        "h2_breed_health": "While Dalmatians have a lifespan of 11 to 13 years, they are prone to certain health issues. But that shouldnâ€™t stop you from opening your heart to a Dal. Armed with knowledge about these health concerns, you can help your pup live the longest life possible.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeafness\u003C/strong\u003E: Unfortunately, some Dal dogs lose their hearing within the first several weeks of life. While more Dalmatians are deaf in only one ear (13.4%) than in both ears (4.4%), overall \u003Ca href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32543777/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eapproximately 17.8% of Dalmatians have some deafness\u003C/a\u003E. This trait is likely inherited, and is more commonly seen in Dalmatians with blue eyes. While thereâ€™s no treatment for hearing loss, dogs with deafness can still have great quality of life and live happy lives.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBladder Stones\u003C/strong\u003E: Due to a genetic mutation that causes Dals to secrete elevated uric acid into their blood and urine, urinary stones may develop in the bladder. A dog with this condition may strain to urinate or show blood in the urineâ€”and in some cases, a stone may block the bladder completely, which leaves them unable to urinate and is a life-threatening emergency. Bladder stones may be treated surgically. Dogs whoâ€™ve had stones are often treated with a prescription diet to prevent them from reoccurring.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cardiovascular/enlarged-heart-dilated-cardiomyopathy-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDilated Cardiomyopathy\u003C/a\u003E (DCM)\u003C/strong\u003E: DCM is a heart condition in which the heart is enlarged so the heart muscle is thin and weak. Symptoms can include cough, trouble breathing, heart murmur and lethargy. If your vet suspects your pet may have a heart condition, they may refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDalmatian Bronzing Syndrome\u003C/strong\u003E: In this genetic skin condition, Dalmatians develop pink to bronze skin discolorations around the nose and mouth. Hair loss and inflammation at the hair follicle is also noted. Treatment may include special shampoos, topical or oral medication, or special diets.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
        "h2_breed_history": "When reaching back to determine the Dalmatian's history, the results are sort of murky. Indeed, the Dalmatian's origin has roots all over the globeâ€”in Europe, Asia \u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E Africaâ€”but one region near the Adriatic Sea, Dalmatia, can claim proper credit for this dog's eventual name.\r\n\r\nDalmatians are closely associated with their special skills, including that of coach dogs, which means these animals were tasked to keep the pace of horse-drawn carriages as well as protect their equine pals at rest. The British also became enamored of the attractive Dalmatian, putting them to work in livery stables.\r\n\r\nAlong with steady work as a shepherd dog, draft dog, coach and carriage dog and even as a circus performer, the Dal's position as a firehouse mascot is probably the most well-known, and New York City firefighters started the tradition. In the early days, horses pulled the fire trucks, and Dalmatians cleared the path in front of the horses on their way to fight fires.\r\n\r\nDalmatians are also patriotic pups, making appearances alongside the Budweiser Clydesdales in various parades, and they've been forever immortalized in the classic Disney cartoon movie \"101 Dalmatians.\"\r\n\r\nRecognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888, this prized pup no longer has to toil with farm animals to earn their keep. Instead, the friendly and intelligent breed is happy at home, especially if they can run and runâ€”and then run some more.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to add this cute pup to your household, keep in mind that Dalmatian prices are about $1,500. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
