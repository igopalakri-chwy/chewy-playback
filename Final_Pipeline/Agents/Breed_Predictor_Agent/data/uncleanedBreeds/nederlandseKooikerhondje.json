Puppy \"mouthing\" and biting are also 100 percent to be expected, but with proper training and socialization, they fade away as they grow up.\n\nYour Kooiker will match you wit for wit. At times, you may look into those expressive eyes and see a challenge brewing. (Just who's really in charge here?) Just like a parent would when a child starts testing them, a pup parent needs to stay firm and not be swayed by their cuteness. Your ultimate goal is to make sure your pup knows you're protecting them and not the other way around.\n\nKooikers need to be busy, and they love it when you give them a job to do.

Structure with a capital \"S\" is important for this breed as they love to wander on \"sniffaris.\" (So many things to smell!)\n\nYou'll need a lot of patience and positive motivations to keep your dog on track. Use lots of praise, toys and treats to reward your pup. And everyone who lives with the Kooiker must be included in training—it's all hands on deck! Harness their intelligence, make training matter, and you'll be rewarded with a lifetime of successes and laughs.",
        "diet_nutrition": "A complete and balanced diet is important to satisfy your Nederlandse Kooikerhondje's nutritional needs. Look for a high-quality dog food that fits your pup's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you choose a formula that's best for your individual dog. They can also help you set the portions and times for your pet's meals.\r\n\r\nBecause Kooikers love learning new things, you'll be doling out lots of treats as they learn new tricks. But treat calories count, too! Your vet can help you factor in all those delicious snacks in their overall meal plan, so they stay at a healthy weight. And of course, make sure you have clean, fresh water available for your pup throughout the day.",
        "exercise": "Because Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes are so independent, exuberant and energetic, you will need to work your way into their good graces, gain their cooperation and show them a good time. Given the task they were originally bred to perform—duck hunting in the Netherlands—this streak of self-sufficiency and demand for activity should come as no surprise. And they'll \"demand\" at least an hour of exercise every day. The key is to keep their lively spirits high by engaging them with challenging tasks and activities that stimulate their sense of purpose and playfulness.\n\nYou can take them on long walks or jogs, but it's a good idea to mix it up to keep it interesting, so add games like “Find the Treat\" (to practice scent work), Frisbee or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E (retrieving).

(And your pup will love it.)\n\nCreating opportunities for activities that play to their natural instincts will help them feel like they've accomplished a “job well done,\" and that they are pulling their weight as a part of the family.",
        "ideal_environment": "For the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje, home-sweet-home has a fenced back yard for exercise and adventure. Prepare to fully engage with this “play with me\" breed and know that, while the dog loves children, they'd prefer to be playing outside. So, tie those two things together and you've got a match made in canine heaven.\r\n\r\nKooikers are affectionate and sensitive companions to their people, but they like routine and quiet, which is why they tend to fare better in households without little ones who may surprise them with middle-of-the-night crying, unpredictability and disorder.\r\n\r\nEven still, they are often referred to as a family dog. These pups are happiest when they're included as part of a family of older children who embraces a mantra of mutual respect. As with any dog, it's important to socialize and train a dog as well as teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nHaving a Kooiker as a pet is rewarding, but you'll need to devote a fair amount of time to them. They will want to be with you, do things with you and be of service to you. They need space, socialization and ample opportunities to show off their smarts and their skills.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje originated in the Netherlands, possibly dating as far back as the 1700s—you can find them in paintings by Rembrandt and Jan Steen. These plucky pups were bred for duck hunting and were called duck decoys—but not because they look like the wooden lures used by hunters today. They were (and still are) used by hunters to lure ducks through elaborate \"canal cages\" called \u003Ci\u003Eeendenkooi\u003C/i\u003E (\"duck cages\" in Dutch) into traps. Kooikers also alerted their families to poachers on the property and kept the property free of vermin. It's a similar job to that of the\u003Ci\u003E \u003C/i\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever/\"\u003ENova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\u003C/a\u003E, the North American breed said to be descendants of the Kooiker.\r\n\r\nBecause of their heritage, Kooikers are often referred to as Dutch spaniels. The breed nearly died out after World War I, when more accurate rifles were available to duck hunters. But the breed was saved by Baroness von Hardenbroek van Ammerstol in the late 1930s, when she sought out the little dogs throughout the Dutch countryside and brought them back from the brink of extinction. The Dutch are so attached to their canine counterpart that they've kept a breeding registry of all the litters bred since 1942.\r\n\r\nThe first Nederlandse Kooikerhondje litter was born in the US in 1999, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nkcusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENederlandse Kooikerhondje Club of the United States\u003C/a\u003E was formed in 2014. The breed officially joined the ranks of the American Kennel Club in 2018.\r\n\r\nWhere can you find a Nederlandse Kooikerhondje puppy? You can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/nederlandse-kooikerhondje\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average price for a Kooiker puppy? You can expect to spend between $1,000-$5,000 for a Kooiker puppy. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact Nederlandse Kooikerhondje rescues, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.",
