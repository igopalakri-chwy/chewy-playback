With their distinctive flat faces (they're what's known as a brachycephalic breed), silky double coat and a \"lion's mane\" around their necks, Tibbies demand attention (which they love), despite their petite stature.

        "h2_breed_temperament": "Tibetan Spaniels may be small in size, but they lack for nothing regarding their personality. Their temperament is often described as \"a big dog trapped in a small dog's body.\" It's easy to see why. Tibbies are not wallflowers. They are smart, assertive and affectionate, and they \u003Ci\u003Elove\u003C/i\u003E attention, so you better be prepared to give it freely. (With a cute face like theirs, how could you not?) But in return, Tibbies are your most loyal \"little lion,\" as the monks in Tibet called them.\r\n\r\nWhat Tibbies don't need is a lot of exercise. Their short height, stubby legs and flat faces don't set them up to be extreme athletes of any sort. That said, they do love to play and zip around the yard or go for walks and even short jogs if that's what you're into (they can be speedier than you'd think). Because most of all, Tibbies are social, chummy creatures who want to please their people and are happy to flex to your needs. And, of course, all dogs need some exercise to stay healthy and keep their weight in check. Tibbies, in particular, are prone to becoming overweight, which comes as no surprise since they find food and treats highly enticing.\r\n\r\nTibbies' calm and gentle nature makes them great therapy dogs, and they get along well with just about anyone in the home—from children to other dogs or cats. In fact, they're sometimes even compared to cats (but, please, don't tell them, they are sensitive). It's not just that they resemble miniature lions; they also love a good window view—especially from on top of your furniture—and they even groom themselves with the same fastidious attention to detail.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Part of what makes the Tibetan Spaniel breed such a wonderful pet is that these dogs are, for all their princely appearance, pretty low maintenance. They are easily adaptable to many kinds of homes, and don't require a ton of exercise. Shedding can be an issue, but regular brushing will keep it in check. Their quick wit can make training tricky, so it's important to start early.",
        "grooming": "Although it may surprise you, given all the fancy feathering and plumage that comes standard on a Tibetan Spaniel, they don't need fancy styling like the highly coifed \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/poodle/\"\u003EPoodle\u003C/a\u003E. It's quite easy to manage a Tibetan Spaniel dog's grooming needs at home.\n\nWhile they do shed, if you're on top of brushing them about once a week, it's manageable. And a variety of brushes will do, including a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nWhen it comes to bathing your Tibbie, every four to six weeks should be sufficient, especially if your pup leads a relatively low-key, mud-free lifestyle. Just as with human hair, over-bathing can strip their fur of the essential oils that keep it healthy.\n\nLike bathing, you should trim your Tibbie's nails every four to six weeks, or whenever you see them start to curl or hear that click-click-click on your floors. (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003EGet the how-to here\u003C/a\u003E.) And, city dwellers, rejoice: Walking your dog regularly on concrete helps file their nails naturally.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003ETeeth brushing\u003C/a\u003E every day is a must. If you don't, the plaque build-up in their mouths will solidify into tartar and no amount of brushing after the fact will remove it. #Gross. In conjunction with brushing, you can also use dental treats approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC). Vets can give you the full 101 on teeth brushing and teach you how to do this. It's best to start dogs as puppies so they'll get used to it faster. And be sure to have their teeth professionally cleaned by your vet every year.",
        "training": "Training a Tibetan Spaniel is not a particularly difficult task, as these dogs are quite bright and eager to please. Building a solid bond while raising a Tibbie will also help your training efforts—it only makes them want to please you more. But with all their intelligence comes an independent streak. This means if they've decided they don't want to complete a task or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome when called\u003C/a\u003E, well, then, good luck to you. So start your training when your Tibbie's a puppy. If you do and are consistent, these pups can be pretty easy to train and can even excel at dog sports like agility, obedience and rally (similar to obedience, but the handlers can encourage their dogs along the course).\n\nThe Tibetan Spaniel breed also tends to be highly food motivated, so using treats as a reward can be effective. Treats can help them focus on you and help you lure them into specific positions with cues. And positive reinforcement (using treats, toys and praise) is an essential component of teaching these happy, responsive dogs to do what you ask.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Tibetan Spaniel breed typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose the type of formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). A \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/small-breeds-dry-dog-food_c294_f6v13790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esmall-kibble food\u003C/a\u003E is likely to suit these diminutive guys and gals best. Your vet can help you determine exactly how much and how often to feed your Tibbie to meet their nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nYou do need to take some care with your pup's food because obesity can be a concern for these homebodies. If your dog's weight does begin to balloon, you might see an adverse effect on their orthopedic health. They don't have great knees to begin with, and excess weight is no friend to them, wreaking havoc on their joints and even causing arthritis. This doesn't mean you've got to go diet-crazy. You may not necessarily need to feed them just an old-school low-fat kibble, either. It does mean you must, like a Jedi, resist all their table-scrap begging and keep track of how many treats you dole out. If you have any questions about what (or how much) you should be feeding your pup, talk with your vet. They're in the best position to help you make good choices for your Tibbie based on their unique needs.",
        "exercise": "On a scale of couch potato to Iron Man competitor, the Tibetan Spaniel's exercise needs veer more closely to the former. Sometimes quite literally—they can seem almost feline in their love of a good spot on the couch (especially one with an outside view). That's not to say they won't go for a walk or don't enjoy them. They do, and one or two a day will suit the Tibetan Spaniel's energy level quite well (totaling about 30 to 60 minutes). Despite their short legs, they might even go on a brief jog. However, Tibbies are brachycephalic (they have that distinctively flat face); their airways are obstructed because of their face shape, which makes it difficult to breathe, so endurance athletes they are not. And when they're done, they're \u003Ci\u003Edooone\u003C/i\u003E. Their strong-willed streak is real. You didn't really need to run that marathon did you?\r\n\r\nA fenced-in yard is highly useful, as they love to zoom about and play a rousing game of fetch—Tibbies are crazy about their toys. And sunbathing, too. Sure, they're from Tibet with its often punishing weather, but unless it's scorching out, the calm Tibbie breed needs their downtime to soak up some rays. No spray tan required.",
        "ideal_environment": "Tibetan Spaniels adapt well to any loving home, whether that's with a single person in a small city apartment, an elderly person confined to a wheelchair or a family living in the country with room to roam. They get along well with other dogs and cats, too. Tibbies are easy-going pups, so they mix well with kids. That said, a rambunctious home of four or five children might not be ideal. Having been originally raised by monks in Tibetan monasteries, they are calm dogs and accustomed to a peaceful, quiet existence.\r\n\r\nExperienced and first-time pet parents alike can thrive with a Tibetan Spaniel puppy whether they lead an active or mellower lifestyle. What's key is a willingness to snuggle—Tibbies \u003Ci\u003Elove\u003C/i\u003E their humans, not extensive alone time—and allowing free access to your furniture. Because—try as you might—you won't keep them off of it. They're also great in the snow, but when the sun is blazing, they'll opt for shade or, better yet, a sweet spot inside under the air conditioning vent.",
        "h2_breed_health": "The Tibetan Spaniel lifespan is 12 to 15 years, and they are a relatively healthy breed. Still, they may be susceptible to a few genetic problems, some of which, especially the orthopedic conditions, are not uncommon in small breeds.

        "h2_breed_history": "The origin of Tibetan Spaniels is—surprise!—in Tibet, where Buddhist monks bred them as sentinels. There, Tibbies settled high on monastery walls to keep a keen eye out for approaching allies or enemies. When they caught sight of someone, their distinctive, throaty bark would alert their (much larger) buddies, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/tibetan-mastiff/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ETibetan Mastiffs\u003C/a\u003E, down below, who would then pounce, if needed, chasing intruders away. To this day, their unique history endures as one of the stand-out traits of Tibetan Spaniels, as they still make fine watchdogs. But let's be clear: they're never going to be your bouncer, but they'll sure as heck let you know when someone's at the door.\r\n\r\nWhen they were off duty, these dogs served their monks as companions and, smartly, bed warmers—a clutch move in the Himalayas where winter temps regularly dip below zero. The monks referred to their dogs as \"little lions\" not only because of their appearance but also because lions were sacred symbols of Buddha. These mini leos were so prized that they were never sold, only gifted to noble or prestigious rulers and leaders in China and other Buddhist nations. If they moved, it was from a monastery to a palace.\r\n\r\nTibetan Spaniels, as it turns out, are not actually spaniels. That part of their breed name came from the French word \u003Cem\u003Eepagnuel\u003C/em\u003E, which referred to a companion and comfort dog in the Middle Ages. Tibbies came to England in the late 19th century, but not many were bred until after World War II. They arrived in the United States in the late 1960s, and the American Kennel Club recognized them in 1983 as part of the Non-Sporting group (the category of dogs who don't neatly fit into another group).\r\n\r\nYou can find Tibbies to purchase by checking out a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/tibetan-spaniel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average price for a Tibetan Spaniel puppy is about $2,000. Good breeders should provide two to three sets of vaccinations before releasing their puppies, so they should be at least 12 weeks old and include a health guarantee.

Tibbies only mat behind their ears and on their rear fringes, so a good comb is necessary. They don't need haircuts or professional grooming, and the only trimming they need is under their feet for cleanliness.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Tibetan Spaniels good family dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nAbsolutely, Tibetan Spaniels are good family dogs. These dogs form deep bonds with their humans, and they love children. It is important, however, to teach kids to respect Tibbies and not be too rough with them. They are small dogs, but they have long memories.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C/b\u003ECan Tibetan Spaniels be left alone?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nYes, Tibetan Spaniels can be left alone, but one of the quintessential characteristics of these furry friends is that they most enjoy being with their families. They're super not interested in a lot of alone time. FOMO is real. No dog should be left alone for more than a few hours at a time anyway.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow long do Tibetan Spaniels live?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nTheir life expectancy is 12 to 15 years giving you a lot of time to create many wonderful memories.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Tibetan Spaniels bark a lot?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nTibetan Spaniels do not bark a lot. They do bark, and theirs is a distinctive one—quick and deep—but they are not yappy. They bark to alert you when they sense something is going on or when someone is approaching, which is what makes them such great security dogs.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most common Tibetan Spaniel mixes?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nThe most common\u003Cb\u003E \u003C/b\u003ETibetan Spaniel mixes are:\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003ETibetan Spaniel-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pomeranian/\"\u003EPomeranian\u003C/a\u003E mix (Tibetan Pom)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003ETibetan Spaniel-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/chihuahua/\"\u003EChihuahua\u003C/a\u003E mix (Tibetan Spaniel Chihuahua)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003ETibetan Spaniel-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pekingese/\"\u003EPekingese\u003C/a\u003E mix (Tibetan Spaniel Pekingese)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003ETibetan Spaniel-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/\"\u003EShih Tzu\u003C/a\u003E mix (Tibetan Spaniel Shih Tzu)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003ETibetan Spaniel-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/dachshund/\"\u003EDachshund\u003C/a\u003E mix (Tibetan Spaniel Dachshund)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\nNote: These are not purebred dogs but mixed breeds.",
