They are not independent dogs, preferring to be included in all your fun. Leos are very loyal and sensitive to your mood; if you need a hug, they'll likely want one, too. Their gentleness and sensitive nature make them excellent therapy dogs, as they're willing to share their love and gentleness with everyone, not just their family.\n\nLeos aren't known to be aggressive or biters, but they need \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E starting when they're puppies to bring out their naturally friendly nature. If they're not socialized as puppies, these dogs may become wary around new people and situations.\n\nLeos love kids and are great playmates, but you'll need to supervise them around small kids and babies. This giant-sized dog weighs well over 100 pounds, and they have a strong tail. One happy wag in the wrong direction could topple a tiny tot.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "The Leonberger breed is a very large dog with very large care needs. With their thick, double coat, it should come as no surprise that they're heavy shedders, and their fur will need a lot of care to prevent matting, too. These pups have a lot of energy and need a lot of training, as well. So, you'll be spending a lot of time with your pup every day—and that's just how you both prefer it.",
        "grooming": "The Leonberger has a thick double coat and is a super-shedder, so they require daily brushing using a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E to get down to the undercoat to remove all the mats. You may want to add an additional brushing where you dedicate serious time (30 to 60 minutes) to really brush through the fur and make sure your pup's coat is tangle-free. Many dog parents find it helpful to brush the coat backwards first to get next to the skin, then follow with a brush in the direction of the hair growth. In the spring and fall, when the Leo sheds their coat, use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/stainless-steel-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f7v17020#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emetal comb\u003C/a\u003E and an undercoat \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/rake-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Erake\u003C/a\u003E in addition to the pin brush to deal with all the fur that will be flying.\n\nYour Leo will need a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebath\u003C/a\u003E about every four to six weeks, unless they've been trekking through the mud. In between baths, you should be able to maintain their water-resistant coats with regular brushing.\n\nTheir \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enails will need to be trimmed\u003C/a\u003E about every two to three weeks, if not worn down naturally by all your outdoor fun. You'll know they're ready for a trim when you can hear your dog click-clacking on your kitchen floors.\n\nLeo's need their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eteeth brushed\u003C/a\u003E daily. Start when your Leonberger's a puppy, so they'll get used to it faster. Regular brushing will help keep tartar and plaque at bay and prevent other health issues, like heart disease, as they age. Your pup will need an annual cleaning by your vet, too.",
        "training": "The Leonberger dog is super-smart and eager to learn, which can make them enjoyable to train. However, when they hit their adolescence, they can sometimes think they're smarter than you and become a bit willful during training. This, coupled with the dog's massive size and energy levels, make them better suited to someone who's trained a dog before. These traits can be super frustrating to someone working with their very first dog.\n\nStart your Leonberger puppy with the basic obedience commands, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E. Learning how to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewalk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E is important for your Leo to learn, too. These dogs were used to pull carts, so they're strong. If your adult pup takes off while on a walk, you may risk injuring your shoulder. So, teach them proper leash etiquette while they're a puppy—your dog and your arm will thank you. The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-off\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eoff\u003C/a\u003E command may also be beneficial to help keep your 170-pound dog off your furniture or bed.\n\nSocialization is important, even for friendly pups like the Leonberger. Get them used to meeting new people, pups and situations to help them realize this is a perfectly normal part of life as they grow up. Take your puppy on walks and let them meet and sniff the people and dogs you meet. Enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new adults all under one roof.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Leonbergers usually do well with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E for large-breed dogs. Be sure to choose a formula for your dog's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though the Leonberger dog is very active, be careful not to overfeed your pup. Extra weight adds extra stress to their bones, and obesity can lead to other health concerns like arthritis or heart disease down the road. As you plan mealtimes, don't forget to include all the treats you'll give during training and just because you love your dog—those calories count, too.\r\n\r\nLeonbergers are at risk of bloat, which can be life-threatening. To protect your pup, consider feeding your dog smaller portions throughout the day using a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/slow-feeders-1424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eslow feeder bowl\u003C/a\u003E, and avoid strenuous exercise for an hour before and after mealtimes.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your dog's diet or feeding schedule, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you choose the right food for your pup based on their unique situation.",
        "exercise": "The Leonberger is an extra-large dog with extra-large exercise needs. This high-energy pup needs at least two hours of exercise spread throughout the day. A happy Leo is a tired Leo, and if your pup doesn't get the energy-releasing activity they crave, they'll come up with their own entertainment—such as destroying your favorite pair of running shoes (among other things).\n\nWhile long walks are good, be sure to mix it up so your pup doesn't get bored. Your Leo will love joining you for a morning jog, a weekend hike (so many things to smell and discover!) and games of Frisbee or fetch in the backyard. They're good swimmers and will enjoy splash time in a lake, pond or pool; in fact, they're well-suited to jobs as water rescue dogs. Be sure to reserve those more strenuous exercises, like jogging, until they're fully grown (around 2 years old). Their growing bones and joints need TLC, and that type of exercise may be too much for a puppy. Check with your vet before starting up a new activity.\n\nIf you've got a competitive streak, your Leo would love to join you in dog sports. They're great at agility courses and drafting, where they use their strong bodies to pull a cart competitively. (They were used to pull ammunition carts during both World Wars.) You two will have fun bonding over these fun sports, and who knows? You may come home with some fancy winning ribbons.\n\nDon't forget to exercise your pup's mind, too. After you've mastered the basics of obedience, teach your dog fun tricks, like play dead and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-commands-shake-a-paw\"\u003Eshake\u003C/a\u003E (instant party pleasers!). And leave a few \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E around the house for them to solve.",
        "ideal_environment": "The Leonberger is a giant breed who needs lots of room to speed around. They were bred to work on farms, so they're most at home in wide, expansive spaces. If you don't have oodles of acres for this pup to roam around, a fenced backyard will do nicely. With their giant size and really high energy levels, apartment living may be more challenging for these pups. Apartment-dwellers committed to spending lots of time outdoors every day may be able to make it work, though.\r\n\r\nBecause of their size and energy levels, these dogs are better suited for experienced pet parents who've trained a dog before. First-timers may find this pup a lot to handle and may get frustrated.\r\n\r\nThese gentle lions are family dogs and aren't meant for independent living. They need to be included in all the family fun. They thrive with an active family who's busy outdoors and wants a furry companion to bring with them on all their adventures.\r\n\r\nLeos are great with kids, but you'll want to supervise them around smaller children. With their large size and tail that's bound to be wagging, they may accidentally knock over a toddler. They do well with other dogs in the home, but watch out for smaller pups—they may accidentally injure them, too. Leos can do well with cats, as long as they're raised with them from puppyhood.",
        "h2_breed_health": "The Leonberger can live a healthy and happy life for such a large dog, with a life expectancy of 7 years.

Bloat can be a life-threatening condition, so get to your vet immediately if you think your pup has symptoms. As a preventative measure, your vet can perform surgery to stitch the stomach to the side of the body (prophylactic gastropexy). You can also potentially help prevent bloat by avoiding exercising your dog immediately after eating and giving smaller meals throughout the day with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/slow-feeders-1424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eslow feeding bowl\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDysplasia\u003C/strong\u003E: As large dogs, Leonbergers are prone to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_dg_hip_dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehip\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_dg_elbow_dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eelbow dysplasia\u003C/a\u003E.

        "h2_breed_history": "Unlike most other working dogs, which are typically bred for physical labor, the Leonberger was bred to be a companion for European royalty. The breed was founded by Heinrich Essig, a 19th century politician and entrepreneur of Leonberg, Germany. He crossed large working breeds such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/saint-bernard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESaint Bernards\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/newfoundland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENewfoundlands\u003C/a\u003E, and their offspring served rulers such as Napoleon III, Tsar Alexander II of Russia and the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII of the United Kingdom).\r\n\r\nThe Leonberger has also graced households of elites, including composers Richard Wagner and Sergei Rachmaninoff and the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi. Over time, Leonbergers became working-class dogs who served on farms and other less aristocratic households. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010 and is the club's 167th breed.\r\n\r\nSo where's the best place to find a Leonberger puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/leonberger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The cost of a Leo is between $2,000 and $4,000 which is on the higher end of the scale for the price of a puppy, but oh so worth it!
