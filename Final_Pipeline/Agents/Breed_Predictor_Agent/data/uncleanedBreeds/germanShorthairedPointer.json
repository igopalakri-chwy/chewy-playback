GSPs love to work and love the interaction they receive from you, so training allows them to accomplish both at the same time.\n\nThese dogs were bred to hunt, which means they're easily distracted by all the things they smell and see to chase. You might think they are scatterbrained or are uninterested in training; they're just really fascinated by what's going on around them. To help them stay focused, keep training sessions short, use delicious treats to hold their attention on you and take lots of play breaks before either of you get frustrated. Their easily distracted nature is why they're better suited to an experienced pup parent and may be too frustrating for first-timers.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003ESocialization\u003C/a\u003E, aka exposing your dog to new people, places and objects, can't be ignored, either. GSPs are usually good with people and dogs, but make sure you get them out to meet new people (and have people over) frequently. Take your German Shorthaired Pointer puppy on walks, so they can meet people and other dogs in the neighborhood, and enroll them in puppy preschool. Here, they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.",

Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for a statement of the food's packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though your pup's got a lot of energy to burn, you need to be careful not to overfeed them—and that includes the treats you give during training (or just because you love them). Overfeeding your pup can lead to health issues, including obesity, heart disease and arthritis. If you notice that your dog has gained an extra pound or two, contact your vet. They can help you create a diet and exercise plan to help your pup shed the extra weight and still get the nutrition they need.",

LET'S GO!\"\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointer dogs have the need for speed built into them, and they have high exercise needs. Many will benefit from two exercise sessions every day, in the mornings and evenings, instead of one long play session. They'll need 60-90 minutes of energy-burning play each day. If you don't give your dog the activity they need, your pup may chew your shoes or your couch to entertain themselves.\n\nInclude informal activities like fun games of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E or tug-of-war and romping in the backyard, as well as more adventurous outside-the-home exercises like walking, hiking or jogging, or dog sports like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E or dock diving.\n\nRemember your dog's mental exercise needs, too! Mental stimulation is also incredibly important because this breed is so intelligent. You can hide treats in old Chewy boxes and let them sniff out a snack or keep a few \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E around for them to solve.",

Anyone considering bringing a GSP into their life for a companion should also be very active. Homes with large, fenced yards are ideal, as they give the dog plenty of space to safely run around off-leash. And because of their exercise needs and loud barks (even though they don't bark a lot), they may not be suitable for close-living situations, like apartments or condos.\r\n\r\nGSPs are a lovely breed who are very affectionate with their families, whether it's just you or a large family with kids. They like to be part of all the activity, whether it's a fun game of fetch or an enthusiastic Frisbee battle in the park. GSPs are generally great with kids and other dogs. With proper socialization, they can be fine around strangers and guests. And it always helps to teach kids how to properly interact with dogs.

        "h2_breed_history": "The German Shorthaired Pointer's place of origin is Germany (no surprise there), where the breed was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early days of their history, breeders wanted a brilliant, versatile hunting dog who could do it all—point, flush and retrieve. This idea appealed to hunters who couldn't keep and care for multiple dogs to fulfill each purpose. Early breeders used several breeds (such as the German Bird Dog, the Spanish Pointer and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pointer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEnglish Pointer\u003C/a\u003E) to fulfill that goal, and the German Shorthaired Pointer was developed. Naturally, the impressively useful GSP was widely appealing.\r\n\r\nThe breed came to the United States in the 1920s, and the first litter of German Shorthaired Pointers born in the US arrived in 1925. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in the 1930s, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.gspca.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGerman Shorthaired Pointer Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was established shortly thereafter. Today, the breed's popularity is firmly established in the US, and the German Shorthaired Pointer ranks No. 10 on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/most-popular-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's list of most popular breeds\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find German Shorthaired Pointer puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/german-shorthaired-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average German Shorthaired Pointer price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend $800-$2,000 for a pup. For that price, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to German Shorthaired Pointer rescue organizations to adopt or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Or, search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-german-shorthaired-pointer_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",
