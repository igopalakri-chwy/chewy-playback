Canine elbow dysplasia occurs when the elbow doesn’t develop properly and eventually causes pain, lameness and eventually arthritis. Hip dysplasia is when the ball and socket of the joint don’t fit together properly and the joint grinds, which eventually wears the joint down. Treatment may include joint supplements, anti-inflammatory medication or even surgery.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559685&quot;:1117}\"\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;multilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/eye/c_dg_cataract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003ECataracts\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003E: Corgis often develop cataracts, which is when their eyes become cloudy and may eventually lead to blindness.

        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EThe origin of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi dates back to the medieval period, when the kings of Europe showed off their luxurious carpets, textiles and tapestries to demonstrate their wealth. At the time, Flemish weavers were considered the most skilled, and kings often encouraged the weavers to relocate to their kingdoms. In 1107, Henry I of Britain invited a few Flemish weavers to move to southwestern Wales, and the weavers brought the dogs they bred to herd cattle and sheep with them. Those dogs became what we now know as Pembroke Welsh Corgis.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBest known as Queen Elizabeth II's favorite breed, Pembroke Welsh Corgis have risen in popularity as a pet in the United States in recent years and are more popular than their cousin, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/cardigan-welsh-corgi/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECardigan Welsh Corgi\u003C/a\u003E. (Originally considered one breed with two types, the two have been separate breeds since the 1800s.) The American Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke Welsh Corgi in 1934, and the breed is No. 13 on the list of most popular breeds in the AKC.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you looking to add a Pembroke Welsh Corgi to your life?

Depending on the breeder, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi price averages $1,000-$2,000. For that, you usually get a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
