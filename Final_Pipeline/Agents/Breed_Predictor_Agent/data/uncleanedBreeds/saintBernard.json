In general, Saints are not known to bite, but it's always important to properly socialize and train any dog.

When a dog blows their coat, they shed the soft undercoat. This seasonal shedding can last 10-14 days and might be a good time to treat yo' dog and schedule an appointment with a groomer to tackle all that extra fluff professionally.

        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat's the origin of a Saint Bernard? Let's dig into a bit of history. The Saint Bernard is lovingly named after monk Bernard of Menthon, a kind-hearted soul who lived around 1020. Bernard of Menthon established the Great Saint Bernard Hospice for pilgrims traversing the snowy Swiss Alps via the Great Saint Bernard Pass on their way to Rome. In later years, the monks enlisted the dogs to help guard passersby, and the fearless pups are also credited with saving lost travelers in treacherous mountain avalanches and snowdrifts. Saint Bernards have a keen sense of smell and path-finding abilities. The dogs' mild temperament, attentiveness and kindness earned them the nickname \"hospice dogs.\"\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn later years, the Saint Bernard worked on Alpine dairy farms to herd and guard livestock, going by the names Valley Dogs or Farm Dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. Three years later, the \u003Ca href=\"https://saintbernardclub.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESaint Bernard Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was formed, making it one of the oldest specialty clubs still thriving.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFun fact about Saints: It's an often-repeated myth that Saint Bernards used to carry small wooden barrels filled with liquor attached to their collars for avalanche victims to drink and stay warm while waiting to be rescued. Sadly, that never actually happened; and while images of this inaccurate depiction are still alive and well today in movies and cartoons, don't expect your Saint Bernard to play bartender at your next party.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you eager to have a Saint Bernard puppy join your family as a pet? Consider searching the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/saint-bernard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E for reputable breeders.
