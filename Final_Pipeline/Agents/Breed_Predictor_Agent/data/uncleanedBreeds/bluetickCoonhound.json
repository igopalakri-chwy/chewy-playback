Even an extra pound or two can create health problems for your pup, like heart disease. So, mix up rewards with massages or play breaks with a special toy. Chat with your vet if your pup has some extra pounds.

If your dog retches or dry-heaves (with no actual vomit produced), acts restless, has an enlarged abdomen, or lies in a prayer position (front feet down, rear end up), take your pet to an emergency hospital immediately!

The Bluetick's distinct origins go back to Louisiana. They arose from years of crossbreeding by those looking for the perfect hunting companion. Legend has it that the Marquis de Lafayette gave French staghounds to George Washington during the early days of the American Revolution. The French staghounds were then crossbred with English foxhounds to create the elite hunting breed we know today: One with incredible endurance and an acute cold nose—a dog capable of picking up scents that are hours, or even many days, old.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EEarly Southern settlers liked Blueticks for their athletic build, stamina and determination, so they used them for hunting raccoons, as well as in packs of them to track down larger quarries such as wild boar, lynx, bear, and cougar. Blueticks remain highly sought-after companions for pet parents who enjoy the high energy of these wonderfully loyal working dogs.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EToday, Blueticks are iconic companions in old westerns, movies, television shows and cartoons. On the college circuit, the Bluetick Coonhound is the proud mascot of the University of Tennessee. The breed became eligible for American Kennel Club registration in 2009 and has been competing in the Hound group since 2010.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EYou can find a list of reputable Bluetick Coonhound breeders on the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/bluetick-coonhound?breed=44&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003E.
