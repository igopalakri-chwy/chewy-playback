Naturally, they don't have high biting tendencies and aren't known to be a particularly aggressive breed.

After all, Collies are great family dogs. It's literally how they became so famous. Of course, it's not only important to socialize and train all dogs, but pet parents should also teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECollies have a low prey drive and are not typically used as hunting dogs, but they do perform a variety of other jobs. They're popular as service dogs, partly because of their versatility, partly because they retain training so well and also because of their ability to adapt to a variety of living situations and the energy levels of their families.

Follow up with a comb to ensure you've removed all the tangles. Pay particular attention to problem areas: behind the ears and the front legs, under the belly, and the back of the rear legs.

(Collies are great at putting away their toys and \"go get\" or \"find\" things to bring to you, like a purse or pair of shoes.) Collies party hard, but they'll also happily snuggle in for a Netflix binge with you when playtime is over. Ever attuned to their humans, they know you need to recharge before the next adventure!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollies need at least an hour of exercise per day, and, ideally, it is active exercise that you participate in, rather than just turning them loose and alone in a fenced-in yard.

Their kind personalities, herding skills and devotion to family were highly valued. But after Queen Victoria took notice of the breed in the 1860s, it achieved more widespread recognition, and the dogs quickly went from working stiffs to highly prized escorts of the rich and famous.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENot long after that, in the 1870s, the first Collies came to the United States, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.collieclubofamerica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECollie Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was then established in 1886 to help protect and promote the Collie dog breed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the Collie breed's initial burst of popularity had royal roots, it was the 20th-century writings of Albert Payson Terhune (author of \"Lad, a Dog,\" and other books about Collies) and Eric Knight (author of \"Lassie Come Home\") that gave the breed broader recognition as a beloved family companion. The \"Lassie\"\u003Ci\u003E \u003C/i\u003Emovies and television series that followed between the 1940s and 1970s introduced the Collie to an even wider audience.

Each originated in a different region of the United Kingdom and was bred with an emphasis on working ability.
