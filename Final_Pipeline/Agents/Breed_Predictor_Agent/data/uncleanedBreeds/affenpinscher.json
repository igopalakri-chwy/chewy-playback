Pet parents should plan to exercise their Affenpinscher once or twice a day, whether it's a walk, a playful tussle or a fun chase around the house.\n\nDon't forget to exercise their minds as well.

An ideal environment for Affenpinschers is one where they have plenty of companionship from humans who offer consistent, positive reinforcement and guidance.\r\n\r\nBecause they're so active, Affenpinschers would benefit from supervised play with young children. Not only could your Affen's sudden movements scare toddlers, but a tiny tot's sudden movements or rough play may frighten your pup. So, be sure to socialize and train your pup and teach children how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBecause the Affenpinscher is the nosy type, be sure to look at your home from their POV before bringing your new friend home.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Affenpinscher origin story begins in 17th century Germany, when these tiny working dogs were bred to kill mice and rats. But whether by Affenpinscher intelligence or pure cuteness overload, they made their way indoors and into the hearts and homes of their parents.\r\n\r\nAs Affenpinschers joined the ranks of European house pets, various Affenpinscher clubs formed in France and Germany. The American Kennel Club welcomed them as an official breed in 1936, shortly before World War II. The war detracted from the breed's popularity for some time, but Affenpinschers' qualities of cuteness, playfulness and loyalty helped them make a comeback in recent years.\r\n\r\nHere's a fun Affenpinscher fact: In 2013, an Affenpinscher named Banana Joe made breed history by snagging the Best in Show award at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Since then, Affenpinscher popularity has skyrocketed.\r\n\r\nThinking of adding an Affenpinscher to your home? Generally, you can expect an Affenpinscher puppy to cost between $650-$2,000 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues. Check out the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/affenpinscher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E to find a reputable breeder. If you plan to buy an Affenpinscher puppy from a breeder, prepare a list of questions about the dog's health, personality traits and any training (housebreaking, for instance) that has been provided. You can also seek out local Affenpinscher rescues to find a loving dog to adopt or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
