        "h2_faqs": "\u003Ch3\u003EAre Keeshonden hypoallergenic?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nNo, Keeshonden aren't hypoallergenic. The breed sheds heavily (blows their coats) twice annually in the spring and fall. People allergic to dogs would likely be allergic to them, especially when they shed.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Keeshonden bark a lot\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nWhat is a lot? Keeshonden can bark loudly and have a high-pitched bark, but with good training, they needn't be frequent barkers. Their reputation for not loving alone time and developing separation anxiety, where dogs may bark out of fear and anxiousness, has given them a rep for barkiness. It's important to remember that while you can train your pup to know when it's OK to bark, you'll never train the instinct entirely out of the breed.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Keeshonden rare or extinct?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nNo, Keeshonden aren't extinct. They're not a common breed, and many people have never heard of them; however, despite previous threats to their existence, they have survived and thrived.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Keeshonden good family dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nYes. Keeshonden make wonderful family dogs. They are a smart, loyal and playful breed that tends to do well with children and other dogs.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Keeshonden aggressive?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nNo. Keeshonden aren't aggressive. This breed is mild-mannered, typically well-behaved, sensitive and gentle. They are welcoming to visitors and usually have very low aggressive tendencies.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most common Keeshond mixes?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EKeeshond-Husky mix\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EKeeshond-Pomeranian mix\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EKeeshond-Poodle mix\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EKeeshond-Collie mix\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EKeeshond-German Shepherd mix\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
