        "h2_breed_temperament": "If your to-do list is a mile long, and there is nothing you love more than a day spent checking things off it, then you've got a kindred spirit in the Border Terrier. If the Border Terrier had a theme song, it would be Flight of the Bumble Bees—they are busy, busy, busy, love to be on the go, and have a strong work ethic. Their affectionate and happy-go-lucky personality is infectious, though they like their independence—which is what makes them a terrier after all!\r\n\r\nThese medium-height and active little dogs need plenty of engagement and interaction with their humans. A Border Terrier 101 rule is never to let your dog get bored (and maybe you can relate). If they do, they'll put their intelligent brains to use, typically in undesired behaviors. They may think it's entertaining to dig up your lawn or terrorize the local wildlife, but unless you're planning a backyard reno and are thankful to save on some demo costs, \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E may not feel the same.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers are affectionate but aren't overly needy. They love to be involved with what you're doing but aren't as much of a \"Velcro breed\" as some other dogs. These outgoing and confident dogs also enjoy meeting new people, so don't be alarmed if you pick up some new friends while you're out and about.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can live alongside other dogs very happily, especially if their pup pals are playful, too. They can live with cats but will need to be introduced carefully. Border Terriers are an excellent choice for families with older kids, as they're robust and fairly energetic. You might find the kids are great at wearing your dog out as they speed around together.\r\n\r\nWhile this breed was originally a working dog (dogs meant for guarding, pulling sleds or carts or catching vermin), they're more often kept as family pets these days. They still love the opportunity to learn new skills and excel at activities like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.activedogsports.com/what-is-earthdog-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eearthdog\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http://www.flyball.org/aboutflyball.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E and anything else that combines physical and mental work.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "A Border Terriers are a hardy breed that requires low to moderate amount of care, including all the basics like regular grooming, a healthy diet, daily exercise and training. In return, they make affectionate companions.",
        "grooming": "Overall, Border Terriers are low-shedding dogs, and for most of the year, your Border Terrier will only need their coat brushed once a week. A&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/s?query=combo%20dog%20brush&amp;nav-submit-button=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecombo brush\u003C/a\u003E—where one side is a pin brush, and the other side is bristles—is your best bet, as you can use the pin brush side to detangle before smoothing those stray long hairs back into place. \n\nIt's a good idea to get into the habit of checking your dog's nails every time you give them a brush, and you can then clip these as needed, typically about once every two weeks.\n\nDuring shedding seasons, typically spring and fall, however, plan on spending some extra bonding time with your pup for grooming. Border Terriers should be hand stripped—the process of removing dead hairs from the wiry topcoat—every day during shedding season, which can take about 30 minutes. You can also use a&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-blades_c355_f70v83783\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Estripping tool\u003C/a\u003E or book your dog into the groomer for a pamper session.\n\nThe Border Terrier's wiry coat rarely needs bathing, which can strip the oils that help provide the coat's distinctive weatherproof quality. If your dog is particularly active and loves getting dirty, you may need to bathe them more often, but rarely more than once a month.\n\nDental health is essential for your Border Terrier to help prevent gum disease and other health problems. Start \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebrushing your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E twice a week when they're puppies to&nbsp;get them used to the feeling and work up to daily brushings. Bear in mind your pup will still need an annual professional teeth cleaning session from your vet.",
        "training": "Border Terrier training is usually rewarding and fun—these little dogs are enthusiastic and motivated to learn. Typical Border Terrier qualities include an outgoing and playful attitude that makes them keen and quick to learn new commands. Combined with their independent streak, this can make training both endearing and challenging, but consistent, positive reinforcement (aka rewarding good behavior with treats, praise or playtime) will help build confidence in your Border Terrier and help them be their best selves.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers are intelligent and fearless, and socialization as a puppy is an essential part of their training. Border Terriers aren't as biddable as some other breeds, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolden Retrievers\u003C/a\u003E, so it's important to know how to balance their independent-yet-sensitive nature to get the best out of your training sessions.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\nA strong hunting instinct is a fact of life when living with a Border Terrier dog. Some types will have a less pronounced prey drive, but pet parents always need to bear this trait in mind. Few Borders can resist the thrill of the chase when wildlife saunters by, so a securely fenced training area is an absolute must.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Border Terriers typically thrive on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/your-complete-guide-to-the-best-high-quality-dog-food\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E.

They can help you determine the best food combinations to keep your dog as healthy as possible.",
        "exercise": "Border Terriers never sit still for long and need a decent of exercise and activity to keep them content. This playful and intelligent breed adores the physical and mental challenge of high-energy dog sports like searching games, fetch and earthdog. (Earthdog tests a dog's ability to chase and catch critters underground. But no worries; the critters are safely contained and unharmed.) An hour of daily exercise that includes brisk walks and plenty of playtime will help your Border Terrier use up all that bounce.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can live in small homes as long as they spend enough time being active. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/interactive-toys-319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFood puzzles and hide-and-seek toys\u003C/a\u003E are a great way to keep your pup's bright mind occupied at home.

They have an instinct to grab and shake whatever they've \"caught.\" \r\n\r\nWith even the best-trained Border Terrier, it's advisable to keep this dog breed on a leash when you're out and about, as they sometimes can't resist the urge to chase small animals. These little guys are also escape artists, so pet parents need to consider extending fencing underground for at least 18 inches to corral their antics.",
        "ideal_environment": "One of the classic Border Terrier traits is adaptability. That means they can suit a wide range of homes, whether that's a small city apartment or a rural farm. The key is that wherever they live, they still need physical and mental exercise and a well-fenced outdoor area. Border Terriers can be a good choice for new pet parents as long as you're willing to put in the hours needed to keep them entertained and exercised.\r\n\r\nIn terms of other pets, they can live with cats if you introduce them carefully. Even then, you should always supervise Border Terriers when they're with cats they don't know. They're not the best match for homes with small pets like hamsters or gerbils either, as their high prey drive means they will instinctively want to hunt or chase these.\r\n\r\nBorder Terriers can get along great with kids, but because they're so enthusiastic and generally bouncy, be sure to supervise them when younger ones are around.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Border Terriers are generally a healthy breed, with a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years.

        "h2_breed_history": "This plucky little terrier hails from the border between England and Scotland. Their original purpose was to protect herds of sheep (and their lambs) from the local fox population. Because of the Border Terrier's mixed origins, they've had a few different names, including Ullswater Terrier, Reedwater Terrier, and Coquetdale Terrier. These all referenced landmarks around the border country this breed calls home. By the 1800s, the breed became known as the Border Terrier thanks to its link to the Border Hunt based in Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThese brave dogs were famed for their \"hard as nails\" attitude, outgoing personalities and enthusiastic pursuit of their prey. These are traits the modern breed is still famed for today, although these days, the breed is more popular as a family pet than a working dog.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Border Terrier in 1930, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.btcoa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBorder Terrier Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was formed in 1949. However, the breed is still relatively rare in the USA.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering where to find a Border Terrier puppy, then the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/border-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's list of reputable breeders\u003C/a\u003E is the best place to start. In terms of the average Border Terrier price, you should budget around $2,000. For that price, you should get a puppy from a registered and reputable breeder who carries out all the appropriate health and temperament checks. You may also find a Border Terrier at local rescue organizations or animal shelters, so it's always worth contacting those if you're considering rehoming an older Border Terrier dog.

During this time, use a hand stripping or a raking tool daily to remove shedding hair. For the rest of the time, a quick brush once or twice a week will be enough to keep their coat in tip-top condition.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow long do Border Terriers live?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nThe Border Terrier's lifespan is around 12 to 15 years.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EDo Border Terriers bark a lot?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nBorder Terriers don't generally bark a lot. While each puppy is an individual, this breed as a whole isn't considered overly yappy or vocal. If your dog is left alone or bored, then they, like many other breeds, may start barking. The Border Terrier's willing temperament means they can often be trained not to bark excessively.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Border Terriers good pets?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nAbsolutely, Border Terriers are good pets! They will thrive in a home with active pet parents who are committed to providing the level of exercise and enrichment that these playful, smart little dogs need. They can live with cats, but as a terrier breed, they have a naturally high prey drive, which pet parents always need to bear in mind.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most common Border Terrier mixes?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/jack-russell-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EJack Russell\u003C/a\u003E mix (Border Jack)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/chihuahua/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChihuahua\u003C/a\u003E mix (Chi Border Terrier)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/poodle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPoodle\u003C/a\u003E mix (Border Terrier Poodle)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/miniature-schnauzer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESchnauzer\u003C/a\u003E mix (Border Terrier Schnauzer)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPug\u003C/a\u003E mix (Border Pug)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EBorder Terrier-\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/yorkshire-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYorkie\u003C/a\u003E mix (Border Yorkie)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cem\u003ENote: These are not purebred dogs but mixed breeds. \u003C/em\u003E",
