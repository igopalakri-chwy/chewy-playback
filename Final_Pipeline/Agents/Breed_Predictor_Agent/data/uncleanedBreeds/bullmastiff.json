You wouldn't know they were around, except they're usually leaning against your leg or trying to fold themselves into your lap. (Wherever you are is their favorite place to be.) And don't even think of leaving them outside on their own. They'll be at the back door waiting for you to let them in.\r\n\r\nBullmastiffs are not really aggressive, nor are they known for biting (even though they have a powerful bite force). Like most working breeds, they are confident and self-assured, but can be wary of strangers. So, start training your Bullmastiff puppy early to help get them used to having visitors in your home.\r\n\r\nBecause they are large dogs who often think they are toy-sized, they can be a bit clumsy around small children, cats and smaller dogs.

Plan to brush your pup once a week. You'll need to ramp up the brushing to several times a week (maybe even daily) in the spring and fall; they shed more frequently during these times as the weather changes.\n\nWhile you're brushing your pup, take the time to check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling.

Too many baths are not a good thing for your pup; it can strip the natural oils that keep their skin and coat healthy.

These canines are powerfully built and may not always know their strength. You don't want an untrained Bullmastiff running towards visitors and knocking them down.

These dogs are intelligent and quick learners, so they pick up \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Ebasic commands\u003C/a\u003E (like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E) and tricks right away. Because they are such strong dogs, be sure to teach your puppy not to pull on the leash or jump on people during training to prevent mishaps when they're older.\n\n\"Place\" is a great command to teach your Bullmastiff to keep them from bounding toward guests who enter your home. (Place is where you teach your pup to go sit in a certain spot every time, like their crate or bed.) To teach your pup this command, encourage them to go to the spot where you want to them stay (like their bed) by holding a treat over it, saying \"place,\" then giving them the treat and praising when they sit in the spot. Next, let them leave the spot. Repeat this a few times, and move a step or two away from the spot, so you're not standing nearby. (This helps them associate the word \"place\" with that spot.) Gradually, you will be able to be across the room, say \"place,\" and your pup will go right to their spot. You may find it helpful to teach them \"sit\" first.\n\nA Bullmastiff needs firm, consistent training. New pet parents may find attending a group training class helpful. You may even want to hire a trainer who uses positive reinforcement for more one-on-one training. (Positive reinforcement methods use special treats, toys and praise to keep the dog motivated and engaged.)",
        "diet_nutrition": "Your Bullmastiff will benefit from a high-quality and well-balanced diet. Be sure to look on the label for a statement that says the food meets standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Follow the recommended feeding chart on commercial dog food to avoid feeding your dog too much. Your veterinarian can help guide you on how much and how often to feed your Bullmastiff based on their age, health and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nPuppies need specific nutrition for their developing musculoskeletal systems. And puppy food specifically formulated for large dog breeds can be beneficial. Brands that are specifically formulated for large-breed puppies include \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/hills-science-diet-puppy-large-breed/dp/29997\"\u003EHill's\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/purina-pro-plan-puppy-large-breed/dp/52425\"\u003EPurina\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/royal-canin-veterinary-diet-selected/dp/34027\"\u003ERoyal Canin\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nAs you're planning mealtime, don't forget that dog treats count as calories, too! So, you want to find a good balance with meals and treats to keep your dog at an optimal weight. As always, follow your vet's advice. They are in the best position to make mealtime recommendations to meet your pup's optimal nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "Bullmastiffs have moderate energy levels, so they don't need hours of daily exercise (about 30 to 45 minutes is plenty). And if you're dreaming of a running buddy, you may want to consider the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\"\u003ELabrador Retriever\u003C/a\u003E instead. Bullmastiffs are just as happy to go on a walk as they are cozying up on the couch to watch TV. That said, a daily walk and playtime spent in a fenced-in yard are great ways to prevent obesity and boredom and strengthen your bond. Also, these dogs are moderately sensitive to hot weather, so if it's really hot outside, plan your outdoor activities around the cooler parts of the day.",
        "ideal_environment": "Bullmastiffs are ideal for homes with pup parents willing to commit to training. These dogs do well with children and other dogs (not cats), so long as they've been well-trained and socialized from an early age (and as long as children have been taught how to interact with them). Because these dogs are large and powerful, it's a good idea to supervise them when they're around smaller animals and young children.\r\n\r\nThey enjoy larger homes and backyards where there's ample room to roam. However, they can be content in a city apartment as long as there's enough space to move around without bumping into things or people, and they get daily walks outside. Regardless of your home size, be sure to keep things out of reach of their wagging tail; a single swipe can knock stuff down and break things.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Bullmastiffs love to be around their humans. Keep their crate or bed in the room where you spend the most time to keep them feeling part of the action. So, if you're gone often throughout the day, consider enrolling your pup in doggy daycare or arranging for a dog sitter or neighbor to come by and play with your pup.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Bullmastiff origins began in mid-to-late 19th-century England when gamekeepers needed a large working dog with the speed to catch poachers. With the Industrial Revolution in full force, people struggling to put food on their tables turned to poaching game, which came with severe punishment. To apprehend the poachers, gamekeepers needed a quiet, quick dog breed. A cross between the fierce \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bulldog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBulldog\u003C/a\u003E and the large, good-natured \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/mastiff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EMastiff\u003C/a\u003E resulted in the calm yet formidable guard dog we know as the Bullmastiff.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were put to work protecting game at night at the expansive country estates and game preserves of the English aristocracy. There, they would keep an eye out for poachers, then quietly pursue and pin them down until the gamekeepers arrived. To double down on their ninja-like skills, gamekeepers preferred brindle dogs (subtle tiger stripes), so the dog would be perfectly camouflaged at night.\r\n\r\nSoon, gamekeepers began to argue over who had the most-prized Bullmastiff, leading to competitions and exhibitions of the best dogs; quickly, the canine became a popular show dog. Around the same time, the breed became so well-known as a guard dog they were used to guard the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa (around the late 1920s). In 1933, the Bullmastiff was recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Bullmastiff puppies today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/bullmastiff\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average Bullmastiff price? Expect to spend anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 for a pup.
