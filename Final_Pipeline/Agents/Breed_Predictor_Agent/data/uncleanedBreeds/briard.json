They are affectionate, bond deeply with their people and make great family dogs. In fact, Briards get along especially well with kids. Fiercely loyal to their family, the breed sees kids as part of their flock and may devote themselves to their safety and ensuring their needs are met.\r\n\r\nWhile American Kennel Club (AKC) classifies Briards in the Herding group because they were originally bred to herd livestock, Briards don't have a strong prey drive, and they're able to bond well with other animals, too. They will, however, nip at ankles when they want you or children somewhere else. You can help curb this type of behavior with proper training and ensuring they get enough exercise every day.\r\n\r\nBriards love nothing more than having a job to do, whether that's fetching a ball, working through a puzzle or running an agility course. But their most important job (at least in their minds) is guarding their family, and they take their work seriously. That means you'll need to be cautious around strangers. No, Briards won't bite your boss the first time they come over for dinner, but they're certainly not going to offer them a handshake, either. And if you're throwing a dinner party, and your guests have the audacity to mingle in different rooms, don't be surprised if your Briard tries to herd everyone back together.\r\n\r\nBriards are smart dogs who need regular exercise to keep them in top form mentally and physically. Without it, they'll look for other ways to work through their inquisitive, intelligent and high-energy nature, even if that means destructive behaviors like chewing, digging or chasing.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "The sheer, impressive size of a Briard is a great visual reminder of the amount of time and energy that goes into parenting the breed. In this case, \"large dog\" equals \"large amounts of care,\" from daily grooming to a rigorous exercise schedule. But every second you spend on your Briard will be paid back in unwavering devotion (and unchewed shoes).",
        "grooming": "Can you do one more head of hair in the morning? If you're considering bringing a Briard into your life, that's an serious question. Their grooming is more extensive than other breeds, and includes \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/brushing-a-dog\"\u003Edaily brushing\u003C/a\u003E and regular visits with their hairstylist (aka an experienced groomer). Every four to six weeks is recommended to maintain their gorgeous locks.

(Depending on their activity level, you may be able to go longer.) You don't want to give your Briard too many baths; it'll strip the coat of the natural oils that keep it healthy.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDental care:\u003C/strong\u003E After taking care of all that hair, don't forget to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Ebrush their teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily, starting when they are a puppy to get them used to the feeling.

Practicing brushing their hair and teeth and clipping their nails when they're puppies helps them get comfortable with having you up in their business. And that makes the process go a lot more smoothly for you both.",
        "training": "Proper training is the key to a healthy relationship with your Briard puppy. Because they were bred to herd and protect, Briards can quickly become destructive without adequate mental enrichment such as a vigorous game of tag with you or a search-and-rescue mission for their treats. That's bad news for your footwear, furniture and other potential chewables.\n\nBut here's the good news: Their smarts make training them a lot of fun. Briards are phenomenal trick dogs and excel in dog sports, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E competitions. They welcome the opportunity to work their biggest muscle—their brains. Group training or reserving time for them on a herding farm where they can get lots of exercise would be beneficial. As with other dogs, positive reinforcement training (aka offering rewards like treats, toys and praise) is a must when training your Briard, whether they're a puppy or fully grown. Their keen minds will welcome all positive vibes and gifts for a job well done from their cherished pet parents.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003ESocialization\u003C/a\u003E is an important part of your Briard's training. Getting your dog used to new people, other dogs and experiences will help them be OK with social situations as they're older. If you're adopting a puppy, look into puppy schools in your area. These classes get them interacting with other puppies (so they learn how to play nicely with each other), and they are introduced to other pup parents, so they learn people are OK, too.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Briard breed typically does well on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Look for a statement on the packaging that indicates that the food meets the nutritional standards of the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aafco.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAssociation of American Feed Control Officials\u003C/a\u003E (AAFCO), and be sure to choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). Work closely with your veterinarian to determine portion size to decrease the likelihood of obesity. Extra pounds on a Briard can stress joints or cause back pain and increase their likelihood of health problems, like heart disease, or digestive disorders.\r\n\r\nSome Briards can easily pack on the pounds, so food and treat maintenance is key. A good way to keep yourself from over-treating your Briard is to give yourself a treat every time you refuse to let them herd you to the treat cabinet. Positive reinforcement works on humans, too! But if that doesn't work, your vet is in the best position to help you balance mealtime and snack time to help keep your Briard at a healthy weight.",
        "exercise": "Briards have a high energy level, so they need to work, jump, play and otherwise be kept busy. At least one hour a day needs to be devoted to helping them get their daily exercise, and mixing it up keeps both of you from getting bored. One day it might be a romp in the backyard. The next day it could be a run around the park. On the weekend, it could be an agility class, followed the next day with a shift on a working sheep farm. It's all action with these lovable dogs in your life.\r\n\r\nTheir exercise needs to go beyond just the physical, too. These highly intelligent dogs were bred to use their brains. Having \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eproblem-solving games\u003C/a\u003E around the house ready for them to tackle helps keep their mind engaged, supplementing all the exercise you'll be giving their body.",
        "ideal_environment": "The best environment for a Briard is with family. They do well in homes with kids and other pets, especially those with a large, fenced-in backyard with room to run ... and run ... and run some more. Apartment and city living is possible if you're able to provide the exercise and activity they need, but it's not an ideal environment for a Briard. They need space for their voracious appetite for life.\r\n\r\nAn active family who enjoys training and working with their dog in their free time will do well with a Briard, but this dog may not be a social butterfly at the dog park or next brewery opening. Remember: This dog is thinking about their family—and keeping them safe—all. The. Time. In unfamiliar, crowded environments, there can be too many unknowns for a Briard's liking. They prefer to know the intricacies of their surroundings, so they can keep their flock safe.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of their flock, pet parents who have experience with working breeds are a Briard's ideal family. Briards are independent thinkers, and an experienced pet parent understands that patience and consistency are non-negotiables. (There are no days off—ever.) But if a prospective first-time pet parent has their heart set on a Briard, it's highly recommended that they start with an adult Briard who is already socially mature. Often, an adult pup is already well-trained and socialized, so they're used to other people and know how to be a well-behaved member of the family.",

        "h2_breed_history": "Pop quiz! Which of the world's most popular cheeses is the Briard named after? If you guessed Brie, then you're right—well, sort of. (It was a bit of a trick question.) The Briard isn't named after the cheese itself, but they're named after the dairy belt region in northern France known for producing the rich, buttery cheese.\r\n\r\nThis breed has been cherished by the French for centuries. Briards were depicted in tapestries from the 8th century with Emperor Charlemagne. Charles the Great, as he's also called, was also good at bringing things together. He “herded\" western and central Europe together in the Middle Ages. This might be what drew him to the Briard.\r\n\r\nDue to their confidence and athletic and agile nature, these dogs were bred by French farmers for herding and guarding sheep. They eventually used those same skill sets to aid the French army as its official war dog during World War I. They took supplies to the front lines, worked as guard dogs and helped locate wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis popular French breed first came to notice in America when future President Thomas Jefferson was the ambassador to France. When his tenure ended, he left with a pregnant Briard named Bergère. She and her pups worked Jefferson's land and to this day are believed to be some of the first Briard dogs to enter the United States. (Others were brought by his friend, Marquis de Lafayette.) The AKC recognized the breed in 1928 as its 81st breed.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Briard to your family? Briard puppies can be found through reputable breeders listed by the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/briard?breed=58&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC\u003C/a\u003E. The average cost for a puppy is $1,500. But for that price, you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You may also seek out local Briard rescue organizations to find a dog to adopt or search for Briards at your local animal shelter.  You can also search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-briard_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",
