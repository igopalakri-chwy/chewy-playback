If you are interested in this procedure, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian.\u003C/p\u003E",
        "h2_breed_temperament": "Rat Terriers are a big personality in a compact body. Inquisitive and highly intelligent, these qualities work in their favor when it comes to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzles and games\u003C/a\u003E that will provide seemingly endless entertainment.\n\nWhen they're given a job to do, however, things get serious. They give 100 percent whether they're hunting vermin, running agility or having a training session. Because Rat Terrier dogs were bred to both function as a working dog and live with a family, they can master both equally.\n\nThese small-sized dogs are usually very friendly and tend to get along with kids and other dogs, but it's important to remember that all dogs are individuals so this can differ from Rattie to Rattie. As long as your dog is \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eproperly socialized\u003C/a\u003E (aka introduced to different people and environments) from a young age, they'll be a great companion for all the family, and a friend to anyone they meet. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\n\nAs their name implies, these dogs kind of have a thing for vermin. So you may want to rethink a Rat Terrier if you keep house with rats, mice, hamsters or birds unless you take precautions to keep them separated. The same goes for cats, but with early and deliberate introductions as Rat Terrier puppies, the two can definitely thrive together.\n\nRat Terriers are good watchdogs, so don't be surprised if they bark when someone comes to the door. If you feel that it's excessive, there are options to help you \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ereduce your dog's barking\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cb\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\nOverall, Rat Terriers are devoted to their people and they love to be included, so don't leave them alone for too long or they will pine for you. Don't forget that they still operate on instinct—no matter their training, your Rattie might still make the occasional, sudden lunge for a squirrel on your afternoon walk. They're just doing what they were bred to do!",

Remember that training doesn't end when they grow beyond puppyhood. These dogs love to please and need mental stimulation, so don't hold back on graduating them to some fun nose work or performing behavior chains, completing a number of commands before getting that all-important treat or other positive reinforcement.\n\nRewards-based training works best for the Rat Terrier, so prepare to give them plenty of praise and invest in some \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog training treats\u003C/a\u003E (within reason, as you don't want your pooch getting a paunch).

To avoid them causing too much of a racket when the mail arrives, introduce some training to help \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-trick-treat-train-dog-not-bark-doorbell\"\u003Ereduce barking at the doorbell\u003C/a\u003E, especially if it becomes a bit of a nuisance or puts off approaching guests.\n\nWhile this friendly breed is good with kids and other dogs, it's still advisable to spend time \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esocializing your Rat Terrier\u003C/a\u003E while they're a puppy so they become accustomed to meeting new people and dogs, and even cats, who they can (though not always) be trained to live with.",

Be sure to factor in their age and choose the formula based on their stage in life (puppy, adult or senior). While there is no standard feeding chart, your veterinarian can help you determine the best amount of food, and how often your pup should be eating, to meet your dog's unique nutrition needs.\n\nLike many other small dogs, Rat Terriers are prone to obesity and can easily gain weight if they don't get enough exercise or eat too many calories. And yes, treats count as calories!\n\nIt's hard to resist that face when they're begging for more snacks, and of course, treats can be an important part of your little friend's training regimen. Just be careful about overdoing it, because obesity can lead to health issues like heart disease and diabetes. You'll also want to make sure you're feeding your Rattie foods that are safe for dogs and know what \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/toxic-foods-for-pets\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehuman food your dog should never eat\u003C/a\u003E.

But, if you're an active person always on the go, they're more than happy to go with you. If sitting on the couch watching movies sounds fun, better move over to share your popcorn—after you've taken your daily walk, of course.\n\nIf you don't get their daily walk or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-run-with-dog\"\u003Erun\u003C/a\u003E in, these pups can get destructive and turn to chewing shoes or barking when bored.

Bonus points if you can provide lots of mental stimulation during playtime. Hey, letting them tug on a rope while you watch TV counts!\n\nIf you involve them in dog sports, such as agility, they will thrive with this high level of activity and are impressive athletes. Just make sure you're then giving them plenty of rest to recover. They also enjoy \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/dog-swimming-pool-safety-tips\"\u003Esplashing in water\u003C/a\u003E, so think about taking a day trip to the coast or a lake if there isn't a body of water close home.

As with any dog breed, it's best to supervise when your two- and four-legged babies are interacting. It's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\n\nEach Rat Terrier is going to have their own temperament, but they generally can do well living with both cats and other dogs as long as they have been properly socialized from a young age.\n\nRat Terriers also fit right in whether you live in an apartment or wide-open farm land.",

        "h2_breed_history": "Rat Terriers earned their name through history by being experts at catching rats. They originated on American farms, where these little dogs were perfect for exterminating the vermin that could potentially wreak havoc on stored food needed for survival. In fact, they were specifically bred for this very task and in the 1910s and 1920s, they were the most common farm dog in the US.\r\n\r\nThe Rat Terrier dog breed comes from a mix of several different breed types, including the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/smooth-fox-terrier/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESmooth Fox Terrier\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/manchester-terrier/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EManchester Terrier\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/whippet/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EWhippet\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/italian-greyhound/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EItalian Greyhound\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/beagle/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBeagle\u003C/a\u003E. Farmers used different combinations of breeds to land on the traits they required for the job. For instance, Whippets and Italian Greyhounds were included for their speed and the Beagle for their superior hunting skills. An American original, it's said Teddy Roosevelt is responsible for naming this breed.\r\n\r\nAs farmers started killing rats with poison, Rat Terriers became less popular until the 1990s when they started making a comeback. The Rattie was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2006.\r\n\r\nWant a Rat Terrier?

What's the average cost of a Rat Terrier puppy? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend $500-$1,100 for a Rattie pup. Puppies bred through a reputable breeder will have their puppies screened for any concerns medically and behaviorally and may come with pedigree papers.
