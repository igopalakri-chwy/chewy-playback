        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Cane Corso traces its origins back thousands of years to a group of working breeds called Molossers, after an ancient Greek tribe that bred these big, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/mastiff\"\u003EMastiff\u003C/a\u003E-type dogs to be guardians.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the Romans conquered the Greek Islands, they brought these dogs back to Italy, where they produced the ancestors of today’s Cane Corso. The Romans originally used the Cane Corso as \u003Cem\u003Epireferi\u003C/em\u003E—essentially, they were some of the world’s first military service dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the Roman Empire dissolved in the 5th century, this \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/behavior-breeds-8-italian-dog-breeds\"\u003EItalian breed\u003C/a\u003E was used for hunting, herding, and even as guardians for farms. After two world wars, economic downturns, and an end to many family-owned farms, the breed nearly went extinct. \u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, some surviving Cani Corsi were discovered in the 1970s, and a group of Italian dog fanciers set out to revive the breed. By the 1990s, Cani Corsi were making waves at dog shows across Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThey arrived in the U.S. in the late 1980s, and a few years later, the International Cane Corso Association was formed. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking to make one of these pups a part of your family?
