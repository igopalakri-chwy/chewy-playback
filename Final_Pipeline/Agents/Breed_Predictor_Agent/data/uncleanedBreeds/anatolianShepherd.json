This intelligent and \"I-want-to-do-it-my-way\" attitude is why the breed is not ideal for your first dog—strong-willed streaks can be frustrating! They need a confident, calm and patient leader who understands what is needed to bring out the best in this breed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProper socialization is important; without it, the breed isn't generally friendly with outsiders and can be hesitant to interact with people they don't know.

Puppy training school is a good place to start. If you have children or other pets in the house, socialize the puppy with them early and reward positive behavior with treats, praise or other high-value goodies. Pro Tip: You may find that \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/find-a-dog-trainer\"\u003Eenlisting the help of a certified trainer\u003C/a\u003E or pet behaviorist is beneficial.

What do you need to do? Be confident, calm and consistent, and make sure they get the training they need. As you train your pup, use positive reinforcement methods where you reward your dog for good behavior. If you do use a trainer or behaviorist, always be present during the training sessions so you can benefit from the extra bonding with your dog—you want your dog respecting you, not the trainer! When your dog trusts your leadership, they will be happier, better behaved and reach their full potential as a wonderful, loyal Anatolian dog—a true canine superhero!\u003C/p\u003E",

        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Anatolian Shepherd we know and love today comes from the Anatolian region of Turkey. Ancient artifacts show the breed's origin may date back as early as 2000 B.C.—that makes the Anatolian a truly ancient dog breed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModern Anatolians descend from the Coban Kopegi (\"shepherd's dog\") developed by herders to care for their sheep and goats. Unlike the herding dogs who moved the flock from location to location, the Coban Kopegi were bred to protect the flocks from large predators. Those ancient dogs were likely bred from Roman Mollosian war dogs and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/tibetan-mastiff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ETibetan Mastiffs\u003C/a\u003E. They were known for their hardiness, independence and loyalty, traits the Anatolians and other Turkish shepherds of today still possess—like the Turkish Kangal, also known as the Kangal Shepherd Dog.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir reputation as a guard dog led to their inclusion in the \"Sheepdog Project\" that ended with the outbreak of World War II. The program, led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was meant as an experiment to see which breeds would perform best as guardian dogs in the United States. They gained popularity among United States breeders when Lieutenant Robert Ballard, who was stationed in Turkey, brought a breeding pair home with him. Their popularity grew as farmers and ranchers discovered their phenomenal abilities in protecting livestock by keeping wolves and other predators away. The American Kennel Club officially recognized Anatolian Shepherds as an established breed in 1996.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to their amazing qualities, the Anatolian Shepherd and Kangal Shepherd have been selected by the \u003Ca href=\"https://cheetah.org/canada/about-us/what-we-support/livestock-guarding-dogs-program/\"\u003ECheetah Conservation Fund\u003C/a\u003E as guardian dogs for stock in Africa. The dogs are raised and given to farmers in an effort to scare cheetahs away rather than killing them.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EReady to look for your own Anatolian Shepherd puppy? You can find a list of reputable AKC breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/anatolian-shepherd-dog\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. Anatolian Shepherd prices range from $800 to $1,500. But that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
