These powerful dogs tend to be wary and might react to being pushed too hard to do something. If you're not clear about how positive reinforcement works, ask a certified trainer to help you. Sometimes Akitas are so clever that a confident, experienced trainer is a better option if you want to have the most success.",

Choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether your dog's a puppy, adult, or senior.\r\n\r\nYou also want to make sure you don't exercise your Akita too close to mealtime or let your Akita eat too quickly.

They love outdoor adventures and would be thrilled if they went for a long walk with you every day.

But don't leave them alone in your backyard to fulfill their exercise needs. They really just want to be with you.\r\n\r\nAkitas are happiest with daily physical and mental activity, but this doesn't mean they need to play all the time. As long as they can get some exercise, they're content to be at home with you for the rest of their day.",
        "ideal_environment": "Akitas can be perfectly happy living in a large home or a small apartment, as long as they get sufficient exercise. Since they tend to be hesitant around strangers, it's best if they live in a quieter home. If you have a lot of parties or people coming in and out all day, that's not the best environment for having an Akita dog as a pet. But if it's mostly just you and your family, they'll thrive and want to bond with you throughout the day.\r\n\r\nAkitas are loyal to their families, and an Akita raised with cats or socialized as a puppy may do well with a family's small pets and children. However, you'll still want to ensure children are taught how to interact with dogs, as well as supervise all their interactions to ensure everyone stays safe.\r\n\r\nIn general, Akitas thrive best in a home without young children, where they're the only pet and can bask in all your love and attention.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Akita's origin is from 17th century northern Japan when a banished nobleman was seeking to breed a loyal hunting dog. The Akita was bred to have characteristics that helped them hunt deer, boar and even local bears. The breed was close to extinction a few times; today, it's seen as a symbol of health and happiness in Japan.\r\n\r\nHelen Keller brought the first Akita to the United States after she was gifted one while visiting Japan in 1937. Although World War II slowed the breeds' introduction to the United States, some soldiers brought Akitas back with them when they returned home.\r\n\r\nThe Akita was officially recognized by the AKC in 1972 when the breed entered the AKC's Stud Book; they joined the Working group in 1973. (The dogs in this group were all bred to do specific jobs, like hunting or pulling sleds). Currently, there are two main types of Akitas: the more commonly known American Akita (or just Akita) and the Akitainu (meaning \"dog\"), also called the Japanese Akita. The AKC considers these two separate breeds: the Akita and the Japanese Akitainu.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find Akita puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Akita breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/akita?breed=4&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average Akita price can be anywhere from $600 to nearly $2,000 for an Akita puppy, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and any health or temperament screenings performed. An Akita puppy with prize-winning parents might even cost up to $4,000. Akita rescue organizations can also help you find a purebred, or you can check your local shelters for Akitas to adopt. You can also search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-akita_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",
