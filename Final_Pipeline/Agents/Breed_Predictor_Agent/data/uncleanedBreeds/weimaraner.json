So, stay alert!\n\nSpend one day with a Weimaraner, and you'll quickly discover their love for human and animal connection. But thanks to their tall height, lanky stature and fast speed, they can be a bit clumsy around unstable toddlers, the elderly and small pets. So make sure you keep an eye on your Weim when grandma comes for a visit.\n\nWeimaraners will experience \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/reducing-separation-anxiety-dog\"\u003Eseparation anxiety\u003C/a\u003E when you're gone too long.

If an unexpected bite happens, it's most likely from misjudging where your hand will go next, and the dog will often pause to apologize for the mistake.\n\nThis social breed loves to be out and about, from visits to friends' homes to public outdoor spaces. And they adapt quickly and find joy in poking their noses in whatever activity you're doing. Do you have a farm?

This breed thrives on gathering information and putting it to use, making them excellent partners for competitions and social outings.\n\nWeims are eager to learn and need training to harness their exuberance during the puppy years. They respond best to positive-based \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Etraining\u003C/a\u003E that uses praise, petting and treats within a structured course that builds upon techniques learned each session. You might find the assistance of a certified dog trainer or behaviorist especially helpful in these early stages.\n\nWeimaraner training should be consistent, regular and creative. For example, you can teach your dog that when you pull out their leash at night, it means it's time for obedience class, and they'll look forward to the training sesh. They may even remind you about the activity minutes before by waiting by the door or nudging the leash. You (or your trainer) should mix up the format of these training sessions or else your Weimaraner will get bored. Perhaps start some sessions with social time and other times go straight into training. Keep a Weimaraner guessing, and you'll have a focused dog.\n\nIt may be a little difficult for this breed to learn to walk on a loose leash or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome when called\u003C/a\u003E.

If you're selecting a dog from a breeder, ask what brand and formula they were feeding the puppy. You may choose to continue with the same.\n\nYour veterinarian can provide additional nutrition information and help you create a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/how-much-food-to-feed-my-dog\"\u003Efeeding chart\u003C/a\u003E to determine how often and how much to feed your dog based on their specific dietary needs, age, size, activity level and health conditions. Treats are OK for Weimaraners in moderation. However, these quick snacks contain calories and can add up, leading to obesity.\n\nBecause Weimaraners are large-breed dogs, puppies benefit from calcium and glucosamine \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/cat/food-and-nutrition/choosing-the-best-joint-supplements-for-dogs\"\u003Esupplements\u003C/a\u003E to give their bones and joints the best support possible during their growing years.

Not sure if your dog is maintaining a proper weight or consuming the right nutrition? Consult your veterinarian, as they are the best resource to help you pick proper food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Weimaraners are energetic dogs. They crave movement and will enjoy going with you on a trail run, hunting trip, afternoon swim or participating in an agility trial.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, exercise for a puppy should equal about five minutes per month of age, twice a day. So, a Weimaraner puppy who's 4 months old should get 20 minutes of exercise two times a day. This might be in the form of a walk around the neighborhood in the morning and playtime at the dog park after dinner.\n\nAdult Weimaraners more than 1 year old can easily enjoy one to three hours of activity each day thanks to their high energy level. But don't be fooled! This physically active dog will coax you to stay out and about all day if you let them. You may need to remind them that sleep is important, too.\n\nWeimaraners are a working breed who excel at hunting. It's one of their best traits. If that's your weekend pastime, you've met your furry soul mate. To really connect, reward your pet with a tasty protein-rich snack (we recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/american-journey-beef-recipe-grain/dp/177956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Journey Beef treats\u003C/a\u003E) as you teach them how to track and retrieve.\n\nAs you're giving your Weim physical challenges, be sure to challenge their mind, too.

This breed's large size can accidentally knock down tiny tots when playing or running toward you for a treat.\r\n\r\nWeims are great as a pet for experienced pup parents. Their high-energy and quick mind means you'll need to stay one step ahead of them to keep them well-behaved and out of trouble. For the best behavior, get the zoomies and wiggles out with frequent visits to the backyard or local park. Weimaraners tend to love water and lots of land to roam, making them an ideal breed for rural dwellers who have a small pond on their property.\r\n\r\nWhen friends drop by or you host holiday dinners with extended family, a Weimaraner will act as your jubilant door greeter and happily sniff everyone who enters. They may even pick a favorite and try to be a lap dog to get extra close and personal.\r\n\r\nThese dogs get along well with other dogs. When it comes to feline friends, Weimaraners either ignore or chase these furry companions.

The best way to manage this situation is prevention. Keep small children’s toys, dirty laundry and other curiosities off the floor where the dog can get to them. If the dog does eat a foreign object, please take them to your vet immediately. In some cases, the vet can induce vomiting to recover the object. In other cases, the vet may use X-rays and/or an ultrasound to help determine if surgery to remove the object is needed.  \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;335559991&quot;:360}\"\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_dg_hip_dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003EHip\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003E or \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_dg_elbow_dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003EElbow Dysplasia\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003E: Dysplasia occurs when the joints do not form properly and therefore do not fit together well.

        "h2_breed_history": "The origin of Weimaraners takes us to early 19th century Germany. The Grand Duke of Weimar (the breed's namesake city) expressed the desire for a dog who was bold, fearless, intelligent and an excellent hunting companion with a strong prey drive. The sportsman had several breeds crossed (possibly Bloodhound with German and French hunting dogs) to create the Weimaraner breed.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Weimaraners were bred for sport and to minimize predator problems. These dogs use their acute senses to detect and point at their prey, leading their human hunting companion in the right direction. In Europe, the hunting dogs were used to flush out wolves, bears and mountain lions that were harming livestock. Big game hunters also prized the breed for their skills.\r\n\r\nThe dog started showing up in America in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized Weimaraners in 1943. Weimeraner fans include President Eisenhower and Grace Kelly.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to add a Weimaraner puppy to your family?
