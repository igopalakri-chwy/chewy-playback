A German Pinscher puppy needs a confident and calm leader who understands the consistency and patience needed to work with willful breeds, which is why they're better suited for people with previous dog experience.\n\nThese dogs were bred to hunt vermin, so it's important to always keep them on a leash when not in an enclosed area, like a fenced yard. No matter how well you train your German Pinscher, if they decide something needs chasing\u003Cem\u003E right now\u003C/em\u003E, they'll be off on the hunt—and they won't look both ways before crossing the street.

This means you'll need to take your German Pinscher puppy out on walks and let them experience new people, pets and situations. Start while they're young, and they'll grow up thinking it's normal to be around new people (and understanding there's no need to defend you). Puppy preschool is a great place to help with socialization skills. Here, puppies learn to play nicely with each other, and they get to meet new (and not \"dangerous\") people all in one setting.",

Look for a statement on the packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nBe sure to include the treats you give during all those training sessions (and just because they're adorable) in your overall mealtime plan, too. Even an extra pound or two can create health issues, like heart disease and diabetes, for your pup later in life. If you notice your dog's getting a little thick around the middle, talk with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together an exercise and meal strategy to help your pup lose the weight and maintain their nutritional needs.",

This on-the-go breed was born to run and hunt—two traits that demand high energy—and you'll need to burn through all that energy on the daily.\n\nThese dogs are super smart and super athletic, so find different activities that play to both of those strengths. If you're looking for a running partner, your German Pinscher dog is a great reason to get out of bed (early!) in the morning. A few walks during the day are good, too, but always make sure they are on a leash when outside a fenced yard. Teaching your pup fun tricks, like play dead or shake, can be a great way to keep their brain engaged, as well as to bond with your bestie.\n\nIf you're competitive, consider getting your German Pinscher involved dog sports like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, obedience, rally (similar to obedience) and tracking competitions. These activities work both the mind and the body, and as an added bonus, you'll get to show off your dog to a whole new audience.\n\nDon't forget to engage their brains when they're inside the house, too. Leave a few \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E around for them to solve (and dish out a yummy treat when they've solved it!).",

If you're looking for a dog who wakes up and thinks about their next nap, the German Pinscher is not the right choice for you.\r\n\r\nGerman Pinschers prefer tranquil settings over a lot of raucous activity. When properly socialized, they can do well with older kids who won't alarm them with random squeals. They can get along with other dogs, too, and possibly cats they've known since they were a puppy. But small pets, like rabbits, are no dice. These working dogs were bred to hunt, and these types of pets are guaranteed to fire up their their hunting and chasing instincts.\r\n\r\nThey do well in homes of any size—apartments to homes with a fenced yard—as long as you're able to give them the daily exercise they need.

It was a foundation breed for the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDoberman Pinscher\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/miniature-pinscher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EMiniature Pinscher\u003C/a\u003E, and in 1885, the dog was first listed in German records as a smooth-coated Pinscher. Originally, there were two types in the breed: smooth-coated and wire-coated. In the 1900s, the two types were split into two breeds: German Pinscher and Standard Schnauzer.\r\n\r\nThe German Pinscher dog almost went extinct after both World War I and World War II, with no litters registered in West Germany from 1949 to 1958. But Werner Jung, a breed enthusiast in Germany, saved the day—and the breed—when he smuggled a female out of East Germany and bred her with several Miniature Pinschers.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, German Pinschers began to show up in the United States and were bred in small numbers. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2003.\r\n\r\nDo you want to add a German Pinscher to your family? You can find a reputable breeder at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/german-pinscher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E; a puppy can cost $650-$1,000, with some as much as $2,500. For that price, you're likely getting a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also contact German Pinscher rescues to adopt a pup or keep an eye out for the breed at a local rescue.
