Sometimes they'll respond more to a fun game with their pet parent (like a game of tug-of-war) than they will to a treat.

Bikejoring is dog-powered mountain biking, where one or two dogs pull in front of a bike (like sledding, but without the snow—and with wheels). This can be an individual sport with timed trials or an off-road competition. Your AmStaff will need to get used to a harness designed for the sport, and you'll also need a special attachment for your bike. Talk to your veterinarian to make sure your dog is socialized and healthy enough to enjoy the sport.\r\n\r\nThey may also enjoy many other sports as forms of daily exercise, including agility sports.",

They may do OK in apartments as long as they're able to get in plenty of exercise every day.\r\n\r\nRemember, these are strong and smart dogs, so they may not be ideal for first-time pup parents. They need someone who understands the unique qualities of this breed and is confident they can bring out the best in this pup.\r\n\r\nAmStaffs are often affected by breed-specific legislation that is designed to reduce the number of dog attacks in communities by certain dog breeds, so check with your city ordinances or home owner's association regulations to make sure you're following the set guidelines before bringing your pup home.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The American Staffordshire Terrier is one of several dog breeds with a darker origin. They were bred as fighting and baiting dogs in the 18th and 19th centuries. The AmStaff's exact genetic lineage is debated, but most agree that the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bulldog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBulldog\u003C/a\u003E from 200 years ago makes up part of their genetic history. Others believe that the extinct White English Terrier and Black and Tan Terrier were also part of the AmStaff's bloodline. Whichever specific breeds were used, for a time, the dogs were used mostly for dogfighting in the UK, even after the blood sport was outlawed.\r\n\r\nThe breed arrived in the United States in the mid-1800s. Some say that once in the US, they were used mostly for farming and hunting rather than fighting. Over time, they were bred to be taller, larger dogs and were first registered with the American Kennel Club in 1936 as the Staffordshire Terrier. In 1972, the AKC recognized two distinct breeds: the American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Today's AmStaff is much friendlier and calmer than their 18th-century fighting ancestor.\r\n\r\nFun fact: Some people mistake American Staffies for American Pit Bull Terriers, but they're not the same dog. The AKC recognizes the American Staffordshire Terrier, but not the American Pit Bull Terrier (but the breed is recognized by the United Kennel Club). Generally, AmStaffs are less bulky, although similar in strength. Now, this is where it may get confusing: The term \"pitbull\" is also a generic term for all bully breeds, including the AmStaff. (Bully breeds are all the dogs who share a common, extinct ancestor called the Molossus.)\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find an American Staffordshire Terrier puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/american-staffordshire-terrier?breed=13&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average American Staffy price can be anywhere from $250-$2,000 for a puppy, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. Puppies with the most impressive pedigrees might even cost $10,000 or more. You can also find a purebred to adopt with the help of American Staffordshire Terrier rescue organizations and local shelters.
