The Giant Schnauzer size—and big bark to match!—might make them intimidating to strangers. But with family? They are wonderfully engaged, friendly dogs who want nothing more than to be with their pet parent.\r\n\r\nThey're highly intelligent—Giant Schnauzer puppies can be downright mischievous!—and if socialization and exercise needs aren't met, they'll make it their job to create a job for themselves that may be difficult to undo. Digging holes and destroying furniture or slippers are not unheard of! For this reason, make sure you give them a job to do that you actually approve of, like fetching your slippers or the morning paper.\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzer dogs can be good with older kids once they're properly trained and socialized, but these big dogs don't make the best of companions for small children that can easily (though accidentally!) be knocked over. Giant Schnauzers can also be trained to live happily with other furry family members, but make sure they're of the barking variety—best to steer clear of the meowing kind.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Giant Schnauzers need a higher level of exercise than most dogs. The same goes for mental stimulation, as well as the cost of extensive regular grooming (trimming, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebaths\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Eteeth cleaning\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/trimming-your-puppys-nails\"\u003Enail trimming\u003C/a\u003E). The most distinctive Giant Schnauzer traits are their beard and brows—which give them a look of nobility—but they'll both need to be cleaned after every meal to catch drool and debris that naturally accumulate. But they'll repay your attentions with lots of love!",
        "grooming": "When it comes to grooming, Giant Schnauzers will need to be bathed within a four-to-six-week range to ensure their wiry coat is kept at its best. Their nails should be trimmed weekly—at a minimum. And after a day of your speedy Schnauzer running around, you'll need to pay mind to brush them thoroughly, especially their iconic beard and brows—it can get muddy out there!\r\n\r\nBrush your Giant Schnauzer's coat carefully with a large \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E with large bristles. Their long beards and mustaches will probably need to be washed or at least combed through with a small metal comb after most meals. Giant Schnauzers don't shed much, but daily brushing to remove outside debris or food is necessary.\r\n\r\nTeeth brushing should be done every day with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/toothpastes-2598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etoothpaste made specifically for dogs\u003C/a\u003E. Your vet can teach you how to brush; start when your Giant Schnauzer is a puppy so they get used to the routine. Otherwise, your nobleman will be at risk for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/mouth/periodontal-disease-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Egum disease\u003C/a\u003E and other dental problems. And as with all dog breeds, annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not your groomer) is mandatory.",

They'll be the star of the show at puppy school for sure!\n\nGiant Schnauzer training doesn't have to be obedience-based but it needs to be consistent. Giant Schnauzers need a job to do, and without one, they don't make a good first-time pet. As their pet parent, you need to find their motivations (praise, rewards or play) and dedicate training time every day—a combination of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E with agility courses or a high-energy exercise like hiking—for best results.",

Novice owners may be tempted to offer larger food portions because their pup has been working hard, but it's better to stick with a higher-protein diet and avoid a raw diet altogether.\r\n\r\nObesity can be a significant health problem in Giant Schnauzers. It may be hard to turn down their loving face and soulful eyes but resist the temptation to show your love with leftover people food or loads of doggie treats. Instead, give them a hug, brush their fur or teeth, play a game with them or perhaps take them for a walk. They want your attention and choosing activity over food will keep them at a healthy weight.\r\n\r\nConsult with your veterinarian to determine what brand of food, how much and how often your Giant Schnauzer should be fed.",
        "exercise": "Giant Schnauzers have energy to spare and need a higher level of exercise than most dogs. And they require a purpose or they'll create their own!\r\n\r\nPet parents who enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, running and swimming will find their furry friend is a worthy companion who can keep up with the best of them. Take your Giant Schnauzer on a daily 30 -to 45-minute walk to stimulate their mind with sights, sounds and smells. Or go the distance (literally!) and build a backyard course that has tunnels, jumps, A-frames and see-saws, and watch your Giant Schnauzer thrive!",
        "ideal_environment": "A working dog like the Giant Schnauzer is best paired with an active pet parent who's craving a buddy for a regularly scheduled 5 am run or hike. A family with older children who all like to have a dog by their side at all times is also ideal.\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzers are in their element when living in a medium-to-large size home in the suburbs, a large house in the country or on a farm. They're no couch potatoes, but then again, neither are you!\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzers can be rambunctious and unaware of their own strength, and their size can be imposing to smaller dogs or pets. Giant Schnauzers may exhibit their innate herding tendencies naturally (if not given a more appropriate outlet for it) with multi-pet households; socialize them sooner rather than later with a puppy playgroup or training class to ensure they \"play well with others.\"",

When a dog bloats, the stomach twists on itself and fills with gas. Left untreated, the condition is quickly fatal. If your dog retches or dry-heaves, acts restless, has an enlarged abdomen or lies in a prayer position (front feet down, rear end up) take your pet to an emergency hospital immediately!

        "h2_breed_history": "The Giant Schnauzer dog is the largest of the three Schnauzer breeds (Miniature and Standard being the other two). The Giant Schnauzer breed's origin dates back to 17th century Germany to the \"bear Schnauzer\" of Munich, a long shaggy-haired dog related to the Old German shaggy shepherd dog primarily tasked with cattle herding.\r\n\r\nThe Giant Schnauzer breed is a cross between the \"bear Schnauzer\" and black \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/great-dane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGreat Dane\u003C/a\u003E, which accounts for their shorter hair and larger body, creating an elite working dog who can also serve as a family guard dog.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Belgian \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bouvier-des-flandres/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBouvier des Flandres\u003C/a\u003E, Giant Schnauzers were originally bred to drive cattle from farm to market. The breed gained popularity after World War I and, since then, Giant Schnauzers have been trained to serve as police dogs, military dogs and search and rescue dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Giant Schnauzer gained American Kennel Club breed recognition in 1930, and the breed is a frequent competitor in the dog sports/competitions circuit. In modern times, the Giant is still bred throughout Europe as a companion and useful working dog rather than as a \"fancy\" breed.\r\n\r\nAre you considering a Giant Schnauzer as a pet? The cost for a Giant Schnauzer puppy ranges from $1,000 to $1,500 for a purebred. For that price, you're likely to get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
