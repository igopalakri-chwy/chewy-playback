Remember that each dog is an individual. Some Shelties will be very tolerant and almost never nip at anyone. They do also have a tendency to sound the bark alarm to alert their family to anything that may be amiss, whether that's an approaching stranger to the door or a rogue truck rolling down the street.\r\n\r\nShelties love to play and are quite intelligent, and the more time they have to burn off their high energy levels, the better.

You'll want to pay particular attention to mats behind the ears, under their legs or on the back of your Sheltie's legs. A professional groomer can help you determine how to best keep your Shetland Sheepdog puppy mat-free all the way through adulthood. Like many longer-haired dogs, Shelties have seasonal \"coat blowing\" that occurs when the weather transitions from warmer or cooler or vice versa. When a dog blows their coat, they shed it in chunks of fur instead of a lot of little hairs. Your Sheltie will need brushing more than once a day during this time, since they'll shed more than normal for a few weeks.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBathing:\u003C/strong\u003E As for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebathing\u003C/a\u003E, this is one area where you'll get a break on grooming.

Keep the training sessions short, so you aren't trying to force your Sheltie to do something they're not interested in. If you need any help, look for a certified trainer who specializes in positive reinforcement and ask them for advice.\n\nThese dogs can thrive at many jobs, from herding to being a therapy dog or more active \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E training.

Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\r\n\r\nSince they are smaller in size, it's important to keep your Sheltie at a healthy weight and not overfeed them, which helps prevent health issues like hip dysplasia, which can occur in this breed. When determining how much to feed your dog every day, don't forget to calculate the calories in treats or extra kibble that you might use while training them. Interactive food toys can also be something Shelties really enjoy and help engage their brains as they eat.\r\n\r\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian, as they will be in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Shetland Sheepdogs are active dogs with a high energy level. They don't need to be on-the-go all the time, but they do need outlets multiple times a day to get all their beans out, and need about an hour of daily exercise. They'll love running around in a yard or in the countryside, but if your Sheltie is a city dog, then make sure you take them on walks or jogs regularly that last 30-60 minutes each day.\r\n\r\nShelties absolutely love herdingâ€”it's what they were bred to do! Since most pet parents don't have a flock of sheep around, consider signing your Sheltie up for dog sports, like herding or agility courses. This is a great way to meet your Sheltie's exercise needs and can provide an opportunity to lean into your dog's natural speed, intelligence and energy.",
        "ideal_environment": "Shetland Sheepdogs will love running around in the countryside or playing in a home's large yard. These affectionate dogs do tend to bark a lot, so you might not want one in an apartment with paper-thin walls. They can be trained to curb that natural instinct, but they won't stop barking completely. But as long as they get about an hour of exercise a day, they can be happy with city life too. They are a great match for both first-time pet parents and more experienced pet parents.\r\n\r\nThese dogs love their family and are happy to relax at home after a day of play. Shelties can be a little shy, however, so if yours is the party house, they probably won't be making the rounds and catching up with Susie from three streets over.\r\n\r\nShelties are great in multi-pet householdsâ€”they get along well with other dogs, and since they don't have a strong prey drive, they can make a great companion for cats. They also are well-suited for families with young children, since they tolerate kids in their family well. However, you should still watch them closely around kids they don't know and make sure that children don't play too roughly with them, and that everyone respects each others' boundaries.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Shetland Sheepdog's origins date back to the Shetland Islands in the United Kingdom, where the breed was used as agile herding dogs to move sheep, poultry and ponies. Shelties were bred for a smaller size so they would eat less in a food-scarce, cold environment. Their history also included serving as a companion who warned their family of intruders.\r\n\r\nExperts debate about whether or not Shelties are actually directly related to Rough Collies. Some think the Collie is just one of many breeds blended to create the Sheltie, which may account for why some Shetland Sheepdogs in the same litter can be such different sizes, weights and heights. However, others believe that Shelties are not directly descended from \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/collie/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECollies\u003C/a\u003E at all, but both share a common ancestor in the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/border-collie/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBorder Collie\u003C/a\u003E. Some believe the dog's lineage includes a Northern Spitz from Scandinavia, a King Charles Spaniel, an original Pomeranian, a Scotch Collie and other indigenous island dogs. However, the breed's complete lineage is not known and still a subject of debate.\r\n\r\nShelties were first recognized by the Kennel Club in England as the \"Shetland Collie\" in 1909, and the name was later changed that same year to Shetland Sheepdog. The first Shetland Sheepdog was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1911, after being imported from Shetland.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find a Shetland Sheepdog puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/shetland-sheepdog?breed=229&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. The average Shetland Sheepdog puppy price can be $850-$2,000, with some even costing $6,000 or more, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. You can also find a purebred to adopt with the help of Shetland Sheepdog shelters or rescue groups.
