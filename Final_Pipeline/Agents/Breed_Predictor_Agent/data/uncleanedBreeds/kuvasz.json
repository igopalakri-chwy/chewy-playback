        "h2_breed_temperament": "Though they look like big, fluffy teddy bears, the Kuvasz has a robust personality and guarding instinct that makes them a force to be reckoned with. As working dogs, they were bred to guard livestock; today, they may be suspicious of strangers. When confronted with strangers on their property, or if they just have a sense that something's not quite right, they can be very vocal barkers and, without proper training and socialization, may be reactive in these situations. However, with proper socialization and training, they can learn the difference between friend and foe.\r\n\r\nKuvaszok are extremely smart. How smart? They've been known to figure out how to open doors and gates to free not only themselves, but other animals, too. (The ones they like, that is!) They do well with animals they know and like if they're properly socialized starting in puppyhood.\r\n\r\nKuvaszok do well with kids they know (and who know how to play nicely with dogs), but you always should supervise playtimes. They are large dogs who may accidentally knock children over.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Kuvaszok are fairly independent, but they can't take care of themselves! Their double coats and independent streak means you'll be spending a fair amount of time on their upkeep (translation: you'll be brushing, training and exercising these pups a lot every day).",
        "grooming": "The Kuvasz sheds a lot (pretty much 24/7), but they typically don't require professional grooming, as their needs can easily be handled by their pet parents.\n\nThe Kuvasz sheds the most during the spring and fall, as they have a very heavy double coat. The silver lining, though, is that they have little-to-no dog odor. Plan on brushing your pup at least once a week. Use a \u003Ca\u003Emetal pin brush\u003C/a\u003E, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E and a \u003Ca\u003Erake\u003C/a\u003E to remove any tangles, give the coat a healthy shine and remove the dead hair. Because Kuvaszok have such thick coats, it's a good idea to trim the fur around their eyes and toes. (So they can see and get a good grip when they're walking and running.)\n\nYou'll also need to do another type of brushing regularly: toothbrushing. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBrush your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily. It's best to start when they're a puppy, so they'll get used to it faster. Brushing their teeth prevents tooth loss and health problems down the road. And be sure your Kuvasz has an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet.\n\nTheir nails will need a trim once a month, if they're not worn down from all their activity. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear that familiar clacking on your tile floors. (Get step-by-step instructions on how to cut a dog's nails \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.)\n\nWhat about \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebaths\u003C/a\u003E? Rejoice! Your Kuvasz will only need a bath once every three months, unless they've been especially active and need one more frequently.",
        "training": "The Kuvasz is a large-breed dog who is independent and intelligent. This combination will make training a challenge for first-time pet parents; they need a confident, calm and patient leader who understands dogs with this combo of smarts and self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\nLike all dogs, a Kuvasz puppy responds well to positive reinforcement. So, focus on the things they do well and redirect their efforts when they do something you don't want. These dogs don't like a lot of repetition, so keep the sessions short (10 to 15 minutes) and take a break before either of you gets frustrated. Remember to reward their successes with treats, praise and playtime with special toys.\r\n\r\nBecause these dogs can be wary of strangers, start socializing your Kuvasz puppy early. Take them on walks and let them get to know new people, dogs and situations in a calm and positive manner. This will help them to be more comfortable in new settings as they get older. Consider attending puppy school; it's the perfect place for your puppy to learn how to play nicely with other dogs, and they get to mingle with other people. Kuvaszok hit their adolescent phase around 9 months and you might see more undesirable behaviors than usual at that age. It's important you remain patient and calm and be vigilant during this time—and remember you'll both work through it.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Kuvasz typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Consider feeding your Kuvasz puppy a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puppy-11097\"\u003Elarge-breed puppy food\u003C/a\u003E. This type of food can help prevent orthopedic issues that can occur with fast-growing puppy bones. And consult with your vet if you have any questions. They can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nEven though these pups are high-energy dogs, they don't necessarily need to eat massive amounts of food. Putting on just a few extra pounds can cause orthopedic problems like hip dysplasia. And don't forget to include treats in your weekly menu—these calories count, too. If your pup needs help losing weight, consult with your vet. They are in the best position to help you put together a plan to help your pup shed the weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "The Kuvasz has high energy levels and needs quite a bit of activity (about an hour a day). They are happy to exercise themselves in a big, fenced-in yard (that independent streak again!). You may find they're able to provide themselves plenty of exercise if they're able to roam a large area—like an acreage—on their own.\r\n\r\nThese dogs also will enjoy walking with you. However, they were not meant to be walked on leashes in the city (how boring!). They love being active and exploring the outdoors by taking long walks or jogs in the country. An adult Kuvasz is a great hiking companion and is strong enough to carry their own packs. Although they're not as fond of splashing around in the water, like, say, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/boykin-spaniel/\"\u003EBoykin Spaniel\u003C/a\u003E is, the Kuvasz can enjoy it and, if introduced to it at a young age, may enjoy it because it's a great way to cool off.",
        "ideal_environment": "The Kuvasz dog breed thrives in the country and on farms or in suburban areas with fenced yards where they have plenty of room to exercise. They're a good fit for active and experienced pet parents, although newbies who understand this independent dog's unique needs and are dedicated to making training a positive and lifelong experience may do well with this pup.\r\n\r\nThe Kuvasz dog is generally good with kids, as long as they're well socialized. All kids in your dog's life should be taught how to respectfully play with dogs. Kuvaszok should be supervised around other pets—especially if they didn't grow up with them. And they may be wary around strangers and might try to protect you if they sense something's amiss. When they know your friends well, they're more easy-going and accepting. Remember that proper and early socialization goes a long way to helping these pups be well-adjusted members of the family.",
        "h2_breed_health": "Kuvaszok have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years and are generally a very healthy breed. It’s important for potential pup parents to be aware of conditions they may face, so they can help their pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/signs-and-symptoms-bloat-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBloat\u003C/a\u003E/\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/gastric-dilatation-volvulus-gdv-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGastric-Dilatation Volvulus\u003C/a\u003E (GDV)\u003C/strong\u003E: Like many large or giant dogs, Kuvaszok can be prone to bloat, which happens when the stomach fills with air and twists on itself.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Kuvasz has been quite the jet-setter over the centuries, making their way from Tibet, where they're believed to have originated, to Turkey, where they got their name. Next, the Kuvasz traveled to Hungary, where they were originally bred and known for their stellar ability to guard livestock. The breed won high praise from nobility for their loyalty. King Matthias, who ruled Hungary in the 15th century, was actually said to trust his Kuvasz pack more than the people around him.\r\n\r\nThe Kuvasz first came to the US in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club recognized the dog in 1931. Sadly, during World War II, the Kuvasz population in Hungary dropped dramatically, but breeders eventually brought the breed back from the brink.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Kuvasz puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/kuvasz\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's\u003C/a\u003E website. What's the average price for a Kuvasz? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,300 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for temperament and health issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to local Kuvasz rescue organizations to adopt one or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
