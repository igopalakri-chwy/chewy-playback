You'd be hard-pressed to find an Irish Setter who's shy and withdrawn or one who's aggressive and hostile. This breed is happy-go-lucky, ready to romp with your kids in the backyard or keep you company in the house. The Irish Setter wants to be by your side at all times. Their gentle, loving and playful personality makes them a great fit for families. Because of these traits, they're also wonderful therapy dogs who can brighten up a hospital room or nursing home.\r\n\r\nIrish Setters love children, and their goofy nature will keep your kids entertained. These fiery redheads are also very comfortable with strangers (hello, life of the party!) and good with other pets, especially other dogs or cats. Just be careful with pet birds—since Irish Setters were bred to hunt birds, their prey drive might get them in trouble.\r\n\r\nAffectionate, playful and devoted are some of their main characteristics. But Irish Setter dogs also have a mischievous streak: they're fun-loving and curious, and definitely not above getting into a little trouble. The breed is slow to mature, meaning their playful puppy personality stays around a little longer than most dogs. At the end of the day, though, an Irish Setter's temperament is sweet and loving—and their desire to please their pup parent is one of the best qualities Irish Setters possess.",

Between grooming them multiple times a week, wearing them out with walks and games and providing enough mental stimulation to keep them out of trouble, an Irish Setter will definitely keep you busy. Here's your 101 guide to caring for your Irish Setter dog.",
        "grooming": "Irish Setters are a long-haired breed with a beautiful, thick coat of fur. This coat adds extra responsibility for you as their pet parent to keep your pup looking nice. (But trust us, they're worth it.) Brush your Irish Setter every two to three days so their coat won't get tangled or matted. A long \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-pin-brushes_c356_f70v83789\"\u003Epin brush\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/bass-brushes-shine-condition-soft/dp/237366\"\u003Esoft bristle brush\u003C/a\u003E will do the trick, with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-combs_c355_f70v83785\"\u003Efine-tooth comb\u003C/a\u003E for your Irish Setter's tail. When it comes to shedding, you can expect moderate shedding during certain seasons of the year (more in the spring and fall).\n\nCheck your dog's ears regularly for redness, swelling and debris. If you find anything unusual, call your vet—they may advise you to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean your dog's ears\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nYou'll also need to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Etrim your Irish Setter's nails\u003C/a\u003E every couple of weeks.

This will help prevent gum disease and tooth decay. Your vet should also clean your dog's teeth once a year. Grooming your Irish Setter takes some time, but it's all worth it to keep your dog looking beautiful and feeling healthy.",
        "training": "An Irish Setter's intelligence is high. Their desire to please you makes them easy to train and able to learn virtually any command. (Yep, beauty \u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E brains!) However, Irish Setters are prone to getting bored or distracted, which can lead to frustration for pet parents trying to get a training session complete.\n\nKeep in mind that Irish Setters are very sensitive, so yelling is not the way to get your point across—you'll only hurt their loving little hearts. Be patient and gentle as you work with your dog, guiding them to focus and using positive reinforcement (like giving them treats, attention or playtime as a reward). Irish Setters can also be strong-willed, which may stand in the way of a successful training session. Make sure to give them lots of outlets for their energy so they'll stay calm and focused during training.\n\nIrish Setters sometimes have \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/reducing-separation-anxiety-dog\"\u003Eseparation anxiety\u003C/a\u003E because they bond so closely with their families. (We did tell you that they'll want to be with you all the time!) Practicing separation is an important part of training your pup. Get your dog used to being home alone or simply being in a different room of the house from you by practicing in short increments and slowly building up the time.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Feed your Irish Setter dog a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E made for dogs of their age (puppy, adult or senior). Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet, but two to three cups of food each day—split into two servings—is generally recommended.\n\nIf your Irish Setter is highly active, they will require a diet for active sporting dogs to make sure they're getting in \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/3-types-of-dogs-who-could-benefit-from-a-high-protein-dog-food\"\u003Eenough protein\u003C/a\u003E to help their muscles recover. It's also important to make sure your dog always has access to fresh, clean water, especially during the hot summer months.\n\nDon't give your Irish Setter food from the table. Many \"people foods\" are harmful or even poisonous to dogs. The occasional dog treat is OK, but don't overdo it—those calories count, too! If your pup has gained a little extra weight, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you pick the right ratio of mealtimes, snacks and exercise to help your pup shed the extra weight and maintain their optimal nutrition.",
        "exercise": "An Irish Setter's exercise needs are high—this breed has a lot of energy! Your pup will need one to two hours of exercise each day. Daily walks or jogs are a great way to fulfill your dog's exercise needs and cater to that Irish Setter speed. This breed should also be allowed to run off-leash whenever possible—your fenced yard will do the trick. Energetic games such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/discs-2330\"\u003EFrisbee\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E and other dog sports will make your Irish Setter as happy as a clam. If you have access to water, you can take your pup for a swim—Irish Setters are strong swimmers and love the water.\n\nIt's important to provide your dog with ample exercise to help them stay healthy. But for Irish Setters, simple physical activity isn't enough. Irish Setters are very intelligent and love to learn, meaning that mental stimulation is equally important to keep them happy.\n\nObedience competitions, tracking (detecting and following a specific scent) and agility (going through an obstacle course) can all be a good fit for an Irish Setter's energy level and keep them from getting bored, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-tips-how-to-stop-destructive-chewing-in-dogs\"\u003Echewing on things\u003C/a\u003E and barking excessively. You can even create puzzles at home, setting up scavenger hunts where your dog has to find their toys and food or doing scent work to find different scents in your home.",
        "ideal_environment": "Irish Setters can experience separation anxiety and boredom, which can lead them to be destructive—say goodbye to your favorite pair of kicks! An Irish Setter probably won't thrive in a home where their pet parents are gone all day, every day. Besides your company, these pups also need someone who can provide them with plenty of exercise. If these active dogs don't get the exercise and stimulation they need, they might choose their own adventure—and as mentioned above, chances are you won't be a fan of what they pick.\r\n\r\nIf you're considering an Irish Setter, you'll want to be prepared for their grooming needs. This breed has a thick, beautiful coat of fur, but those luscious red locks require a lot of maintenance and upkeep. Between brushing, combing and trimming, you'll stay so busy taking care of your pup's coat that you may not get the time to care for your own locks.\r\n\r\nIrish Setters are excellent family dogs and do very well with children (although older children may be best because of this breed's high energy level). Setters are also good with cats and other dogs. (Just keep them away from birds!) Ideally, they'll live in a home that has a large outdoor space for them to run off-leash. An apartment, townhome or any home in a city would not be ideal for an Irish Setter, but with regular access to a fenced, dog-friendly park, you could make it work.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Irish Setter's origin is fairly straightforward. The Irish Setter breed was first developed in Ireland in the early 1800s as a hunting dog to aid bird hunters in finding and retrieving prey. Hunters combined \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/gordon-setter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGordon Setters\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/english-setter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEnglish Setters\u003C/a\u003E, pointers and spaniels to create an entirely new breed of dog: the Irish Setter. Setters detected birds and flushed them out of their hiding spots. Then the hunter shot the bird, and the dog retrieved the body and brought it back.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Irish Setter in 1878, making this bird dog one of the earliest breeds to ever be recognized by the organization. As the Irish Setter's history continued, this breed quickly became one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States.\r\n\r\nToday, some Irish Setters are still used as game dogs. Many more, however, live happy, fulfilled lives in homes with families. Puppies typically cost anywhere between $800 and $3,500, with $1,000 a common Irish Setter price. For that price, you'll likely get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
