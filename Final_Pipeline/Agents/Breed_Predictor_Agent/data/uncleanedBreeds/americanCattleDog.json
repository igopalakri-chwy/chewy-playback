        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EThe origin of the Australian Cattle Dog began in the 19th century when the British brought the Smithfield sheepdog to Australia. This dog, however, did not fare too well on the rough terrain and sweltering heat, so Australian settlers quickly sought to create a herding breed to thrive in that environment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially, Smithfields were bred with dingoes as well as the Scottish Highland Collie. The Blue Heeler we know today is a cross between a mixed dingo-Collie breed and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/dalmatian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDalmatian\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile their history began in Australia, the breed first came to America in 1950. Australian Cattle Dogs were admitted to American Kennel Club in 1980, and they became a charter member of AKC Herding Group at its inception.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen looking for information on the Australian Cattle Dog, you'll find this breed has plenty of aliases, including the Queensland Heeler (a nod to its origins) and Blue Heeler. The term heeler came to be associated with them as a clever reference to their herding style of nipping at the heels of cattle to move them along, while the term blue refers to their popular blue-gray speckled coats.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you're looking for an Australian Cattle Dog puppy, you can find reputable breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/australian-cattle-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. You can expect puppies to cost between $600-$1,000, but they can go upwards of $2,000 for championship lines. For that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, reach out to Blue Heeler rescues or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
