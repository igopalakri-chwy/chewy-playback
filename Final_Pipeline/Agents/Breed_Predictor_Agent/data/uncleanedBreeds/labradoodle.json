        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cp\u003EBefore Labradoodles became designer dogs, they were working dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first Labradoodle puppies were bred in 1989 by Wally Conron, a breeder who worked with the \u003Ca href=\"https://guidedogs.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERoyal Guide Dogs Association of Australia\u003C/a\u003E. A blind woman in Hawaii had contacted the organization and asked for a service dog who wouldn’t trigger her husband’s allergies.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConron thought of the Standard Poodle, a breed known for being hypoallergenic. Combined with the friendly and trainable personality of the Labrador Retriever—already a reliable guide dog breed—Conron hoped to create a breed that could serve as excellent guide dogs for people with both vision impairment and allergies. \u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first known litter included a Labradoodle puppy named Sultan, who became a successful guide dog for the woman in Hawaii.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBut when Conron tried to find work for the remaining Labradoodle puppies, he found that people weren’t interested in trusting a crossbreed as their service dog. Up to this point, crossbreeds were not popular. So in an attempt to make his breed more appealing, Conron gave them a special name. \u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E“He made them sound more unique than simply referring to them as a ‘crossbreed’ by using a combination of names,” Dr. Faulkner says. “And of course, this idea has caught on with many crosses over the last 10–15 years.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Labradoodle rebrand was a success, and the breed’s popularity took off. Today, the Labradoodle is one of the most popular designer dog breeds, although they’re not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECurious about where you can find a Labradoodle to call your own? Look for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/how-to-find-ethical-reputable-responsible-breeder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ereputable breeders\u003C/a\u003E with healthy, happy, outgoing dogs. Labradoodle price points can range from $1,000–$4,000, and depend on factors such as age and generation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re looking to cut down on the cost or support dogs in special need of a home, you can look for Labradoodle rescue dogs instead. Check Labradoodle rescue sites such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.idogrescue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EIDOG Rescue, Inc.\u003C/a\u003E, for Labradoodle adoption opportunities, or call your local shelter to see if there are any doodles available.\u003C/p\u003E",
