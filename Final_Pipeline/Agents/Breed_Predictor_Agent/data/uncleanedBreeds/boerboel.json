If you are interested in this procedure, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian.\u003C/p\u003E",
        "h2_breed_temperament": "Because the Boerboel was bred to be a guard dog, these giant pups are fiercely loyal to their loved ones. Their loyalty to their family means they will put themselves in harm's way to keep you safe.\r\n\r\nThey're also often described as being a great playmate for kids; they'll let children they know well crawl all over them. Even with their playful nature, these are powerful dogs, so all interactions with kids need to be supervised. That goes double when neighborhood kids are in the mix. If your dog misinterprets a friend's actions as a threat instead of play, they will protect your child. So, not only is it important to train and socialize your dog early, but it's also important to teach kids how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBoerboels are on guard duty 24/7. Even when playing with you, they've got one eye looking for trouble. They are wary with strangers and will not let someone they don't know into your home. You'll always need to make proper introductions between new guests and your pup when meeting for the first time. (Emily Post would be so proud.) But once your dog knows you consider them a friend, they'll consider them one, too.\r\n\r\nThis mastiff-type dog does best in a home where they're your one and only, but may do OK with other dogs or cats if raised with them from puppyhood. As with all interactions, proper socialization, starting when they're a puppy, is important to get them used to meeting new people, dogs and situations.\r\n\r\nBoerboels are strong dogs with a high level of intelligence, and they need a confident and calm pup parent to show them the ropes. The strength and size of the Boerboel is often intimidating to people looking for their first pet, so these dogs are best suited to someone who's had a dog before.",

They're looking to you to guide them, and if you don't, they'll fill the leadership vacuum themselves. Remember, these dogs need a confident and calm pup parent.

Because they were bred to guard and protect, these instincts may go into overdrive in a home with people constantly in and out of the front door.\r\n\r\nBecause these powerful dogs need a calm and confident leader, Boerboels often thrive with someone who's had a dog before.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Boerboel's history and origin begins in South Africa, when Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Town, first brought a dog to the Cape in 1652. As more Dutch, German and Huguenot settlers (Boers) arrived in South Africa, they brought large guard dogs for protection and big-game hunting.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, a dog crossed between a Mastiff and Bulldog resulted in a Boer Hunting Dog or Boer Dog. Over time, Boer Dogs were bred with other bulldog and South African mastiff types, possibly including the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bullmastiff/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBullmastiff\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/rhodesian-ridgeback/\"\u003ERhodesian Ridgeback\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bulldog/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEnglish Bulldog\u003C/a\u003E and the Khoikohoi or Khoisan dogs, resulting in the Boerboel dog we know today.\r\n\r\nThe Boerboel breed's instincts led them to be excellent guard dogs, fending off wild animals and protecting diamond mines and farms from would-be thieves. According to legend, the dogs even fought lions—but these dogs aren't prone to fight, as they typically hold down their game when hunting.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 2014 and joined the Working group in 2015. (The Working group consists of dogs born to do a job, like guarding or search-and-rescue.) While not the most popular pup—they \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/most-popular-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecurrently rank No. 123 out of 200\u003C/a\u003E—they are fervently adored by their families and fans.\r\n\r\nReady to bring a Boerboel into your life?
