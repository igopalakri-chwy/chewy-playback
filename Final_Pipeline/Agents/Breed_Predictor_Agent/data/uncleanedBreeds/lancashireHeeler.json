As a result, Lancashire Heelers were placed on their home country’s vulnerable native breed list in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Lancashire Heeler didn’t gain official AKC membership status until 2024. And interestingly, while there are several dogs that have the term “Heeler” in their nickname (for example, the Blue Heeler), the Lancashire Heeler is the only breed recognized by the AKC with “Heeler” in the official breed name.
