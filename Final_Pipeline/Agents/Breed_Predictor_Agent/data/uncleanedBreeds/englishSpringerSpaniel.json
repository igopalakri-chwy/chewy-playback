Bred to be out in the fields hunting with people, their philosophy is \"the more, the merrier.\" Springers love to please their people, which makes them very trainable.\n\nBecause they love their people so much, they need a home where someone will be with them for most of the day.

If you're not able to be with them, check them into doggy daycare or arrange for a neighbor or pet sitter to come by for playtime.\n\nSpeaking of playtime, Springer Spaniel dogs are very playful, making them great with older kids as long as they are properly socialized from an early age and the kids are taught how to properly interact with dogs. These pups are very active and may knock over toddlers and babies during play (so be sure to supervise play times!). Their super-friendly nature extends to other dogs, but not to cats. (They were bred to hunt and will give chase. )\n\nThese dogs are very intelligent and have an independent streak, so training needs to start early and be consistent. Their intelligence and independence make them better suited to someone who has experience with dogs, but they can be good for a new pup parent who is willing to commit to the necessary training. (Say goodbye to Saturdays off!)\n\nThese pups have a lot of energy and need both mental and physical stimulation. Always remember that a tired Springer is a well-mannered Springer. And if your pup isn't getting the exercise and attention they need, they may resort to coming up with their own entertainment, and that'll include chewing your shoes and digging in your yard.",

These pups shed moderately, and twice a year (spring and fall), they'll up their shedding game. So, plan on brushing them daily during shedding season.

If you think it's easier to give this pup a shave, think again. Shaving damages the coat, and it may not grow back properly.

        "training": "As you train your English Springer Spaniel puppy, it's important to remember that Springers love to please their people, and they really do want to make you happy. But—these pups are smart, independent and want to hunt.

These pups are friendly, and you want to create as many positive experiences as you can while they're puppies. Enroll your English Springer Spaniel puppy in puppy school; they'll learn how to play nicely with other puppies and get to meet new adults. (And you may pick up a few new friends for puppy playdates. Win, win!)\n\nTeach your pup basic commands like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E. These commands are important for their safety. But even though your pup may know these commands and respond well in enclosed environments, like your backyard, never ever trust your pup off-leash when out in the open (unless you're hunting, obvi). These dogs were bred to hunt (especially of birds), and they'll take off in hot pursuit, regardless of how loudly you call them back. For their own safety (and quite frankly, your sanity), always keep them on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/leashes-346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eleash\u003C/a\u003E when you're not in a fenced area.\n\nSpringers need a confident and calm trainer, which is why they often do best with an experienced pup parent.

Be sure to choose a formula that fits their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) and look for the statement that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the proper weight for your Spaniel is crucial to their health and well-being; even an extra pound or two can make a difference. As you're planning mealtimes, don't forget all the treats you give as part of training or just because you love your pup. Those calories count, too! If you see your pup beginning to pack on the pounds, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a meal and exercise plan to shed the weight and still maintain your pup's nutritional needs.",

A bored pup will create their own entertainment, and for the sake of your favorite pair of shoes, keep them busy!\n\nAnd remember, unless you're hunting with your pup, don't let your dog off-leash outside of a fenced yard. They'll catch sight of a bird or other animal and will give chase (these pups are built for bursts of speed), and they won't pay attention as they cross the street or hear you calling for them to come back until they've ended their chase.",
        "ideal_environment": "English Springer Spaniels dream of a home with lots of land where they can play and explore with their family. They may do OK in small homes and apartments if you have access to enclosed outdoor spaces where you can let them play. They do well with active single people or families, but they do need you to be home with them for most of the day. If you are gone often, this may not be the best dog for you.\r\n\r\nSpringers love playing with kids, and because they're so very playful, they will need to be supervised around small kids and babies.

        "h2_breed_history": "It's likely the English Springer Spaniel finds their origins in Spain, but they're mainly known as descendants of the English Spaniels of Norfolk or Shropshire in the mid-19th century. These hunting dogs accompanied hunters and flushed (or sprung) birds from the brush, earmarking them as \"Springers.\" Once upon a time, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/english-cocker-spaniel/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEnglish Cocker Spaniel\u003C/a\u003E and the English Springer Spaniel were the same breed. Larger pups of a litter were used as \"springers,\" and smaller pups were used for hunting woodcocks.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Springer Spaniels were divided into two distinct breeds, the English Springer Spaniel and the Welsh Springer Spaniel, by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel in 1910; and today, the pup ranks No. 27 on the AKC's popularity list.\r\n\r\nWant to add an English Springer Spaniel to your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/english-springer-spaniel?breed=103&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC website\u003C/a\u003E. The average price for a puppy is $800-$2,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, contact an English Springer Spaniel rescue or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
