But their independent streak can make it a challenge for them to pick up on the basics, like house training, walking nicely on a leash and commands like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E.

Again, positive reinforcement (where you reward your dog for good behavior) and consistency (sticking to a set schedule of frequent bathroom breaks) will go a long way to ensuring they go when and where they're supposed to.\n\nBichons do not like to be alone and small changes in your routine—such as spending a few too many hours out of the house—may result in unwanted behaviors like bathroom accidents, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\"\u003Ebarking\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-tips-how-to-stop-destructive-chewing-in-dogs\"\u003Echewing your shoes\u003C/a\u003E.

To crate train:\n\u003Col\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003EFirst, you'll need to get them used to the crate in general (get the how-to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-how-to-make-crate-training-easy-for-your-pet-and-you\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003EThen, you can work on leaving them alone while they are in the crate. Begin with short intervals, like 5 minutes. Put your pup in the crate with a high-value treat or toy and leave the room.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003EWhen you come back, calmly praise your pup for a job well done. If they cry or whine, start with a shorter time.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDo this daily, gradually increasing the time you're away.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\nSome Bichons may never be OK with you being gone for long. In that case, consider hiring a dog walker or sending them to doggy daycare on the days you're out of the house for more than a few hours.\n\nWhile your Bichon may be your BFF, beware of a side effect: a Bichon may take those \"we're equal\" vibes as an opportunity to get their way, which can look like nudges, extra licks and extra barks. The trick is to subtly teach your dog that you're in charge. One thing that can help is to make sure that your praise (like saying, \"Good pup!\") is meaningful. Smartypants Bichons easily connect words to actions, and if you're constantly using pet names—even when all they're doing is lounging on the couch—can minimize the importance of the words you use when they do matter. Make sure you use positive reinforcement whenever they do something good and redirect any unwanted behavior to something positive, rather than caving to every inopportune knee nuzzle with a cuddle.\n\nNurture your Bichon's intelligence and love of learning by teaching them new tricks throughout their lives. A Bichon enjoys mastering a new skill, so regularly set aside time for training. (They learn a new skill, and they get to spend more time with you—it's a win-win!)",
        "diet_nutrition": "Because a Bichon is so small, every calorie counts; and it's important they get optimum nutrition with every meal. Your vet is in the best position to help you choose the most appropriate food and feeding plan for your pet, based on their age and activity level.\n\nSome Bichon families want to meet their pup's nutritional needs by DIY-ing their meals with a mixture of meat, dairy products, fruits, veggies and potatoes, but check with your vet to make sure your meals have the proper nutrition breakdown. There are plenty of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecommercial options\u003C/a\u003E that are convenient for you and good for your Bichon, too. Look on the packaging for a statement that says the food meets the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aafco.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAssociation of American Feed Control Officials\u003C/a\u003E (AAFCO) standards for a complete and balanced diet.\n\nA Bichon's diet is often reflected in the way their skin and coat look and feel. Itchy, dry skin or a lank, dull coat may be early signs that your pup's diet isn't ideal. Keep an eye out for these signs during your regular grooming sessions. If you suspect a problem, talk to your veterinarian.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for how is many treats you're feeding. It's tempting to reward a Bichon frequently, even for just being cute, but the breed can be prone to obesity and treats quickly add up calorie-wise. Small morsels of healthy treats—think frozen \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/nutrition-pet-diet-tips-can-dogs-eat-blueberries\"\u003Eblueberries\u003C/a\u003E or small pieces of cut-up \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/nutrition-pet-diet-tips-10-best-fruits-vegetables-for-dogs\"\u003Efruits and veggies\u003C/a\u003E—can be good options. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDehydrated meat-based treats\u003C/a\u003E are also healthy in moderation, but make sure to keep treats in check.",
        "exercise": "A Bichon Frise may never compete in a marathon (unless we're talking a Netflix bingefest with you), but that doesn't mean the breed is a couch potato. The Bichon Frise is a naturally fast runner (you'll be surprised by their speed!), so beware if you let an untrained Bichon off-leash.\r\n\r\nYou can fulfill their exercise needs with small \"movement breaks\" throughout the day (about 30 minutes a day). This may include regular walks around the neighborhood once or twice a day, a few low-key fetch sessions and some time to sniff around the backyard or a nearby park. You can pull double-duty with the training and engage their brains and their bodies by participating in agility courses or obedience trials.",
        "ideal_environment": "Good news, city dwellers! The Bichon Frise easily adapts to apartment living. They are friendly with your neighbors, don't bark a lot and don't need a lot of exercise. They do love to sniff and explore the outdoors, so make time for regular outdoor walks (or time to run around the backyard or dog park) to keep your Bichon happy and in shape. The most important factor for Bichons is time with the humans who matter to them the most. They thrive in homes where someone will be with them throughout the day.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Bichons have a history full of folklore that would make for a fascinating drama—their origins are shrouded in mystery. (Are they Egyptian? Maybe Greco-Roman.) Regardless, it's widely believed a popular, small white dog is the ancestor to the modern Bichon. (Side note: These dogs were so desirable, they were often used for bartering—apparently even Cleopatra adored the \"little white dog\"!)\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that the Bichon began their journey to becoming the dog we love today on the Canary Islands (Tenerife, to be precise). There, the four \"cousins\" (Havanese, Maltese, Bolognese and Bichon) were developed and called barbichons. The Bichon, so closely tied to the island, was known as the Tenerife Bichon.\r\n\r\nAround the 13th century, Bichon Frises were brought to the European mainland and were the delight of royal courts across the continent; you often see them in paintings from the Renaissance era. It's been said that King Henry III of France was so taken with the breed, he carried a few with him everywhere in a shallow basket suspended by neck ribbons! (Truly, the Bichon was the \"it\" accessory of the day.)\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, as revolutions swept the world, the Bichon breed became collateral damage. Instead of living in palaces, they were living on the street. But don't fret! This is not where our story ends. Street performers found that the Bichon's winning personality and quick-study intellect made them ideal performing partners. Soon, these plucky pups graced European circuses with their delightful presence.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, Bichons again became collateral damage to global forces. Both world wars shook Europe, reducing the demand for circus dogs. The breed faced extinction, but Bichon lovers found surviving dogs and led the charge for modern breed recognition. In 1933, France's Societe Centrale Canine coined the Bichon breed \"Bichon a Poil Frise,\" meaning \"Bichon of the curly hair.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1956, Bichons made their way to California, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://bichon.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBichon Frise Club of America\u003C/a\u003E was founded in 1964. The American Kennel Club added them to the Miscellaneous class in 1971 (dogs on their way to AKC status), and they received their full breed recognition in 1973.\r\n\r\nWant to add a Bichon Frise as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/bichon-frise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC website\u003C/a\u003E. A Bichon Frise puppy can cost between $600-$1,000. But for that, you usually get a dog screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also look for the breed at local Bichon Frise rescues or animal shelters (a great way to give a fully grown Bichon some much-needed love!). You can also search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-bichon-frise_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area. Don't forget to include regular grooming as part of your \"Bichon budget\" as well as other expenses such as vet visits, food and treats.\r\n\r\nSometimes unscrupulous breeders will use terms to charge you more money for a puppy. The AKC does not recognize \"teacup Bichon Frises.\" These tiny dogs were often bred for the recessive dwarf gene. While they may look cute, these dogs may actually have more health issues down the road than a normal Bichon would. Also, if anyone tries to sell you a \"rare\" black Bichon—run. It's possible the pup is a Poochon (Bichon-Poodle mix), but a purebred Bichon is always white.",
