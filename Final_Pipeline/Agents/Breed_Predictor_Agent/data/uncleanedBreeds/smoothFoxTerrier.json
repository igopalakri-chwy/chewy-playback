If you are interested in this procedure, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian. \u003C/p\u003E",
        "h2_breed_temperament": "Active, intelligent, gregarious and inquisitive—that's the Smooth Fox Terrier. There's a lot of energy packed into that little body. These dogs often express themselves in comical and entertaining ways, like burying underneath a pile of cushions with nothing but a cute, waggy tail sticking out. They adore people and would do anything to please you—but with a strong prey drive, they'll quickly abandon you to give chase if a critter scurries by.\n\nSome of these qualities can get the Fox Terrier in trouble, especially in a multi-pet home. With their energetic personality and strong hunting instincts, they'll need considerable training on order to resist chasing your cat or other small pets; they may do best in a home without them. They also don't get along particularly well with other dogs unless properly socialized. If you're adopting an older Smooth Fox Terrier, it might be too late to temper these tendencies. If you're bringing a Fox Terrier puppy into the household, the expression of these traits can be kept in check through early \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E (exposure to new people, pets and experiences) and training.\n\nThankfully, though, this feisty attitude towards other animals doesn't apply to humans. With people, they're usually lively, engaged and eager to please. They won't typically bite a person unless they're cornered and feel like they're in danger. A Smooth Fox Terrier puppy starts out quite vocal when it comes to barking and, unlike some other breeds, they won't grow out of it. To keep this from becoming a nuisance, consider training to help \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecurb the barking\u003C/a\u003E from a young age.\n\nTraining is typically easy for a Smooth Fox Terrier thanks to their intelligence, so this is likely to be a great bonding and rewarding experience for both of you.",

With their sharp intellect and abundant energy, they can turn to troublesome digging or stealing food from the dinner table if healthy outlets for these traits aren't provided. To stimulate their minds and bodies, daily exercise and consistent training are an absolute must. On the other hand, their grooming needs are pretty low—just schedule in a weekly brush to keep their coats clear of dead hair.",
        "grooming": "Smooth Fox Terriers are relatively low maintenance in the grooming department, so they're easy to keep in show dog shape. These smooth-coated pups have short, thick hair that sheds minimally throughout most of the year but somewhat heavily when the weather changes during the spring and fall. To minimize shedding, use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/rubber-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f7v85547\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Erubber slicker brush\u003C/a\u003E or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-gloves_c355_f70v83788\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Egrooming glove\u003C/a\u003E to remove excess shed fur. Regular brushing should be done once a week for most of the year and every other day during their seasonal shed.\n\nFox Terrier dogs are pretty easy to keep clean; you should only need to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebathe\u003C/a\u003E them once every four to six weeks. If they somehow find themselves in the middle of a mud puddle between regular baths, just take them in, towel them off then let them dry; most of the dirt will fall right off. You can always keep them smelling like roses with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/deodorizing-sprays-colognes-2461\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog cologne\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nTheir \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enails need to be trimmed\u003C/a\u003E about every two weeks (assuming they haven't already been worn down by exercise). When you hear them tapping on your hardwood floor then it's time to get the clippers out.\n\nDental hygiene is also important for your Smooth Fox Terrier's health, so aim to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebrush their teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily. Take them to the vet once a year for a dental check-up and professional cleaning, too, to be doubly-sure their mouths are in good condition.\n\nYour Smooth Fox Terrier's ears can get a build up of wax or debris, which can cause them discomfort and infections. Check them regularly for redness, swelling and debris, and call your vet if you notice anything unusual.

        "training": "The Smooth Fox Terrier dog breed is smart, attentive and eager to please, which makes them wonderful students. They do have an independent streak, however, so their trainers (that's you) need to be confident, clear and consistent. Training for Smooth Fox Terriers should begin early on; the sooner you begin, the better. Start your puppy on the right paw once you get them home with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/new-dog/basic-puppy-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuppy training 101\u003C/a\u003E class that teaches them the basics, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E. With their strong prey drive, it's best to train them in a place with few distractions so they're better able to focus.\n\nIt's also well worth spending time on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esocialization training\u003C/a\u003E with your pup. This gets them accustomed to meeting and greeting people and other dogs who'll they encounter on almost every adventure.\n\nBecause these dogs are such enthusiastic learners, they're always paying attention and picking up on behaviors—even when you're not intentionally trying to teach them. That means you have to be deliberate and consistent with your training at all times, including when you're just hanging out at home. Make sure to keep any house-rules in action, even during playtime, or you may end up with the contents of your laundry hamper scattered about the living room.\n\nLike other breeds, the Smooth Fox Terrier responds best to positive reinforcement (rewarding good behavior with treats, toys and praise). So go ahead, let your pup know when they've been a very good dog, and always have a few \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etraining treats\u003C/a\u003E close at hand.\n\nTraining your Smooth Fox Terrier is a daily commitment because they are quite stubborn and are likely to pick up bad habits that are hard to shake. So keep training consistent, frequent and interesting, especially if you like the unchewed look of the legs on your dining table.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Smooth Fox Terriers are very good eaters (and not terribly picky) so they can easily thrive on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E, as long as it's complete and balanced and tailored for their age (puppy, adult, or senior), weight and activity level. Most young and active dogs require a bit more protein, but consult with your vet on what the best diet and feeding schedule is for your fur baby.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the food is nutritionally complete and balanced, look at the bag to see if it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This non-profit organization is responsible for setting quality, safety and nutritional criteria for dog food in the US; high-quality kibble will meet these standards and provide your dog with the nutrition they need to stay healthy.\r\n\r\nTreats are an absolute must (at least according to your dog). Since Smooth Fox Terriers, like most dogs, are highly motivated by food, treats will keep them focused during training sessions. You'll also need to keep some around to encourage positive behaviors throughout the day. But be careful not to overfeed them. While extra calories can be burned off during exercise, too many treats will turn your Smooth Fox Terrier into a chubby pup, leading to a risk of health issues like heart disease.",
        "exercise": "Smooth Fox Terriers have a high energy level, which means their exercise needs are considerable. Ideally, they'll get at least two hours of moderate to vigorous activity per day. The good news is that this exercise can take practically any form: They love to swim, run, play and explore, so you can take your pick!\r\n\r\nHiking is another great choice, but only on leash. Smooth Fox Terriers are known for their speed and hunting abilities, so if they smell or see a squirrel, mouse, rabbit or any other interesting critter, they're likely to give chase. Don't risk them running off into the woods—keep them on leash and skip the high drama of a pursuit.\r\n\r\nThanks to their history of hunting fox, this tenacious breed also excels at digging. If you're looking for a little help in the garden, you've found the ideal companion. But if you like to keep your flower beds nice and tidy, it's best to channel that energy into something more productive, like nose work, agility events and other dog sports.",
        "ideal_environment": "With their high energy and loving nature, Smooth Fox Terriers are the perfect match for an active family, and they are great with children. But terrier breeds do tend to guard their resources, so make sure kids know to respect the dog's space, especially when your pup has food or toys.\r\n\r\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier's love of people also extends to those who aren't family members. Whenever you have guests over, your dog will welcome your visitors with lots of love and kisses, like they're seeing an old friend for the first time in years.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this love doesn't apply to other pets. They can often get rowdy with other dogs in the household and may chase smaller pets. If you have gerbils, guinea pigs or rabbits in your home, it's best to look for another breed. If introduced to other dogs and cats while they're still a puppy, Smooth Fox Terriers can learn to adapt, especially with other dogs of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier dog breed needs space to run around and play, so they're best suited to a single-family home with a large yard. They can adapt to an apartment, but only if they're provided with plenty of exercise every day. Otherwise you'll end up with a bored, restless dog who burns energy by chewing up your furniture. If outdoor activity is out of the question because of inclement weather, entertain them with some \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/interactive-toys-319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Einteractive toys\u003C/a\u003E.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Smooth Fox Terrier breed originated in 18th century England, where they were bred for fox hunting.

Their unique V-shaped head also helped during the hunt; it was perfectly shaped to enter a fox den.\r\n\r\nBreed standards for Fox Terriers have been in place for more than a hundred years. These guidelines describe ideal Fox Terrier characteristics including height, weight and color in addition to ear, eye, tail and head shape. The standards were first set by England's Fox Terrier Club upon its inception in 1876.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take long for the Fox Terrier dog breed to make its way to the United States; they were in the country by 1879, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aftc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Fox Terrier Club\u003C/a\u003E was founded soon after in 1885. The Fox Terrier was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in the same year and is part of the Terrier group. In fact, the American Fox Terrier Club was the first specialty breed club to become a member of the AKC.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Smooth Fox Terriers and Wire Fox Terriers were treated as variations of the same breed. Though they're similar in name, stature and ability, we now know that they developed independently from one another. In 1985, the AKC formally recognized this fact and declared them to be two separate dog breeds. The breed standards for both Smooth Fox Terriers and Wire Fox Terriers are maintained by the American Fox Terrier Club to this day.\r\n\r\nWhile the breed enjoyed considerable popularity in the UK, they remain relatively unknown in the US; the Smooth Fox Terrier currently ranks 123rd out of the AKC's 197 recognized dog breeds. Despite this lack of appreciation, these charming dogs make wonderful family members. The cost of a Smooth Fox Terrier puppy usually runs between $1,500 and $2,000. For this price you're getting a dog who's been screened for health and behavioral issues and may even come with papers. You can find reputable breeders through the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/smooth-fox-terrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC website\u003C/a\u003E. You could always consider adopting a Smooth Fox Terrier, too.
