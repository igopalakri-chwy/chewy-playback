Don't plan on putting your pup out in the backyard by their lonesome—running around by themselves won't cut it for this breed! Barbets enjoy a variety of activities from running and swimming to dog sports like agility, rally, dock diving and lure coursing (chasing a lure around a track).\n\nDespite their high exercise needs, once you wear out your Barbet, they're happy to hang out with you.

This may lead to the bones rubbing, grinding or popping out of place, causing discomfort and pain for your dog. These genetic disorders can be confirmed with an X-ray. Symptoms for hip dysplasia include “bunny hopping,” difficulty getting up or reduced activity. Symptoms for elbow dysplasia include limping, puffy elbows or front paws pointing outwards. Treatments for hip and elbow dysplasia may include weight reduction, exercise restriction, physical therapy, supplements, anti-inflammatory medications or surgery.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559685&quot;:1117}\"\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;multilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/condition/progressive-retinal-atrophy-in-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003EProgressive Retinal Atrophy\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003E (PRA)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cspan data-contrast=\"none\"\u003E: This degenerative disease affects a dog’s photoreceptor cells in the retina, eventually causing blindness.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Barbet gets their name from their distinctive beard, or \u003Cem\u003Ebarbe\u003C/em\u003E in French. These water-loving pups were first mentioned in 16th century France as a dog who was bred for hunting water game and were used to locate, flush and retrieve birds.\r\n\r\nThe Barbet is often thought to be one of the breeds that make up popular dogs like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/poodle/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPoodle\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBichon Frise\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/briard/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBriard\u003C/a\u003E and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/newfoundland/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENewfoundland\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nThe Barbet is a rare breed. After almost completely disappearing after both World Wars, this French water dog is making a slow comeback thanks to the efforts of dedicated breeders around the world. They first came to the United States in the fall of 2000, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in January 2020 as their 194th breed.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in raising a Barbet? Be prepared to be patient; these pups are rare, so you may have to wait up to a year to find your BFF. You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/barbet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average Barbet puppy price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend $2,500–$4,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a Barbet puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. Because this pup's so rare, it's uncommon to find this breed in a rescue or shelter.",
