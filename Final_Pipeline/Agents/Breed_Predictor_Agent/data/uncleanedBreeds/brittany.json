And these high-energy pups enjoy a lot of activity, so plan on them running with you every morning. Just be prepared for shouts of “Pretty dog!\" and “Go, puppy, go!\" Your friendly pup will manage a cheerful smile and a butt wiggle without missing a step.\r\n\r\nThough playful and energetic, Brittanies are not fans of homes with a lot of chaos.

        "training": "Training is a must for the Brittany , especially for Brittany puppies. Their intelligent mind leads them to independent thinking, and, as hunting dogs, they have a strong prey drive. Starting training while they're a puppy helps them more readily adapt to your way of thinking.\n\nTeach them the fundamentals like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E. These skills are important to help keep them safe and well-mannered as they grow up. But it's important to understand that these pups have strong hunting instincts that you're never going to completely train out of them, like their desire to chase.\n\nLike all dogs (and you!), Brittanies respond well to reward-based training, aka positive reinforcement. Reward them when they do a good job with treats, lots of praise and play breaks with fun toys, and redirect them when they don't do what you want them to do. And be sure to take a break or a walk before either of you gets frustrated. Keep training fun for both of you!\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003ESocialization\u003C/a\u003E is another necessity for this social butterfly. They need to know what behaviors are appropriate when meeting someone, furry or not, outside their family. Take your puppy on walks and let them meet new people and dogs you pass by. Consider enrolling them in puppy school, too, where they can learn to play nicely with other puppies and mix and mingle with other people all in one location.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Brittany dogs typically do well on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for the statement on the packaging that says the food meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nBecause your Brittany is so high energy, your vet may recommend slightly larger portions, more frequent feedings, or a high-protein food. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality treats will also be a hit with your puppy, and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esmall training treats\u003C/a\u003E are great for teaching tricks and practicing obedience. Remember that treats equal calories, though, so make sure they don't overindulge. If you notice your pup gaining a little extra weight, chat with your vet. They can help you put together an exercise and diet plan to help your pup lose the weight and maintain the nutrition they need.",
        "exercise": "Run, walk, play, rinse, repeat. Your bundle of fun will need lots of exercise. Lots. Brittany dogs are athletes through and through, and plenty of exercise—think 60-90 minutes throughout the day—keeps them happy, healthy and out of trouble. If you don't fulfill your dog's energy levels every day, they're creative and will come up with their own ways to entertain themselves, and your favorite heels or your flower garden may not appreciate their efforts.\n\nOne benefit of lots of exercise is that they get to spend plenty of time with you, which will always be their favorite thing to do. Lace-up your sneakers and snap on your pup's leash for your morning run. Take them on weekend outings as you explore the Great Outdoors full of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/ready-to-hit-the-hiking-trail-with-your-dog-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\"\u003Ehikes\u003C/a\u003E, camping trips and other adventures.\n\nIf you enjoy a bit of friendly competition, get involved in dog sports. Because these pups were bred to be versatile, they excel at a variety of sports, including \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, tracking, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience\u003C/a\u003E, to name a few. And these sports pull double-duty as training activities. #doublewin\n\nIf you want to take advantage of your dog's gorgeous look, Brittanies do well in the show ring, too. Brittany dogs are one of those rare breeds who often win titles in both the field and in conformation (dog shows). Either way, you're guaranteed to have a lot of fun, and you may come home with a few championship ribbons to show off.\n\nThese pups have a strong prey drive. After all, they were born to be pointing dogs, where they chase and point at their quarry, so hunters can find them. Always have your pup on a leash when you're not in an enclosed area, like a fenced yard. These pups will chase everything they think needs chasing, and no amount of training—or yelling as they speed away—will stop them until they've finished the chase. And they won't look both ways before crossing the street. So, for your sanity and their safety, always keep them on a leash.",
        "ideal_environment": "Brittany dogs need a home where they'll get a lot of love and a ton of exercise. They really need a home with a fenced backyard where they can safely run around and stretch their legs during a rousing game of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-dog-to-fetch\"\u003Efetch\u003C/a\u003E, and therefore, aren't ideal for smaller places like apartments.\n\nThe breed is an exceptional family dog who loves kids, although you'll want to supervise them around smaller kids and babies, as your pup may accidentally knock a tot over in their enthusiasm. Brittanies get along great with other dogs in the home, and they can get along with cats if raised together from puppyhood. But they do have strong hunting instincts, so small animals will be chased.\n\nBrittanies need lots of attention and time with their humans. If you're lucky enough to work from home, you might possibly be their favorite person ever. If you have to be gone for long, schedule time at doggy daycare or arrange for a neighbor or pet sitter to come by and play with your pup. If you travel a lot, this may not be the dog for you—they will miss you way too much!",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Brittany breed's origins come from the Brittany region of France, likely in the 17th century. We all like to show off our fur babies, and the people of that time were no different. Hunting dogs who resemble the Brittany breed show up in paintings and tapestries from around that time, like their close relatives, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/english-setter/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEnglish Setters\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nIn the 1600s, only nobles and wealthy landowners had enough money to keep entire kennels of dogs specialized for different types of hunting. Commoners, and sometimes poachers, needed all-purpose dogs who could point, flush and retrieve. The Brittany, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/german-shorthaired-pointer/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGerman Shorthaired Pointer\u003C/a\u003E, is a versatile hunting pup. The Brittany was also bred to be an adept bird dog.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed, then known as the Brittany Spaniel, in 1934. The breed first became popular in the United States in the 1940s, and today is No. 28 on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/most-popular-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's most popular dog breed list\u003C/a\u003E. Their versatility is part of what makes them so popular. Unlike many breeds, Brittanies are considered to be a dual breed, meaning they excel at both conformation competitions and field trials. In fact, the Brittany breed has the most dual champions of any AKC Sporting breed. (Sporting dogs were bred to work with hunters.) To be a dual champion, the dog must be a finished show champion and a field champion of record.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to buy a Brittany puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/brittany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. Prices for a Brittany puppy range $700-$1,000. But for that price, you likely get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.

Check out the \u003Ca href=\"https://americanbrittanyrescue.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Brittany Rescue\u003C/a\u003E, or keep an eye out for the pup at your local animal shelter.
