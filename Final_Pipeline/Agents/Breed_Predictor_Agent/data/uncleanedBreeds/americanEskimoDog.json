Many Eskie parents even swear their dogs can learn just by watching other dogs!\n\nAn American Eskimo puppy is eager for your attention, so training is a perfect way to bond with them as well as teach them proper manners. With their one-two combo of eager-to-please personality and trainability, you'll be able to teach them as many tricks as you want. Plus, training is a fantastic way to exercise their intelligent minds (and helps wear them out).\n\nWhen you're working with an American Eskimo puppy, focus on basic behaviors like house-training and household manners (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E,\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E stay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E are a great place to start). Be sure to use positive reinforcement (treats, toys and praise) to encourage your pup—it'll keep you both from getting frustrated. A good puppy preschool that uses positive reinforcement can help you and your puppy start off on the right paw. Puppy preschool is a great way to introduce your puppy to different people, dogs, objects and sounds, which lays the groundwork for important life skills and experiences.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The American Eskimo Dog breed typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their activity level and life stage, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior dog. Look for a statement on food's packaging to make sure it meets nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nIf you notice your pup starting to add a little extra fluff, talk to your vet. Even an extra pound on a small dog can create significant health issues down the road for your pup. Your vet can help you create a diet and exercise plan designed to help your pup shed the extra weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nWhile it's always helpful to have some tasty treats on hand for rewards, remember that treats also add calories to your dog's diet. If you're watching your dog's weight, opt for low-calorie treats or mix in playtime with a special toy as part of the rewards you give. If you have any questions, check with your vet. They're in the best position to help you find the right mix of food, portions and timing for your pup's unique needs.",
        "exercise": "American Eskimo Dogs are high energy, so be prepared to exercise them accordingly! Plan on spending at least 30 minutes every day to successfully exhaust their reserves. Walks and hikes can be a good way to give your dog both the exercise and social time they need to thrive. A rigorous game of fetch in a fenced-in backyard is also a welcome activity for your Eskie.\r\n\r\nYou can also get your American Eskimo involved in a variety of dog sports. Options like agility, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.flyball.org/aboutflyball.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E and dock diving can be fun for both you and your dog, and the Eskie's natural speed is well-suited for these fast-paced sports. Your dog will get to burn off energy, while you'll enjoy the challenge of learning something new and training your dog for these sports.",
        "ideal_environment": "An American Eskimo Dog can make a good family pup for experienced pet parents. With training and socialization, this breed can be good with kids, and their highly social nature can make for engaging playtime for the whole family.\r\n\r\nThis breed tends to also be good with other dogs and cats. Keep in mind that if your Eskie doesn't get enough exercise or is left alone for too long, they can get very active and might annoy the quieter pets, like cats, in your home. If you'll be gone for long, it's a good idea to check them into doggy daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or friend to come by and play with them.\r\n\r\nThese dogs can be very social, but some are a little hesitant when meeting new people. They form strong connections with their humans, so if an Eskie lets you into their heart, plan on spending plenty of time with your new pal.\r\n\r\nThese small dogs do well in homes with large yards where they can run around and play with you, but they also do well in apartments as long as you're also able to provide them with the exercise they need every day.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The American Eskimo breed has its origins in dogs who lived 6,000 years ago. These Nordic breeds, also called the German Spitz dogs, included the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pomeranian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPomeranian\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/samoyed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESamoyed\u003C/a\u003E and Keeshond. These pups possess many of the distinctive traits the Eskie reflects today, including double coats and pointed ears.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1800s, German immigrants began settling in America. These farmers brought along their beautiful and easily trainable companions: German Spitz dogs. Around this time, traveling circuses were very popular, and, slowly but surely, the dogs \"ran off with the circus\" and became circus performers. Barnum and Bailey famously featured Eskies who danced to music alongside clowns! Their brilliantly white coats, perky personalities and remarkable intelligence made the American Eskimo Dog's ancestors born performers.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, America entered World War I, and the German Spitz's name was changed to the American Eskimo Dog due to a nationwide scorn for anything of German origin. (Today, the German Spitz and the Eksie are two separate breeds.) The American Kennel Club registered the American Eskimo Dog in 1995, and the rest (as they say) is history.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to make this pup your companion dog? You can find a list of reputable American Eskimo Dog breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/american-eskimo-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The price for a puppy ranges from $1,200 to $3,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
