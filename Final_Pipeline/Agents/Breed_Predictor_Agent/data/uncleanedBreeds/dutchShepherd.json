Over time, their intelligence and vigilant nature led to their use as police and military dogs, and they've held positions as search and rescue dogs, too.

By the 1940s and 1950s, when modern farming reduced the need for herding sheep, the popularity of the Dutch Shepherd plummeted. During World War II, these dogs almost became extinct.
