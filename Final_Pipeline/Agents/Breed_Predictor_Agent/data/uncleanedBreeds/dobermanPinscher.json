But when the pup parent provides the proper training, socialization and structure, these dogs are also a loving member of the family.\r\n\r\nYou'll soon discover that, along with their formidable presence, Dobermans possess a deep devotion to their people. In fact, they bond so deeply with their humans and are so dedicated to their families, these affectionate dogs are sometimes referred to as \"Velcro dogs.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to their work as guard dogs, Dobermans have a long history as police and military dogs, dating back to the early 20th century. Dobermans even assisted U.S. Marines during World War II.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Caring for a Doberman isn't rocket science, but there is definitely some work involved, as with any dog. While their grooming needs are fairly easy to keep up with, Dobies require a good amount of daily exercise and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-secrets-for-doberman-pinschers\"\u003Elots of training.\u003C/a\u003E With all that training and time spent together, you'll quickly build a tight bond with this super-smart dog.",
        "grooming": "Dobermans are a short-coated dog breed, and this will save you plenty of time when it comes to brushing. (The short coat will also make housework easier, as shedding is minimal.) Nevertheless, brushing is absolutely important and vital to maintaining a shiny, healthy and good-looking coat.\n\nYou should brush your Dobie a couple of times a week, and the sessions don't have to be very long—about 15 minutes (or less) will do the trick. Use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-bristle-brushes_c355_f70v83784\"\u003Esimple bristle brush\u003C/a\u003E to keep the coat clean and free of dandruff. Another excellent grooming tool for short-coated dogs is the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/kong-dog-zoomgroom-multi-use-brush/dp/51528\"\u003EKONG ZoomGroom\u003C/a\u003E, which removes loose hair and improves coat condition.\n\nA complete head-to-toe grooming session will take a bit more time. Like any dog, your Doberman will need to have their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Eteeth brushed\u003C/a\u003E every day and their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enails trimmed\u003C/a\u003E as needed (generally once month will do it). In addition to daily teeth brushing at home, it's a good idea to have your vet professionally clean your pup's teeth once a year. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003EBaths\u003C/a\u003E are only needed occasionally to keep your dog smelling fresh or whenever they get exceptionally dirty from playing outside.\n\nThese grooming sessions not only help your dog feel and look their best but also allow you to look for developing health issues and spend some bonding time together—and we all know Dobermans LOVE quality time with their people.",
        "training": "Don't underestimate the importance of training your Doberman. Solid \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior\"\u003Eobedience training\u003C/a\u003E is essential for any dog, but it's especially important for Dobermans. Remember, these are large, powerful dogs.\n\nA \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/martingale-11541\"\u003Emartingale collar\u003C/a\u003E can be a useful training tool, as it contains two loops that tighten slightly (but not too much!) when the dog pulls. It can help give a pet parent additional control and help the dog learn not to pull on the leash. Dog harnesses are also helpful. If you're having trouble with your dog pulling on the leash during walks, this is a sign your dog may need more training.\n\nIf you're unsure about general obedience training, find a certified dog trainer in your area who uses positive reinforcement. They'll help lay the foundation and aid in molding your Dobie into a happy and well-mannered member of the home.\n\nHappily, Dobermans are very easy to train. They learn quickly and have even been called too smart. They can be sensitive to correction, so again, gentle and positive reinforcement is best. Take advantage of your Doberman's natural intelligence to help guide them toward your goals. Once they understand what's important to you, it will be important to them!",
        "diet_nutrition": "Dobermans need a complete and balanced dog food to ensure they remain at the appropriate weight and receive the proper nutrients. The choice of wet or dry food is really up to you, as long as it's a quality, balanced diet.\n\nAim to feed your Doberman on a set schedule and don't—if possible!—treat with \"human\" foods. That's a toughie, of course, especially when your Doberman gives you the \"I want some, too!\" face. But it's really for the best because those calories do add up. Just make sure you treat with \"dog-safe\" people food. (Find out what human foods aren't safe to feed your dog \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/toxic-foods-for-pets\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.) Luckily, there are plenty of suitable \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/treats-335\"\u003Etreats made specifically for dogs\u003C/a\u003E. Treats are often an important part of training (and used to show your dog you love them), but again, you want to make sure you don't overdo them.\n\nYour vet is a great resource to help you determine the best food, feeding schedule and \"treat times\" for your individual dog based on factors like their age, weight and activity level.",
        "exercise": "Dobermans are highly energetic dogs who require plenty of exercise. Daily walks are essential, so get ready to put on your walking shoes because Dobermans need at least an hour of exercise a day to meet their needs.\n\nIf you're a runner, your Doberman will likely enjoy running with you several times a week. Dobermans have high energy levels, and they'll appreciate the exercise, provided you take it easy at first and build up to the desired activity level. Just like you, your dog needs to become fit for the task. Fun fact: A Doberman's top speed is over 30 miles per hour—much faster than you can run! So, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-go-bike-riding-with-your-dog\"\u003Etaking your dog with you on a bike ride\u003C/a\u003E is a good way to help them really stretch their legs. Occasional off-leash play—in a fenced-in yard or dog park—is good, too. Many Dobermans also enjoy swimming.\n\nIn addition to physical exercise, Dobermans need mental stimulation. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDog puzzles\u003C/a\u003E, games, agility or similar activities will do the trick.",
        "ideal_environment": "Of course, with all that energy, your Doberman would love a nice, large fenced-in yard to run and play, but as long as you're meeting their exercise needs elsewhere, they can handle apartment life. Some might even appreciate time in an appropriately sized dog run.\r\n\r\nThe Doberman's ideal environment is a mixture of indoor and outdoor time. And activities with you are high on their priority list. Outdoor time is necessary for exercise and overall well-being, but they really want to be with their families, so being involved with the day-to-day activities inside the house is very important. Also, Dobermans are naturally lean and don't have the coat length to handle cold weather for long periods and can overheat on hot summer days.",

        "h2_breed_history": "So what is the origin of the Doberman dog? In 19th century Germany, a tax collector named Louis Dobermann decided he needed a dog to be his companion and protector as he went about his duties. He wanted a dog who would be loyal and strong but intimidating too. Over time, he developed the breed now known as the Doberman. (The breed was named for him, but with only one N.) Several breeds are believed to have influenced the \u003Ca href=\"https://dpca.org/breed/breed-history/\"\u003EDoberman's development\u003C/a\u003E, including the English Greyhound, the Black and Tan Manchester Terrier, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/german-shepherd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGerman Shepherd\u003C/a\u003E, the German Pinscher, the Weimaraner and the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/rottweiler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERottweiler\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s, the Doberman breed had arrived in America, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1908. Doberman population growth in the United States was slow in the early years but received a boost thanks to George Howard Earle III, a Doberman enthusiast and politician. (He was later governor of Pennsylvania.) Earle was one of the founders of the \u003Ca href=\"https://dpca.org/\"\u003EDoberman Pinscher Club of America\u003C/a\u003E (DPCA), which was formed in 1921. The breed was admired for their excellent skills and qualities, especially as a protective and loyal guard dog. And the rest, as they say, is (Doberman) history.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s, a random albino mutation gene occurred, and while it resulted in a new color for the breed (white), the albino gene wasn't without its accompanying health issues. The specific gene has since been identified, and breeders can use a simple DNA test to help avoid albinism in Dobermans.\r\n\r\nToday, the Doberman is a popular family dog. Along with 30 other breeds, the Doberman Pinscher is part of the AKC's Working Group classification, which recognizes breeds that have historically performed jobs (search-and-rescue dogs or guard dogs, for example).\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Doberman puppies? You can find a list of reputable Doberman breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/doberman-pinscher\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. What's the average Doberman price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 for a pup. But for that, you usually are getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Doberman Pinscher rescue organizations to adopt a Doberman, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-doberman-pinscher_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",

Of course, every dog is different, and some may not be good with kids, but once a Doberman understands the child is part of the family, they usually shower the child with love and protection. Remember, always supervise your Doberman when interacting with a child.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Dobermans dangerous?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nDobermans are strong, imposing dogs and may seem intimidating, especially to those outside their families, but they aren't considered more or less dangerous than other dog breeds. Like all dog breeds, Dobermans can display unwanted behaviors you'll need to address, but a reputable trainer can help you work through any issues. As noted, Dobermans can display protective tendencies, and they do have a strong bite force.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most common Doberman mixes?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Rottweiler mix (Rotterman)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-German Shepherd mix (Doberman Shepherd)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Beagle mix (Beagleman)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Labrador Retriever mix (Doberdor)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Boxer mix (Boxerman)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Corgi mix (Dobergi or Dorgi)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Golden Retriever mix (Golderman)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Husky mix (Siberian Pinscher or Dobsky)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Great Dane mix (Doberdane)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Poodle mix (Doberdoodle)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EDoberman-Bouvier des Flandres mix (Bouberman)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
