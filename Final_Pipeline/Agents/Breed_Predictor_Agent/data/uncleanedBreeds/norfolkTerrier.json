If you are interested in this procedure, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian.  \u003C/p\u003E",
        "h2_breed_temperament": "The Norfolk Terrier breed is active, intelligent and incredibly scrappy. These little guys are pretty sociable, and they thrive on interaction with the people they love the most. Undoubtedly, they're happiest when they're in the mix of all that's happening in your home.\r\n\r\nThese pups have all the typical terrier characteristics you'd expect: They're curious, independent, willful and fearless. They like to investigate any and all situations—hanging back is simply not their style. Additionally, Norfolk Terriers have strong chasing instincts, and they cannot be trusted off-leash. If given the opportunity, they will chase rodents, squirrels, rabbits and other small creatures.\r\n\r\nNorfolk Terrier dogs are quite affectionate and loyal to their families. They will not fail to sound the alarm if they sense something is amiss. But, while they will call for backup, they're small and pretty docile, so handling the situation will largely be up to you. (Think of them as alarm dogs, not guard dogs.) While not incredibly wary of strangers, they can be reserved around newcomers.\r\n\r\nThis breed typically does well in families, but there are some things new pet parents should keep in mind. Norfolk Terriers can be intolerant of the boundary issues that typically come with little humans. Additionally, their small size can be cause for concern. Small kids are far more likely to handle them roughly or step on them. For these reasons, it's essential to teach any children in your dog's life how to respectfully and gently interact with dogs, and supervising young children around your pup is recommended. These pups can also be great with other dogs but may chase cats or other small pets.\r\n\r\nNorfolk Terriers have a high energy level, and they hate being bored or left alone. They're also clever enough to entertain themselves, and you may not like their hacks to cure boredom: Norfolk Terriers are notorious for digging and chewing. Keep them well-exercised and mentally stimulated to avoid them developing a habit of destructive behaviors.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Norfolk Terriers are high on energy, but their grooming needs are relatively low. A good brushing once a week and hand stripping twice a year are enough. And though these pups are all action, all the time, they don't have lofty exercise needs; like most dogs, a daily walk is plenty. Norfolk Terriers love to be in the mix with their families and don't take too kindly to being left alone. While early socialization is important, they also tend to make great family pets.",
        "grooming": "Norfolk Terriers have a double coat that consists of a soft and fluffy undercoat, and a hard, wiry overcoat. It's moderately easy to maintain. These pups don't need a regular haircut, as clipping will soften and lighten the coat and remove its natural waterproofing. But at least twice a year, in the fall and spring, Norfolk Terriers \"blow their coat\" (a fancy way for saying they shed in clumps) and will need to be hand stripped (when you rake through the coat with your hands or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/s?query=hand%20stripping%20tools&amp;nav-submit-button=\"\u003Estripping tool\u003C/a\u003E to get rid of loose, dead hair). If you don't feel up to the task, a groomer can take care of this for you. As a bonus, a hand-stripped coat sheds dirt and is water-resistant, which means fewer \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Ebaths\u003C/a\u003E for your pup. Generally, baths for this dog should be infrequent (think: once every three months) as they can easily dry out their skin.\n\nNorfolk Terriers should be brushed at least once a week with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-bristle-brushes_c355_f70v83784\"\u003Ebristle brush\u003C/a\u003E to remove loose hair and dirt. While you're at it, check their ears for debris (dirt or wax buildup), redness or swelling, and alert your veterinarian if you see anything unusual. They may recommend \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Ecleaning their ears\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nNorfolk Terrier dogs are prone to dental issues; tartar build-up on the teeth can progress to an infection of the gums and roots of the teeth. To keep them healthy, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Eregular toothbrushing\u003C/a\u003E is recommended. Veterinarians strongly recommend you brush your dog's teeth every day. If your dog joins the family as a puppy, you may want to get them used to the feel of toothbrushing as you're raising your Norfolk Terrier. Doing so will make it far easier as they grow into adulthood. If you're still not comfortable brushing your dog's teeth, your vet can show you how. You should also plan to have your dog's teeth professionally cleaned by your vet at least once a year.\n\nIn addition to regular brushing and good oral hygiene, pet parents should monitor their dog's nails. They'll probably need a trim about once a month. If you can hear their nails tapping on the floor, it's \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etime for a trim\u003C/a\u003E!",
        "training": "Norfolk Terriers are exceptionally bright, so they're pretty easy to train. On the whole, new parents will find these pups are eager to learn new commands and fun tricks. But they can also be pretty obstinate, particularly during potty training. Sometimes small dogs are just harder to train; they have small bladders and need to go out more frequently, and their \"must-potty-now\" cues aren't as obvious as, say, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/great-dane/\"\u003EGreat Dane's\u003C/a\u003E. Consistency is the key. Be sure to take your pup out about 20 minutes after every meal and reward them when they potty outside. (Be sure to use the same cue words, like \"Let's go potty,\" so they start to learn what it means.)\n\nLike most dogs, positive reinforcement, or offering rewards for good behavior, works well for a Norfolk Terrier puppy. Incentives like treats, praise and play breaks with fun toys will offer the best results. That training will come in handy when dealing with traits that may test your patience, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\"\u003Ebarking\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-to-stop-dogs-from-digging\"\u003Edigging\u003C/a\u003E and giving chase to smaller animals—all classic Norfolk Terrier behavior. Managing these issues can be a challenge, to say the least. For that reason, early \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E (aka exposure to new people, places and things) and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience training\u003C/a\u003E (basic skills like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E) are crucial. Socialization will help your dog stay calm (and quiet) in the face of new experiences, and obedience skills will help you redirect their undesirable behavior when necessary. You will never completely train these traits out of your dog, but you can help curb it.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Norfolk Terriers don't have any breed-specific nutritional requirements, and they'll do quite well with most types of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Bear in mind, however, that throughout your dog's life, their food should be complete and balanced, as well as appropriate to their age (puppy, adult, senior), activity level and overall health.\r\n\r\nPet parents of Norfolk Terriers should keep in mind that these pups are voracious eaters; they love their food and are unfortunately prone to obesity. So not only is it important to watch their calorie intake, but it's also important to remember that, while treats make everyone happy, they can be high in calories too. Obesity can lead to health problems down the road, like osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and diabetes.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure what type of diet is best for your dog or you're concerned about their weight, always consult your veterinarian. They are your greatest resource to help you pick the best food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Norfolk Terriers are energetic, but when it comes to exercise, they're surprisingly low-maintenance. A brisk 30-minute walk every day should be plenty.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, these pups are extremely playful, so their exercise doesn't have to be a boring chore. Running and walking are great, but you can also play fetch and tug-of-war to give them the exercise they need. Remember that mental stimulation counts, too, so if the weather isn't cooperating, you can always try \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\"\u003Edog puzzles\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nTake great care to keep your pup on a leash when you're out and about—always. Norfolk Terriers have an incredibly high prey drive, so they're essentially guaranteed to give chase if something interesting walks by—and without a leash, you won't be able to keep them by your side and out of harm's way.",
        "ideal_environment": "Norfolk Terriers are small dogs, so they can do quite well in apartments, provided you're able to give them the exercise they need. And if you've got kids, all the better—though you'll have to supervise younger children closely, to prevent them from playing too roughly with your small pup. These dogs are incredibly affectionate with their families, and they tend to do well with other dogs. Cats and smaller pets like ferrets and hamsters, however, may be a different story—Norfolk Terriers are prone to view them as prey that needs chasing.\n\nThese little guys love to mix and mingle, and they're happiest when they're included in the fun. They like adventures just as much as you do, so if you're headed out for the weekend, they'll likely jump at the chance to ride shotgun. If you take off on an adventure without them, they have no qualms expressing their annoyance, typically in the form of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-tips-how-to-stop-destructive-chewing-in-dogs\"\u003Echewing\u003C/a\u003E.

The history of the Norfolk Terrier began in the early 1800s in the county of East Anglia in England. Believed to be a cross between \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/border-terrier/\"\u003EBorder Terriers\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECairn Terriers\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/irish-terrier/\"\u003EIrish Terriers\u003C/a\u003E, these dogs were intended to be farm dogs and hunters.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Terrier was first classified in the Terrier group with its close cousin, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/norwich-terrier/\"\u003ENorwich Terrier\u003C/a\u003E, as one breed. And understandably so—aside from their ears (the Norwich Terrier has pricked ears, and the Norfolk Terrier has dropped ears), the breeds are quite similar. In 1979, the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were finally recognized as separate breeds by the American Kennel Club.\r\n\r\nStanding at only 10 inches, these pups are the smallest of the Terrier group. They are brave and sturdy and, considering they were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin in barns, they can easily pick up plenty of speed when they're on the chase. In fact, they were so good at their job, they affectionately became known as “a demon in the field.\"\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Norfolk Terriers are one of the few breeds who are allowed to have \"honor scars\" (from wear and tear) in the show ring as a testament to their courage and scrappiness. The superior intelligence and affable personality of the Norfolk Terrier has made them a highly sought-after companion dog. These pups have a lot of personality, and they're always fun to be around.\r\n\r\nToday, Norfolk Terriers are becoming harder to find as breeders are aging out, and few new breeders join the ranks. But you can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/norfolk-terrier\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E; just be prepared to wait. A Norfolk Terrier puppy will cost around $2,500 to $3,500. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
