Naturally curious by nature, these pups are known for their devotion and ability to entertain their families—they love chasing toys and zooming around when they have an audience.\n\nManchester Terriers are not generally aggressive (unless you're a rodent), and the pups aren't known to be biters. However, these highly intelligent and observant watchdogs are known to be barkers, so you'll always know what's coming down your street.\n\nManchesters do fine with kids as long as they're properly \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialized\u003C/a\u003E, but they may need considerable training to live with with other dogs or cats unless they've been raised with them since they were puppies. And you can forget about \"pocket\" pets like gerbils or rabbits. These pups were born for hunting rats, and they are likely to chase these types of pets.\n\nThey can be wary around strangers, but with socialization from puppyhood, they can learn to be OK when new people come around. But they will always let you know when someone's at your door!\n\nThis playful pup enjoys games and will attack squeaky toys and chase balls with abandon. But&nbsp;Manchesters also enjoy physical closeness and companionship, so they're always ready for snuggles. Therefore, they may not like being left alone all day. If you're not able to be with them for most of the day, check them into doggie daycare or arrange for a pet sitter or neighbor to come by for a play date.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Manchester Terriers need a moderate amount of care. Thankfully, their smooth, glossy coats are a snap to maintain.

The Manchester Terrier's coat almost always appears sleek, silky, smooth and pulled together.\n\nTo maintain their coat, brush it every week with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-curry-brushes_c355_f70v83786\"\u003Ecurry brush\u003C/a\u003E to remove any shedding and keep their coats shiny. They do blow their coat in the spring and fall, so you'll probably need to brush them every day during those particular seasons to keep up with all that hair. (A dog who blows their coat sheds it in chunks instead of lots of individual hairs.) While you're brushing their coat, check their ears for debris, redness or swelling. If you notice anything unusual, contact your vet, who may recommend you \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean their ears\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nThese pups only need an occasional bath (about every two to three months) unless your Manchester plays in the mud. Some Manchesters really enjoy bathtime—they get \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E your attention. So make that a special time to lavish your love on your pup.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003EBrush their teeth\u003C/a\u003E daily. It's best to start when the dogs are puppies, so they'll get used to brushing early on. Clean teeth are important for all dogs to avoid a build-up of bacteria, decay or cavities.

Like all dogs, Manchesters respond well to positive reinforcement (using praise, treats and lots of play breaks as rewards for jobs well done.) These pups are eager to learn, but they may try to outwit you at times. Manchester Terriers aren't the easiest dogs for first-time pet parents to train, but if you're willing to be consistent and patient, they may be a good fit for you.\n\nManchesters are slow to warm up to new people and other dogs and aren't as naturally friendly as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\"\u003EGolden Retrievers\u003C/a\u003E. So, it's important to start socializing your dog while they're a puppy to get them used to new situations. Puppy school is great for this. They get to learn how to play with other puppies, and they get to meet new people all in one location! (Win, win!)",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Manchester Terrier typically does well on a complete and balanced diet of high-quality dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Your veterinarian can help you figure out how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nThis breed does have a tendency to gain weight easily if they aren't getting enough exercise. So, don't forget to count the treats you give your pup. If you see your pup gaining weight, contact your vet. They are in the best position to help you choose the right mealtime and exercise plan for your dog to help shed the weight and maintain their nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "Energetic and curious, Manchester Terriers need a lot of exercise to satisfy their athletic tendencies so plan on providing at least an hour of activity each day.\n\nWalks are always a good way to give your pup time to explore the world, but as they also love to work up to some speed, engage them in a fast-paced game of backyard fetch. Once bred for coursing and hunting, these muscular dogs tend to be strong and somewhat fearless, making them excellent performance dogs on agility circuits and at other dog sports, like rally (similar to obedience) or even Fast CAT (where dogs chase a lure in a 100-yard dash).\n\nIt's always good to remember, especially with a Manchester, that tired dogs tend to be well-behaved dogs. If you don't deplete your pup's energy every day, they'll find ways to entertain themselves: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-to-stop-dogs-from-digging\"\u003Edigging\u003C/a\u003E, barking, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/training-tips-how-to-stop-destructive-chewing-in-dogs\"\u003Edestroying things around the home\u003C/a\u003E or looking for ways to escape! And, while you want to attend to their physical needs, be sure to engage their minds as well. Manchesters love playing with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/s?query=dog%20squeak%20toys&amp;nav-submit-button=\"\u003Esqueaky toys&nbsp;\u003C/a\u003Ethat engage their rodent-hunting instincts, and, deep thinkers that they are, also enjoy \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\"\u003Epuzzle toys. \u003C/a\u003E\n\nWhen taking your pup outside a fenced area, remember that the Manchester Terrier loves to chase critters. It's important your pup is well-trained, but it's equally important to remember that you can never fully train those terrier traits out of your pup. If they find something to chase, they will chase it, regardless of what's happening around them or how loudly you call. For your sanity and their safety, always keep them on a leash when you're not in a fenced area.",
        "ideal_environment": "Manchester Terriers are high-energy pups looking for high-energy pet parents. They can do well with first-timers, as long as you're able to be consistent with your training and exercise routine throughout their life.\r\n\r\nThese pups love being with you and don't enjoy being left alone, so it may be best if someone's home with them for most of the day.\r\n\r\nThey do well with kids as long as they're properly socialized and the kids in their life are taught to interact respectfully with dogs. Manchesters may do OK with other dogs and cats if they grow up together. However, some pets, like rabbits, will likely raise the pup's instinct to chase, and that may make for a stressful home.\r\n\r\nTheir small size makes them ideal for apartment dwellers—just be sure you are able to give them the exercise they need every day.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Manchester Terrier breed origins can be traced back to the late 1570s and their ancestors, the Black and Tan Terrier. In the early 1800s, a breeder named John Hulme from Manchester, England, crossed the Black and Tan Terrier with the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/whippet/\"\u003EWhippet\u003C/a\u003E to get the sleek Manchester Terrier, who were proficient rodent killers, vermin hunters and course-game dogs (dogs who chased lures around a track).\r\n\r\nThe breed's popularity soared in the Victorian era. Men in Victorian England prized this breed as a gentleman's dog for their sleek looks and ratting prowess. (Rats were a big problem at the time, so naturally, a dog who excelled at rat killing was prized.) However, Victorian women preferred a smaller dog, so the toy version of the pup was developed. The only difference between the two types (standard and toy) are their size and their ears: the standard can have naturally erect, folded or cropped ears, and the toy only has naturally erect ears.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club first recognized the Toy Manchester Terrier in 1886 and the Standard Manchester Terrier in 1887. But in 1959, the two types were put together in one breed, the Manchester Terrier. (Naturally, the standard is in the Terrier group and the the toy is in the Toy group.)\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find a Manchester Terrier puppy today?

In terms of cost, expect to spend about $600 to $1,000 for a Manchester Terrier puppy, depending on the breeder.
