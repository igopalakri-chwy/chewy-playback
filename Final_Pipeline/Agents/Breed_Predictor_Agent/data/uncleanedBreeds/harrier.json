Even though these dogs are very friendly, getting them used to meeting new people and other dogs while they're young is vital to help bring out their outgoing personalities. Take them on lots of leashed walks and let them meet and sniff new friends, both two- and four-legged. Enroll them in puppy school, where they learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people in one location.\u003C/span\u003E",
        "diet_nutrition": "Harriers do well on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior), and look for the statement on the package that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nHarriers will eat an entire bowl of any dog food in five minutes and want more, which can lead to obesity and health problems like heart disease and diabetes that come with it. It's essential to have food bowls out only at mealtimes and not allow them to graze all day. Your veterinarian can help you determine how much and how often to feed your Harrier.\r\n\r\nAvoid feeding them table scraps, cooked bones and high-fat foods, as these can lead to obesity and other health problems. Harriers might enjoy \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/medium-dog-chew-toys_c316_f6v13791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Echew toys\u003C/a\u003E to gnaw on between meals instead.

But the exercise commitment is quite a bit more extensive than, say, the commitment of a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/beagle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBeagle\u003C/a\u003E. This breed has high exercise needs—plan for 60 to 90 minutes daily. Afterward, though, these dogs do settle down well for a little Netflix binge on the couch.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nonstop marathon training, Harriers make great hiking companions and will enjoy long walks where they can explore with their noses (this is a great way to exercise their minds, too). They also like retrieving games, like throwing the ball and letting your dog hunt for it. Mental as well as physical workouts create happy, healthy and well-behaved Harriers.\r\n\r\nDo you like a bit of competition? Your Harrier will, too. These pups excel at dog sports, like agility, tracking and coursing (where they chase a lure around a track). Your pup gets their wiggles out, and you may come home with some snazzy first-place ribbons!\r\n\r\nHarriers have many positive traits, but boredom is definitely something you want to avoid. Harriers will plot mischief or an escape route if they don't get enough mental exercise, so load up on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/fetch-toys-317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efetch toys\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E to keep them challenged.\r\n\r\nRemember that Harriers are hunters led by their noses. Your yard must be securely fenced; otherwise, they'll put their nose down and disappear! They can be quite the Houdini when on a scent, so keeping them on a leash when out and about is essential. If they catch a scent, these speedy dogs are off on the chase—and all your training will feel like it's gone out the window. So, for your sanity and their safety, always keep them on a leash when you're out and about.",
        "ideal_environment": "Harriers love to have company, and they're good with families. Because working in teams is in their genes, they do better when they're not alone. So, if it's just you and your Harrier, you may want to add another dog to the home. While they love a social scene, watching Harriers around small children is always a good idea. Be especially careful with small pets that your Harrier might mistake for critters that need chasing, like cats and rodents.\r\n\r\nHarriers thrive in active homes and can really make the most of an expansive, securely fenced-in yard. They may be less suited for apartment living, but if you have regular access to a dog-friendly outdoor area where they can exercise, it can be done. In addition to needing lots of company and room to roam, Harriers can be vocal (and some love to howl). They make great neighbors in suburban homes, and they love the country.",

        "h2_breed_history": "\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EWhile there are many unconfirmed tales about the history of this breed, there are a few Harrier dog facts we know for sure. Harriers were initially bred for hunting hares—get it, \"Harrier\"? The first packs appear to have originated in medieval England sometime in the 1200s. Sir Elias de Midhope, a resident of Yorkshire, England, is believed to have developed the first Harrier. His Harrier packs were originally called Penistone Harriers or the Penistone Pack. Detailed records of individual Harrier packs have been recorded in England from 1260 to today.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EHarriers have been in America since colonial times. Some say Virginians, perhaps even George Washington, used Harriers to develop American hounds. They appealed to literary types too, and in 1735, English poet William Somervile published a poem called \"The Chase\" that described a Harrier dog.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EThe American Kennel Club recognized the Harrier breed in 1885. One of the AKC's rarest breeds, the Harrier is considered rarer than the panda, with only about 949 Harriers registered with the AKC from 1884 to 1994. The good news is that their rareness may promote healthy genetics, which means the Harrier may have fewer health complications than other breeds.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003ESo, where is the best place to find a Harrier puppy today? You can find a list of reputable Harrier breeders on the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/harrier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003E. Depending on the breeder, expect the cost of your Harrier puppy to be anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000. You usually get a Harrier screened for health and temperament issues for that price, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Harrier rescue organizations to adopt a Harrier.\u003C/span\u003E",
