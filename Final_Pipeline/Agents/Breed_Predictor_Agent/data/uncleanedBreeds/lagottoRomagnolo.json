They get along well with other dogs and kids as long as they have been socialized from a young age.\r\n\r\nLagotti aren't typically excessive barkers, but they will let you know when the mail arrives or when someone's at the door, so prepare your guests for a noisy welcome. On the other paw, they can be a little aloof with strangers or get anxious in unfamiliar situations, so start their socialization early by introducing them to new people and places like the park and family gatherings. And teach kids how to interact with dogs. Doing so will help prepare Lagotti for the new situations and unfamiliar faces they will meet on their many adventures with you.\r\n\r\nThis sensitive dog breed will be very in-tune with their beloved pet parents' feelings. If you are having an off day, they may well have one too, so take time for a cuddle to cheer you both up. The Lagotto Romagnolo is definitely a pet parent pleaser, so lavish them with love and cuddles and praise them eagerly when they do well in training sessions or dog sports. And you'll always have company, because this breed is a \"velcro dog\" type who'll be stuck to your side day and night.\r\n\r\nBred to be truffle hunters, the Lagotti breed rarely runs out of steam.

You don't have to keep your training sessions short, since these dogs don't tire easily. But you do want to stop and take a break, and maybe a walk, before either of you get too frustrated. Lagotti typically do well \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Eon a leash\u003C/a\u003E and aren't likely to bark without good reason.\n\nOne behavioral trait to watch out for with your Lagotto Romagnolo is digging. Since these dogs were born to dig up truffles, digging is innate, and discouraging this behavior can be a challenge. The solution? Redirect their attention to a beloved toy—or better yet, give them their own sandbox! They'll happily spend hours digging for hidden toys in the sand.\n\nHowever you vary your training, remember that the Lagotto dog breed responds best to positive reinforcement, so line up the words of praise and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etraining treats\u003C/a\u003E (within reason) to guarantee a successful, fun and bonding experience for both of you.",
        "diet_nutrition": "A complete and balanced diet is essential for your Lagotto Romagnolo. Look for a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E formulated for breeds that respond well to whole grains, like brown rice and oats. An option with single meat proteins and limited ingredients can be a good choice—but always check with your vet to make sure you're picking the best product for your dog's unique needs.\r\n\r\nLimit \"people food,\" like meat, veggies and cheese to less than 10 percent of your pup's daily food intake. The majority of your Lagotto Romagnolo's nutrition should come from commercial dog food formulated to provide all the vitamins and nutrients they need. Some adult dogs are happy with one meal a day, while others prefer two light meals, so base your feeding schedule on a combination of your Lagotto Romagnolo's personal preference and your vet's expert advice.",
        "exercise": "Take a second to imagine how much work must go into searching acres of forest for tiny fungi hidden underground. The Lagotto Romagnolo can work at hunting truffles all day long with just a few breaks—which should give you a pretty good idea of their level of stamina. These dogs crave activity and need vigorous exercise for up to 60 minutes each day to be happy.

Mental stimulation. A dog who's bred to use their sense of smell to track precious truffles won't be satisfied vegging on the couch every day. Play games with your Lagotto Romagnolo that engage their brains and entertain them, like \"find the treat\" or hide and seek, and teach them fun tricks, like play dead or shake. Activities like these will keep your dog occupied and out of trouble (and hopefully stop them from going on a truffle hunt in your flowerbeds). When you're occupied, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys and games\u003C/a\u003E will also exercise their minds.",
        "ideal_environment": "One of the most important things to know about the Lagotto breed is that they usually prefer people over other dogs. While that doesn't mean they'd be miserable in a home with other pets, these dogs often prefer to be the focus of their parent's attention. For this reason, they tend to do well in homes with kids as long as they were introduced at a young age. The more people around to shower these dogs with affection, the better. By the same token, this breed isn't ideal for a home that sits empty all day. Loving, loyal Lagotti yearn for human companionship.\r\n\r\nWhile it's best if they have space to speed around, including a fenced yard in which to sniff around, they can make do with an apartment if they get lots of walks and playtime outdoors. Just be mindful that they are diggers and will be prone to tearing up your garden on the hunt for elusive truffles if you don't keep a close eye on them.\r\n\r\nBecause they love water so much—remember, these are Italian water dogs—a house with a pond or a pool, or near a large body of water, would be a Lagotto Romagnolo's dream come true. If this doesn't describe your home, you can always bring them in the shower with you or start planning more beach vacations!",

        "h2_breed_history": "Michelangelo's David and the Mona Lisa weren't the only good things to come out of Renaissance Italy. The Lagotto Romagnolo may not be quite as famous, but they were definitely highly valued in their time—and still are today.\r\n\r\nThis dog's origin can be traced to the marshy lagoons around Northern Italy's Ravenna in the region of Emilia-Romagna, where they recovered waterfowl for hunters. This water retriever is believed to date back to around 1474 A.D. When the area was developed and their bird-hunting days came to an end, the Lagotto Romagnolo's phenomenal nose was put to use hunting truffles, a rare delicacy even then.\r\n\r\nWhile the Lagotto Romagnolo isn't the only dog who can hunt truffles, they were first bred for this purpose and are still considered to be the best for the job. In fact, they're the only purebred dog with this distinction. The Lagotto Romagnolo breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2015.\r\n\r\nLagotto Romagnolo dogs generally cost $1,800-$2,500, and you'll find \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/lagotto-romagnolo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ereputable breeders\u003C/a\u003E offering puppies across the United States. For that price, you'll typically get a dog who has been screened for potential health and behavioral issues and may even come with papers. You might be waiting for some time for a pup, though, as they are rare.
