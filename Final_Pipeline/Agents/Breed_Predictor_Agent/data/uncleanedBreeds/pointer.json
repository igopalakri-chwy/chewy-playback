Intelligent and fun-loving, Pointers are confident, don't take things personally (they're OK that you think their dance moves might need some work), and enjoy the company of both people, including kids and babies and other dogs.\n\nPointers are not usually fearful or anxious in nature, so aggression and dog bites are typically uncommon as they are very friendly dogs—especially with proper training and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E.

Pointers are hard workers who work through challenges and don't give up on things easily, but sometimes what they work hard at is what they find to be most important in that moment, whether it's chasing a squirrel, pulling you down the street or jumping to greet people at the door. Pointers were originally bred to point out prey (usually hares) for the hounds to chase down and retrieve.

Not only does this make training even more difficult, it can create a dog who is reactive and/or nervous.

While a rural or suburban setting with a yard is ideal, they can handle city life as long as you can put in the effort to meet their exercise needs.

The Pointer found and pointed at the prey, then the hounds chased it down. With the rise of wing shooting in the 18th century, they became trained as bird dogs. Their hunting instincts tend to kick in around two months of age.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that Pointers are a very distractible dog, which doesn't sound ideal for their purpose. But that's actually what makes them amazing hunting dogs—they give up a smell to follow movement, then pick up that same smell until they find their target and \u003Cem\u003Epoint\u003C/em\u003E it out.\r\n\r\nPointers were one of the first breeds registered in America in 1878. When the American Kennel Club was founded in 1884, Pointers were one of the first nine breeds to be recognized by the organization.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Pointer puppy as a pet to your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/pointer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. It's recommended to work with a reputable breeder because that usually means you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health issues and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Pointer price can range $700-$1,000. Prospective pet parents can also adopt from Pointer rescue groups around the country, or you can keep your eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
