These fun-loving pups get along well with kids, other dogs, and even cats, provided they're properly socialized when they're puppies. As a herding breed, your Corgi may try to herd your kids and nip at their heels, so remember to supervise playtimes with kids and your pup.\r\n\r\nTheir energy levels fall somewhere in between couch potato and triathlete. Cardis are just as happy to snuggle with you on the couch as they are to play outside all day—just as long as their family keeps them company. These smart dogs need variety in their training and exercise routine to keep them from getting bored and deciding your shoes make great chew toys.\r\n\r\nCardigans may take a while to warm up to visitors. Introducing them to new people when they're puppies will help them warm up quickly to new friends as they grow up. And because these pups are big barkers, they'll let you know whenever someone comes to the door.",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "Cardigan Welsh Corgis are relatively high maintenance. These good-humored charmers need a varied daily exercise routine, regular grooming and a lot of mental stimulation. A well-kept Cardi is a happy dog who will reward you with love and loyalty.",
        "grooming": "Cardigan Welsh Corgis are double-coated with a thick and fluffy undercoat and smooth yet coarse outer coat that is surprisingly easy to maintain with consistent brushing. Although they are shedders, a good, once-a-week brushing, ideally with a top-quality \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/slicker-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83792\"\u003Eslicker brush\u003C/a\u003E, will keep them looking healthy and clean. And they will shed more heavily in the spring and fall when they blow their coat. (They shed their coat in chunks of fur instead of many individual hairs.)\n\nCardigan coats also help regulate their body temperature, so haircuts should be kept to a minimum—except around the back of their legs and feet, where dirt tends to collect. While Cardigan Welsh Corgi grooming needs are relatively the same year-round, black-colored Cardis may need trims more regularly than their lighter-toned counterparts to avoid overheating during the warm summer months.\n\nDepending on how much time your Cardigan spends outdoors, their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Enails should be trimmed\u003C/a\u003E at least every couple of weeks. When you hear them clicking on hard surfaces, you'll know it's time for a trim. If you live near large, green spaces, you might need to bath them more often than that but don't worry, little Cardis love to swim, indoors or out.\n\nSmall dogs like Cardigans are more likely to get a dental disease than big dogs, so dental hygiene is extra important. Get crafty with toothpaste flavors and teeth-cleaning treats, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003Edaily brushings\u003C/a\u003E and annual vet cleaning to keep your Cardigan looking and feeling their best.",
        "training": "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi breed is so intelligent and eager to please that training them is a walk in the park. But, great attitude aside, they need consistent incentives and exposure to many scenarios to remain well-behaved.\r\n\r\nWith the right motivation and positive reinforcement, training, preferably in fun games where the whole family participates, will teach your Cardigan Welsh Corgi puppy to sit, fetch and roll over—any trick you can think of short of making dinner.\r\n\r\nOf course, success depends on your dog's unique personality as some habits, such as excessive barking (a Cardigan specialty!), are hard to break even after months of trying. If all else fails, invest in a qualified trainer or behaviorist. Your Cardi, your ears and your neighbors will be glad you did.\r\n\r\nMake sure your Cardigan Welsh Corgi puppy is well-socialized, starting when they're young to bring out their friendly nature. Take them on walks and let them meet and sniff new two- and four-legged friends. Enroll them in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people.",
        "diet_nutrition": "A healthy Cardigan Welsh Corgi diet consists of high-quality commercial dog food. Before buying, be sure to factor in your dog's age, lifestyle and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior) to pick the best dog food for them.\r\n\r\nCardigans are pickier eaters than their cousins, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/\"\u003EPembroke Welsh Corgis\u003C/a\u003E, and may require higher percentages of protein, especially if not neutered or spayed. In addition, active dogs also need higher rates of fat in their dog food to avoid health issues in the future.\r\n\r\nKeep treats to a minimum, as their weight seems to skyrocket just by smelling them. Since Cardis resemble a loaf of bread with legs, it may be hard to notice if they've put on weight. So the rule of thumb is: If you can't feel their ribs or see a hint of waistline, it's time to cut back on their food.\r\n\r\nTo keep your dog in top form, consult with your veterinarian on a diet specific to your Cardigan Welsh Corgi. After all, they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their needs.",
        "exercise": "Cardigans are highly adaptable to many lifestyles, but they need mental and physical stimulation to keep them healthy and out of trouble. Plan on about 45 minutes of exercise throughout the day. This is great if you enjoy taking long hikes in the hills or strolls on the beach. Cardis also enjoy snuggling up with you whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCardis love to exercise outdoors and excel in dog sports, including herding, rally and tracking, but they love being with their family more, so if you're not active, neither are they.\r\n\r\nIf time is limited, a great compromise is playing a rousing round of fetch in the yard or walking around town while running errands—new sights, smells and sounds add to their socialization training.",
        "ideal_environment": "Raising Cardigan Welsh Corgis with kids and cats is a great idea, provided your Cardigan is socialized and enjoys such company. They also get along with most dogs and happily share their home and toys with a canine playmate.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, their versatile nature allows them to live in both urban and country environments. However, if they could choose, they'd prefer to live out their days on the farm where you'll likely find your Cardigan running and digging (arguably their favorite pastime) to their little heart's content.\r\n\r\nCardigans can be great companions for just about anyone with proper training, although they are best suited for good-humored pet parents prepared to take on a Cardi's quirks.",

        "h2_breed_history": "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi's history dates back to medieval times. As the oldest of two Corgi dog breeds and one of the oldest breeds in Britain, Cardigans are believed to have originated in 1200 B.C. when the Celts migrated with them from central Europe to Wales in the British Isles. Their name comes from the ancient kingdom of Cardiganshire and is a variation of the Celtic word for \"dog.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout their long history, Cardigans have been excellent herding dogs due to their small stature and agility, protective traits, and ability to nip at the heels of cattle. Nowadays, these little doggies spend their time running around, protecting their family from the dreaded mailman and, if they failed obedience school, nipping at the heels of children.\r\n\r\nDespite their differences, in Britain, Cardigans and Pembrokes, the favorite pup of Queen Elizabeth II, were considered a single breed until 1934. However, the first pair of Cardigans arrived in the U.S. in the early 1930s, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized them as a breed in 1935.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find the Cardigan Welsh Corgi dog breed today? You can find a list of reputable breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cardigan-welsh-corgi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E.
