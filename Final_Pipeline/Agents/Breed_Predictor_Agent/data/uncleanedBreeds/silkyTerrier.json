But they do have that traditional \"terrier temperament,\" which is feisty and bold. These traits endear them to their families, but without proper training and exercise, their boldness and feistiness may look a lot like stubbornness and attitude.\n\nWith proper \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocialization\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Etraining\u003C/a\u003E, these pups do well with kids and other dogs. This breed isn't known for being aggressive or biters, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened. So, it's a good idea to supervise them around small kids and babies (a Silky may misread a toddler's quick movements, squeezy hugs and squeals and try to protect themselves). It's also important to ensure children are taught how to properly interact with dogs.\n\nIt might surprise you, but Silkies have a high-prey drive. These dogs are born hunters and were bred to hunt vermin (mostly rats and snakes). So, they'll chase cats and other small animals. But a pup who's had a full day of exercise and play is just too tired to chase the neighbor's cat out of your backyard.\n\nSilkies are known for their barking skills. If it was an Olympic sport, Silkies would take home the gold every time. This trait makes them excellent watchdogs. But know that, while you can \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\"\u003Eteach them to bark less often\u003C/a\u003E, you'll never train the bark completely out of them.\n\nSilky Terrier dogs are very intelligent, so be sure to engage their brains as well as their bodies. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/interactive-toys-319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EInteractive toys\u003C/a\u003E and dog sports like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E are great ways to keep their active minds busy and out of trouble.",

This small dog breed has a lot of energy, but because they're tiny, it doesn't take much to wear them out. And they love pleasing their people, and they take quickly to training—you'll just have to navigate that stubborn streak common to pups like the Silky.",

But the price for a dog who sheds hardly at all is made up in the amount of time you'll be spending brushing their long, flowing hair.

One day soon, they'll enjoy a spa day just as much as you do.",
        "training": "Silky Terriers are smart, independent dogs; and training is just as important for them as it is for a big dog, like an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd/\"\u003EAustralian Shepherd\u003C/a\u003E. Silkies are cute and will charm you with their good looks and spunky personalities, but don't let them charm you into keeping bad habits. Rude is rude no matter how adorable you are.\n\nSilkies learn quickly—they want to please you, and they'll do just about anything for a treat—so you may find your pup quickly picks up the basics like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E.

These techniques, called positive reinforcement, use lots of praise, treats and playtime breaks with special toys to reward your dog for a job well done.\n\nYour Silky Terrier puppy needs to be socialized from an early age, and puppy preschool is a great place to start. These preschools are ideal for puppies to learn how to play with each other and get used to being around adults. This will go a long way to help your pup be cool with new situations, people and dogs as they grow up.\n\nSilkies are yappy. They'll bark at you when they want to play, they'll bark when they're bored, they'll bark when they're mad, and they'll bark at everyone who passes by. You will not be able to train the bark out of your dog—it's in their DNA! (They often burrowed underground to find their quarry, and their bark told their people where to find them.) But you can teach your pup to be quiet after a short barking sesh. (They've just gotta get it out, man.)",
        "diet_nutrition": "Silky Terrier dogs need a complete and balanced diet and often do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Look for the statement on the package that says it meets the nutritional standards of the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aafco.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAssociation of American Feed Control Officials\u003C/a\u003E (AAFCO) and be sure the formula matches your dog's stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) and activity level.\r\n\r\nSilkies are small dogs, so even an extra pound will make a big difference in your pup's overall health. And don't forget to count those treats! You'll be doling them out left and right for all their tricks and just because you love them, but treats can pack on the pounds, too. Your vet can help you determine a good portion size and mealtime schedule for your dog. If you do notice your pup gaining extra weight, talk with your vet. They can help you put together a diet and exercise plan to help shed the weight and maintain your dog's nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "Silky Terriers may look like sweet little lapdogs, but that's only after a day of play. And even though they're small, they need a lot of daily exercise—at least an hour, maybe two.\n\nSilkies love to use their noses (they're born hunters), so walks with the opportunity to smell all the things will work both their brains and their bodies.\n\nDo you like to jog? Guess what? So does your Silky (they're surprisingly speedy)! But because they like to chase things, Silkies should never be allowed off-leash. They're focused little hunters, and they won't hear you call until they've ended the chase. Leashes also are a good way to keep your pup safe from birds of prey like falcons or owls. Silkies are small enough that one of these large birds may mistake your pet for dinner, and keeping your pup on a leash when out in open fields may help keep them safe.\n\nJust be sure to attach that leash to a harness to protect their delicate necks. (Silkies will jerk if they see something they'd love to chase.)\n\nIf you're looking for a few out-of-the-box ideas, your pet will enjoy \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/ready-to-hit-the-hiking-trail-with-your-dog-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\"\u003Ehiking\u003C/a\u003E and swimming.

        "ideal_environment": "The Silky Terrier breed is great for active single people or families, although they're better suited for families with older children. Toddlers and babies don't often know their own strength and could hurt this petite pup, or the dog could misinterpret a toddler's actions and try to defend themselves. So, not only is it important to supervise play, but it's also important to socialize and train your pup and to teach children how to properly interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nBecause Silkies love their people, it's best if you can be with them for most of the day or can make arrangements for a puppy play date when you'll be gone for a while. (The separation anxiety is real, people.)\r\n\r\nThey do well in houses with yards, but their diminutive size makes them ideal for apartments. However, you'll need to make sure your pup gets their exercise needs met every day (including snowy and rainy ones), or you may become the most hated person in your building. (All. The. Barking.)",

How can you tell them apart? For one, Silky Terriers (aka the Australian Silky Terrier) are bigger than Yorkies. Silkies also come in a range of blues (silvery, steel gray and dark gray), while Yorkies are only dark gray and tan. Thirdly, they come from opposite sides of the world: Yorkies hail from Great Britain, while Silky Terriers originated in Australia.\r\n\r\nSilkies were created in the late 19th century when the native Australian Terrier was crossed with a Yorkshire Terrier. (There may be other terrier breeds lurking in their ancestry, but those can be debated.) The Sydney Silky Terrier was primarily developed to become companion pups, but these dogs proved to be great at controlling vermin on farms. (Great looks \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Erough-and-tumble!)\r\n\r\nIn 1954, \"This Week\" magazine featured a Silky on the cover, and America was won over. In 1955, the Sydney Silky Terrier Club of America was formed. That same year, their name changed in Australia to the Australian Silky Terrier, and the dog became the Silky Terrier in the United States. The American Kennel Club recognized the Silky Terrier in 1959.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Silky Terrier to your family? You can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/silky-terrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E. The cost for a puppy is between $1,000-$2,000. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. If you'd like to adopt a pup, contact Silky Terrier rescues or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.
