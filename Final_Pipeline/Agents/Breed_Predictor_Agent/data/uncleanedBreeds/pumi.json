Homes with a large, fenced backyard or families with access to outdoor spaces are ideal. Apartment living can be tricky—this is a vocal breed that may annoy close neighbors—so if a Pumi pup has already stolen your heart, be sure to enroll them in obedience training from the start to curb the noise.\r\n\r\nPumik also tend to thrive in quiet, relaxed settings, thanks to their reserved nature. They prefer shorter periods away from their family, so if you work long hours or travel extensively, they may not be the breed for you.
