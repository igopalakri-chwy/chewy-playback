Children might need to be reminded not to try to wrestle or play roughly with this pup. Thus, it's not only important that dogs are socialized early on, but also that kids are taught how to properly interact with dogs.\n\nThis ultra-affectionate, lively breed could be trained to excel as a companion dog, emotional therapy dog and a snuggly lapdog for tenderhearted kids and adults.",

Unlike other double-coated dogs (dogs with an undercoat and a topcoat), the powderpuff's undercoat is actually longer than the topcoat and is more prone to tangles. You may also need to give their muzzle a haircut about twice a month, and they only need a bath about once a month (more often if dirty, of course).

By introducing your Chinese Crested to new people and places, you can help them feel more comfortable and confident as they grow up (and curb their nippiness around strangers).\n\nTo socialize your pup, take them on walks so they can see (and sniff!) new people and other dogs. Puppy school is another great way to practice socialization. Here, puppies learn how to play nicely with each other, and they get to meet strangers and discover that people outside their family can be nice, too.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/puppy-potty-training-8-tips-you-havent-tried-yet\"\u003EHousebreaking\u003C/a\u003E a Chinese Crested can be tricky depending on your dog's personality traits—they can be quite sensitive and may shut down emotionally if you're too harsh with them. These intelligent dogs respond well to patient and calm family members. And remember that positive reinforcement can go a long way. (Positive reinforcement rewards pups for a good job with treats, praise and playtime with special toys.) So if your Crested has accidents as you start \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/new-dog/how-to-potty-train-your-dog-in-7-days\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epotty training\u003C/a\u003E, don't give in to your anxiety or frustration. Calmly and gently direct your puppy to where you want them to go potty. And remember to reward them when they do a great job. Practice makes perfect!\n\nSet yourself up for success by buying appropriate dog toys before you bring a Chinese Crested home. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/chew-toys-316\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChew toys\u003C/a\u003E give them a positive outlet for their puppy chewing.

Your veterinarian can help you determine the exact amount and type of food for your Chinese Crested pup. As you browse dog food varieties, be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nSome hairless Chinese Cresteds have missing teeth.

In that case, most vets recommend soft food or experimenting with a combination of soft food and solid kibble. (But check with your vet first.)\r\n\r\nBecause Chinese Cresteds are tiny creatures, even an extra pound can create health problems for you pup, including heart disease. So, be sure to include the treats you give (for training or because you love them) in their overall daily meal count. Instead of leaving food out all day for them to graze, have specific mealtimes when the food is available. If you see your pup gaining a little extra weight, talk with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a mealtime and exercise plan to help your pup lose the weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",

Moderately active, alert and lively, they're not hyperactive or in need of several walks each day. Your Chinese Crested will probably be satisfied with a brisk morning walk plus some evening chasing or tug-of-war in the backyard or house, totaling about 30 minutes. Just don't forget the sunscreen for your hairless variety if you're heading outside to play!\n\nOf course, Chinese Cresteds are known for their \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Chinese Crested origin story goes back centuries—long before breed history was meticulously recorded. The prevailing theory is that giant, hairless dogs were shipped from African nations to China, where the dogs were slowly miniaturized through selective breeding.\r\n\r\nAs Chinese Cresteds became more popular in Asia, they were also brought on board trading ships to take care of the rats. After showing up in ships across the world—from North Africa to South America—they became known as \"Chinese Ship Dogs.\" The breed documented in Europe in the 1800s through paintings and photographs is strikingly similar to the Chinese Crested type.\r\n\r\nThe breed was popularized in North America by two dog-loving professionals, Ida Garrett and Debra Woods. Through their observations and communications about Chinese Cresteds, the breed grew in popularity until they were welcomed into the American Kennel Club Stud Book in 1991.\r\n\r\nFun fact: Because of their spellbinding, fantastical appearance (especially that of the hairless variety), some folks refer to this breed as \"The Dr. Seuss Dog.\"\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find a Chinese Crested puppy? You can find reputable breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/chinese-crested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club's website\u003C/a\u003E. The price for a puppy is about $1,200-$2,000, depending on the breeder. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been carefully screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
