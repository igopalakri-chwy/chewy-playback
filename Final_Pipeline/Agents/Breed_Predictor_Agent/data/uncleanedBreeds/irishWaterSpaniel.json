Naturally, they love exercise that incorporates games. They'll even make a game out of training and often change the rules to amuse themselves. Teaching them to fetch? Expect them to find something else entirely different to fetch than what you threw, or to make a lot of stops on the way back to you. It's no wonder they have a reputation for being a class clown.\n\nWith their athletic abilities and love of retrieving, they should be kept on a leash outside in case a squirrel catches their eye. Otherwise, you may have a runaway dog on your hands.\n\nIrish Water Spaniels are very rarely aggressive, although they may be cautious around strangers. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEarly exposure to plenty of other dogs\u003C/a\u003E and people ensures this breed will live up to their friendly tendencies and help them be more comfortable in new situations and around new people and other dogs.

Start socializing your dog while in puppyhood to help bring out their friendly tendencies (and don't forget to teach the kids in their life how to play nicely with them, too).",

        "grooming": "Great news! Irish Water Spaniels are a low- to no-shed breed. While you won't have to contend with dog hair tumbleweeds rolling around the house, you'll still want to brush your pup at least once a week. Give the whole coat a gentle once-over with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/bristle-brush-dog-brushes-combs_c356_f70v83784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enatural bristle brush\u003C/a\u003E to dislodge any dirt or debris, then use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-combs_c355_f70v83785\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewide-toothed comb\u003C/a\u003E on both layers of their double coat.

        "training": "Training an Irish Water Spaniel puppy can be fun. This highly intelligent breed loves to please and learns quickly. But their independent nature can spell frustration for first-time pet parents, which is why they're usually recommended for someone who has experience with dogs. Irish Water Spaniels need someone who will be patient, calm and consistent. You can't give in and let this pup have their way if you want a well-behaved dog. And don't be afraid to enlist the help of a certified \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/find-a-dog-trainer\"\u003Etrainer\u003C/a\u003E or behaviorist. They can teach you how to work with your dog to bring the best out of your pup.\n\nFirst, teach your pup the basics, like how to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome when called\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Ehow to walk nicely on a leash\u003C/a\u003E.

Just be prepared for your spaniel to change up the game—they like to make their own rules sometimes. (Hey! It's all part of the fun.)\n\nBe sure to use lots of positive reinforcement—treats, scritches, lots of praise—to reward your dog for doing a good job and redirecting them when they do something you don't want. This breed loves to have fun, so make sure the sessions are fun and engaging and take breaks to play for a bit before both of you get frustrated.\n\nSocialization is very important for the breed, since they're naturally reserved around strangers. Getting your pup used to new new people and dogs while they're young helps them be comfortable in new situations as they grow up. Start taking your Irish Water Spaniel puppy on walks and let them safely meet new people and other dogs. Also consider enrolling in puppy preschool where they learn how to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people all in one location.",

Choose a formula that fits their age (puppy, adult or senior), and make sure to look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though these pups are energetic, you still need to be careful not to overfeed your pup. An extra pound or two can create health issues for your dog, like heart disease or arthritis. If you notice your pup's gaining extra weight, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you put together a diet and exercise plan to help your dog lose the extra weight and still maintain their nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "Irish Water Spaniels' exercise needs can't be overstated. Originally bred as hunting dogs, nothing makes Irish Water Spaniels' tail wag more than playing fetch in a wide-open space or a body of water where they can show off their impressive swimming skills. Before bringing an Irish Water Spaniel into your home, make sure your lifestyle is as active as the pup.\n\nShort leash walks won't be enough for these athletic animals—they need one to two hours exercising outside a day. As their name suggests, they love swimming or any activity involving water. On land, they've got a confident gait that can cover some serious ground.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to keep an Irish Water Spaniel active, including inviting them along for your own trail running, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/general/ready-to-hit-the-hiking-trail-with-your-dog-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\"\u003Ehiking\u003C/a\u003E or biking excursions. As retrievers, these dogs are skilled at fetch, which gives them a chance to speed around the backyard. They also are great at dog sports like dock diving (playing fetch in the water), agility or \u003Ca href=\"http://www.flyball.org/\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E.",
        "ideal_environment": "Irish Water Spaniels need space to run and will be happiest in the suburbs or the country where they have the opportunity to expend their energy every day. Apartment living isn't out of the question, so long as this large dog has room to move around and you have access to wide-open spaces, like a nearby dog park, where this pup can expend their energy reserves.\r\n\r\nTrue to their name, Irish Water Spaniels dream of a home near a body of water like a river, lake or beach. Give them the chance to get in a few laps each day, and they'll be happy as a clam. And thanks to their temperature-regulating double coats that are perfect for swimming in cold water, Irish Water Spaniels aren't too sensitive to hot or cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are great around kids, are usually friendly with other people and make excellent family pets. Other dogs-in-law will be welcome friends, but smaller cats or other animals may stir up the breed's sporting traits unless they've had proper training and socialization since puppyhood.",

Boatswain, his beloved pup, became the first official Irish Water Spaniel purebred.\r\n\r\nBy 1859, this new kind of spaniel began to appear in dog shows. The breed came to the United States in the 1870s, where it became a popular sporting dog. It was one of just nine breeds to be registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) as early as 1878, six years before the club's official establishment. The organization recognized the breed in 1884 after the club was founded. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel breed is still considered relatively rare.\r\n\r\nLooking to add an Irish Water Spaniel to your home? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/irish-water-spaniel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAmerican Kennel Club website\u003C/a\u003E.
