Check out the Pharaoh Hound. This crusading, clever canine can display many cat-like tendencies: aloofness, superiority and stealth (watch the food on the counter!). But don't be fooled by their regal appearance; there's plenty of personality lying beneath their stately stature. Joyful and alert, these dogs have a habit of lifting their lips to reveal a silly, sweet smile. And when they blush? Be still your heart! The signature rosy-pink flush on their ears, nose and chest, which appears when they are excited, is actually due to a lack of pigment on their nose and ears. Pharaoh Hounds aren't exactly the socialite type, but they will loyally bestow affection upon their favorite human (that's you). Just don't expect cuddles—that won't mesh with their high-brow style.",

They tend to get along well with other dogs who can match their boundless high energy levels. But they also have very strong chasing and hunting instincts, so whenever they're around small animals, you'll have to watch them like an addictive Netflix show.\r\n\r\nAs the saying goes, these dogs' bark is worse than their bite, which is rare. With their poised and peaceful demeanor, Pharaoh Hounds are known for their intelligence—you will be awed on the regular by their one-two punch of brains and brawn. When these two work together, it can result in antics that'll have you laughing out loud—or cursing their wily ways. Case in point: They are often called “counter-surfers\" thanks to their swiftness in scaling heights to scoop up food left out, a mischievous prank that is equal parts hilarious and maddening (not to mention dangerous, if they ingest something that's toxic to dogs).\r\n\r\nPharaoh Hounds bond unapologetically with one single family member they deem their favorite.

But with positive reinforcement, aka rewarding good behavior with treats, toys and praise, they often respond well.

Never, ever train off-leash unless you have a very large outdoor space surrounded by six-foot fencing. If you don't have that luxury, think about investing in a long \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/standard-2582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eleash\u003C/a\u003E in the interest of successful training and the safety of your (likely) runaway hound on the search for prey.

It would be a shame for this gloriously graceful dog not to be shown off in their best light and win the hearts of all who meet them.\n\nAll dogs bark, but the Pharaoh Hound is one breed who stays vocal beyond puppyhood. While you may want your fur baby to have their say, you don't want it to become a nuisance, so it's worth spending time on some \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-train-dog-not-to-bark\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etraining to curb the barking\u003C/a\u003E.",

These dogs are especially voracious eaters when they're young and growing, up until around 2 or 3 years old, after which their appetites level out considerably. Talk to your veterinarian about how much to feed your Pharaoh Hound to make sure they're getting enough nutrients and the right amount of calories.\r\n\r\nPharaoh Hounds love their treats, which can be a fantastic aid for training these high-achievers—but don't overdo it and accidentally sabotage their svelteness. Treat calories count, so be sure to factor them into your dog's overall nutritional plan. It's also important to make sure your Pharaoh Hound has access to an abundance of fresh, clean water.\r\n\r\nConsult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet to meet your Pharaoh Hound's unique health and medical needs. They can also help you devise a feeding chart on how much and how often to feed your capable companion.",
        "exercise": "With a high prey instinct, the Pharaoh Hound breed is a natural athlete who loves the full-speed galloping thrill of the chase and hunt, making small animals like squirrels, rabbits, birds, lizards and butterflies fair game. They're also highly intelligent escape artists, so they should only be let off-leash in a large enclosed area with six-foot high fencing. To satiate their chasing instincts, you may want to look into lure coursing, which will allow your Pharaoh Hound to chase a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. Just keep in mind that they are flight risks due to their high prey drive, so make sure the lure does a loop back in your direction!\n\nYou can also count jumping, digging and chewing among their strengths (and potential downfalls), which is why they do best in active homes where they have the opportunity to play, run and exert themselves daily. If dog sports like lure coursing aren't on the agenda daily, remember that your Pharaoh Hound will need two three-minute \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/walking-with-dog\"\u003Ewalks\u003C/a\u003E a day to keep your new satin cushions safe from any anti-social behavior.\n\nPharaoh Hounds make great running companions, but are lightning-fast so you may not be able to keep up. When not showcasing their sleek strength and vivacious vigor, they like to lounge around the house with their human companions. A dedicated dog lover who can appreciate the Pharaoh Hound's natural zest for adventure and bestow upon them multiple walks or runs each day on-leash, preferably in warmer climates, will ultimately win their big ol' heart (picky though it may be).",
        "ideal_environment": "Pharaoh Hounds thrive in a setting worthy of their prestige: a home with good-sized yard with at least six-foot fencing to contain their athletic ability and energetic nature. Pharaoh Hounds get along well with kids and other animals when raised with them, but early socialization is important, as is careful introduction to strangers. It's also important to teach kiddos how to properly interact with pups.\r\n\r\nThe climate is also important to a Pharaoh Hound's ability to thrive. They don't have an undercoat, so they'll need extra protection in the elements. Start shopping for a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/coats-jackets-1903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edog coat\u003C/a\u003E and some \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/sweaters-hoodies-1962\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esweaters\u003C/a\u003E to keep them in tip-top toasty conditions during colder months.\r\n\r\nPharaoh Hounds do enjoy the outdoors, and they will ask you for some physical and mental stimulation with those amber eyes of theirs. Give it to them—otherwise, they may cause some mischief while entertaining themselves.\r\n\r\nDue to their high prey drive, Pharaoh Hounds will be off to the races in no time if they're allowed off-leash, making the perfect pet parent and experienced one who can match a Pharaoh Hound's strong will and independent spirit and curb their natural tendency to take off.",

        "h2_breed_history": "Pharaoh Hounds are one of the oldest documented breeds in history, and what a history they have. It's said they resemble the Egyptian god Anubis, and have remain unchanged since the earliest depiction of Egyptian dogs in ancient tombs—one dating back to the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. With the breed's origin going as far back at 4400 B.C., you might say the Pharaoh Hound is timeless.\r\n\r\nEven though the Pharaoh Hound dog is most commonly associated with ancient Egypt, the modern version of the Pharaoh Hound has their roots in Malta. Lore has it that the Phoenicians transported the hound from Egypt to the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo, just south of Sicily and east of Tunisia. Here, the Pharaoh Hound remained isolated from the rest of the world for over 2,000 years, giving the people of Malta the ability to refine the breed as we see them today. The Maltese proudly stake their claim as cultivators of the Pharaoh Hound, which they refer to as \u003Ci\u003EKelb tal-Fenek, \u003C/i\u003Emeaning “rabbit dog.\" That name makes perfect sense, because this national dog of Malta was originally used by farmers primarily for hunting rabbits.\r\n\r\nDespite their tales from antiquity, the Pharaoh Hound can be considered a 1980's dog by American Kennel Club (AKC) standards. The breed was recognized as part of its Hound group (dogs bred for hunting) on August 1, 1983.\r\n\r\nReady to add a Pharaoh Hound to your family? You can find a list of responsible Pharaoh Hound breeders at the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/pharaoh-hound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC website\u003C/a\u003E or through the \u003Ca href=\"https://ph-club.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PHCA-Preferred-Breeders-rev4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EPharaoh Hound Club of America\u003C/a\u003E. The average cost for a Pharaoh Hound puppy is $1,500-$2,500 depending on the breeder. For that price, you're usually getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.
