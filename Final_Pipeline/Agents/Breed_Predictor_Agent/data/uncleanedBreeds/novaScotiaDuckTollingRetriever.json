They're also great with other dogs, and if raised around cats as a puppy, they'll accept felines. Be warned: A Toller dog's energy level and drive may sometimes be too much for cats.\r\n\r\nThe Toller breed is a friendly, social and loving dog, so start socializing them while they're puppies to bring out these wonderful traits as they grow up. Just be warned: pent-up energy will express itself in unwanted behaviors if they don't get enough physical and mental exercise. These pups are not for people who love the couch more than activity.",

Tollers are very loving and affectionate, so pet parents committed to respecting their intelligence, playfulness and work ethic will reap the rewards of having this awesome dog to call their own.",
        "grooming": "The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed has a waterproof double coat, and they are moderate shedders, but they'll shed more during the fall and spring. Plan on brushing your Toller weekly to keep their coat in tip-top shape. Take time to brush the fur around their ears, which tends to get knotted. Use a slicker brush, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/safari-self-cleaning-slicker-brush/dp/46213\"\u003ESafari Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush\u003C/a\u003E. And during shedding season, carve out time daily to help keep the shedding fur at bay.\n\nWhile brushing their fur, check out the fur between their toes. The fur that grows between their toes can cover their pads. Trim the hair on their paws as needed to ensure they get good traction when walking on slippery surfaces. Speaking of their toes, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etrim your Toller's nails\u003C/a\u003E every month. You'll know their nails are too long if you hear your pup coming on hard surfaces. (That familiar click-clack song.)\n\nYou can bathe your Tolling Retriever once every four to six weeks. Your Toller dog may need more frequent bathing based on outdoor activities and whether they're due for a good scrub after a particularly muddy excursion.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003EBrush your dog's teeth\u003C/a\u003E at least a few times a week and work up to every day. It's best to start the teeth brushing routine when your Toller is a puppy, so they'll get used to it. Keeping your dog's teeth clean ensures they stay healthy overall. Beyond curbing bad breath, daily brushing prevents plaque and tartar build-up, which leads to tooth decay and possibly life-threatening infections—plan on having your Toller's teeth cleaned professionally yearly by your vet (not your groomer).",
        "training": "Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are bright, independent and not as eager to please as the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\"\u003EGolden Retriever\u003C/a\u003E. Therefore, they need a confident and patient trainer to guide them. Being lovingly firm and consistent is key for training. And foundational obedience skills—sit, stay, come and how to walk nicely on a leash—are a must.\r\n\r\nWhen training, keep your sessions short (10 minutes or so); otherwise, they'll get bored with endless repetition. Reward-based training methods (focusing on what they do right and re-directing them when they don't do what you want) work well for them, too. Mix up their rewards and use treats, praise and play breaks when they do a good job.\r\n\r\nSocialization is also important for a Toller puppy. Take your pup for walks and let them experience new people, other dogs and new situations. Puppy school is a great place to start. Puppies learn to play nicely with each other, and they get to mix and mingle with other people.",
        "diet_nutrition": "The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever typically does well on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). And consider supplementing your Toller's food with a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/s?query=fish%20oil%20supplement%20dogs&amp;nav-submit-button=\"\u003Efish oil supplement\u003C/a\u003E to help keep their skin and coat healthy.\r\n\r\nAs you plan your pup's meals, remember to include all the treats you give. Remember that treats = calories, and even a few extra pounds can create health problems for your pup. Talk with your vet if you see your pup gaining a pound or two. They are in the best position to help you create a meal and exercise plan to help your dog shed weight and maintain their nutritional needs.",
        "exercise": "A Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever's energy level is high, so they'll need about an hour of exercise daily. As a dog born with a job to do (work with hunters), these pups don't do well with idle time. If they can't get rid of their energy every day, they will find ways to entertain themselves—and your shoes and your home will be the worst for it.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy running, you're in luck; Tollers are fast—they can reach up to 45 mph! So, lace up your running shoes and take your Toller with you. They also enjoy swimming and games like fetch or hide-and-seek. Take your pup for a few walks during the day and give them plenty of time to play off-leash (in the backyard or at the dog park). \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/balls-2329\"\u003EDog ball toys\u003C/a\u003E are great for endless ball-chasing antics your pup will love (all that retrieving).\r\n\r\nAny activities that allow them to use their bodies and brains are also great. Get your Toller into dog sports, like agility or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.flyball.org/aboutflyball.html\"\u003Eflyball\u003C/a\u003E. These competitive sports are great ways to strengthen your bond. When Tollers exercise enough, they're happy to cuddle up with you and lounge on the couch—an excellent way to relax at the end of a day of play.",
        "ideal_environment": "A Toller is happiest in a home with a large yard where they have room to play and exercise. This pup is medium-sized, so they may do OK in a smaller house or apartment if they have daily access to outdoor space to run and play. (This includes lazy days and stormy or cold days, too!) This water-loving pooch would be thrilled if you have a swimming pool they could play in. (And they wouldn't say no to a nearby pond or lake.)\r\n\r\nTollers are wonderful dogs for active pet parents willing to put the time into exercising them. They may not be as ideal for first-time pup parents as, say, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\"\u003ELabrador Retriever\u003C/a\u003E, but as long as you're committed to their training and exercise needs, this pup can be a good fit.\r\n\r\nRaising a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever with kids and other pets will ensure your home is always full of laughter and fun escapades—you may find your only quiet time is at night! These pups are happy with their family, wherever that may be, at home or on your travels or local adventures.",

        "h2_breed_history": "It's all in a name when it comes to the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever's origin. This breed hails from the Little River District of Nova Scotia, where 19th-century sportsmen first bred them. Their nickname, Little River Duck Dog, is an homage to their origins.\r\n\r\nTollers were bred with a particular purpose in mind. These \"decoy dogs\" are designed to imitate foxes in size and color. Hunters took them along the river banks to act as a decoy to splash along the shoreline and lure curious ducks to shore. (Did you know ducks are fascinated by foxes? They are, though the exact reason why is unclear.) The breed's name includes a derivative of the Middle English word \u003Cem\u003Etollen\u003C/em\u003E, which means to lure. Once the ducks came to see what commotion the Tollers were causing, they were poised for hunters to shoot them. The history of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is still evident in the breed's personality—they are inexhaustible, hardworking dogs capable of retrieving without seeming to stop.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever in 2003. Not surprisingly, they are the breed with the longest name in the AKC Studbook.\r\n\r\nHoping to add a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever to your pack?
