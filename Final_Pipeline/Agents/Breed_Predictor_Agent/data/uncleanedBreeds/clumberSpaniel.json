Incorporate a combination of physical and mental stimulation for an added challenge. Clumbers belong to the American Kennel Club's Sporting group, which includes dogs who were specifically bred to hunt and retrieve. As hunters, the Clumber Spaniel breed excels at scent work, so engage them in training games to take advantage of their desire to follow their noses. Just remember not to let them off-leash without a secure fence, or else following a scent could get them lost.
