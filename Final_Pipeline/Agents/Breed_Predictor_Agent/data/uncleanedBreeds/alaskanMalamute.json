        "h2_breed_temperament": "Alaskan Malamute dogs thrive on human attention and are happy to welcome a crowd to your house. They don't play favorites with family members, either—they're equal-opportunity snugglers. They're not barkers, but they are chatty—yelps, howls and \"woo woos\" are all found in their repertoire, so expect them to join in on the conversation.\r\n\r\nGoofy dogs with a lovable personality, Mals are also great with kids and babies, although they'll need to be supervised around small children. They're big dogs, so they might accidentally knock a child over, and if they nip, they could cause injury. (They do have a strong bite force.)\r\n\r\nWhile Alaskan Malamutes are not aggressive toward people, they can be strong-willed. Plus, this breed has a high prey drive and may not respond well to other dogs if not properly socialized and trained. They also have a penchant for taking off after critters or cats, so think twice about off-leash adventures. For these reasons, it's best to train your pup from the get-go.\r\n\r\nThese athletic dogs are always up for outdoor playtime, especially if you give them a job. If you don't have a sled, this working dog breed is just as willing to pull you on a bike. Or just strap a backpack on your Mal and go hiking.\r\n\r\nSavvy problem-solvers, Malamutes are capable of finding new ways to dig under the fence or chew up the furniture unless you keep them challenged. Games of hide-and-seek and teaching them cool tricks are all good ways to exercise their brains. So are dog sports like agility, rally and bikejoring (a sport created to help keep sled dogs in shape in off-winter months).",
        "h2_how_to_care_for_a_breed": "All that fluffy, gorgeous fur in an athlete's body means these dogs are high maintenance. An Alaskan Malamute puppy or dog needs daily exercise (mental and physical), a lot of grooming (daily brushing during shedding seasons) and a job to do, or they get bored. And training is a must with these strong-willed dogs.",
        "grooming": "That thick double coat needs TLC—so brushing once or twice a week during non-shedding seasons (summer and winter) is a must to keep your dog's coat healthy and free of mats. Get a firm \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-bristle-brushes_c355_f70v83784\"\u003Ebristle brush\u003C/a\u003E, but avoid using a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/furminator-long-hair-dog-deshedding/dp/269737\"\u003EFurminator\u003C/a\u003E; these de-shedding tools cut a Malamute's top coat hairs, causing them to grow back bent or discolored.\n\nTheir shedding abilities are no joke—it happens twice a year, and even daily brushing doesn't help as much as taking a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/metrovac-air-force-commander-two/dp/131666\"\u003Ehi\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/dryers-2467\"\u003Egh-powered pet-grooming dryer\u003C/a\u003E and blowing all that hair away once or twice a week as needed. If you think you can get away with shaving your Mal, forget it. Shaving won't keep your Malamute cooler in the summer; their double coat actually helps keep them cool. Plus, their coat protects them from sunburn and bug bites, and you will probably ruin that gorgeous coat forever.\n\nMalamutes aren't overly dirty dogs, so they won't need a bath very often. Their top coat repels rain and mud, so aim for a bath every two months or so. Be sure to dry your Mal thoroughly after a bath (or a swim) to prevent \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/hot-spots-on-dogs\"\u003Ehot spots\u003C/a\u003E (inflamed skin lesions).\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003EBrush their teeth\u003C/a\u003E at least a few times a week to keep your pup's teeth healthy. You can brush them with your finger or a brush made for dogs, using a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/toothpastes-2598\"\u003Edog-appropriate toothpaste\u003C/a\u003E. Once a year, have your vet give them a professional cleaning. All this dental hygiene helps prevent dental disease down the road.\n\nYour Malamute will need to have their nails trimmed about every two months. If you can hear your dog's nails click on the floor, cut them. You can use \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/nail-clippers-1430\"\u003Edoggy nail clippers\u003C/a\u003E (and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Ethis how-to\u003C/a\u003E) or take your Mal to a groomer or vet to get them trimmed.",
        "training": "Alaskan Malamutes are smart and surprisingly easy to train, but they also get distracted easily and have a reputation for being stubborn. You can work around their independent nature with clever ways to motivate your Alaskan Malamute dog. The key is to use plenty of tasty treats as rewards and quick, 5-minute sessions instead of long, repetitive drills. If you're attending a dog training class, take breaks when your Malamute starts acting up.\r\n\r\nBut don't skimp on or skip obedience training. It's super important. Your pup will learn the basics like sit, stay and come, plus they'll learn how to walk nicely on a leash. Mals are big dogs and will run wild if you let them. Luckily, Malamutes will do anything for food, but they're easily distracted, so remember to keep those training sessions short.\r\n\r\nYou may dig your dog, but your Mal will dig up your yard. Alaskan Malamutes are born diggers, and while no amount of training will completely erase that habit, you can minimize their digging instincts through training and exercise. (A tired Mal is a content Mal.)\r\n\r\nTraining is a great way to keep your Malamute's brain engaged, too—this breed loves to learn tricks, and well-trained ones can even excel as therapy dogs, thanks to their affectionate, people-loving natures.",
        "diet_nutrition": "There's no one-size-fits-all recommendation for feeding your Alaskan Malamute—your vet can give you the best advice for their diet based on your dog's activity level, age and weight. It's important to know that Malamutes tend to put on weight—their ancestors were designed to work hard on very little food, and their metabolism is such that they don't need as much food as other large dogs. Plus, their thick coat can hide their ribs and waist, so you need to feel through the coat to their skin to make sure your Mal isn't packing on the pounds.\r\n\r\nTo keep your dog healthy and lean, look for high-quality, mid-fat and mid-to-high-protein dog food like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/farmina-nd-ancestral-grain-chicken/dp/202214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFarmina N&amp;D\u003C/a\u003E. You might want to give your Mal fatty acid supplements to keep that coat shiny and healthy, too. Be sure to watch those treats—they count as calories, yet they're essential for motivating your Malamute during training sessions.",
        "exercise": "The Alaskan Malamute's exercise needs are pretty high—Mals were bred to be active dogs, so they need a couple of hours of exercise every day. Their exercise can include a few good walks—brisk ones and slower ones—to give them the chance to explore with their nose. Did we mention they love to run? If you're craving a jogging buddy, leash up your Alaskan Malamute. After you're done, play chase with your pup in the backyard to ensure they're tired out. If you live in warmer weather, make sure you keep your outdoor activity to the cooler parts of the day; these dogs thrive in colder temperatures.\r\n\r\nAnd since they're sled dogs, they'll love pulling you places. You can harness them to a small sled in the winter or a kick bike (or regular one) on dry terrain and have a ball. This breed also excels at dog sports like agility and weight pulling, so reach out to your local Malamute club (most states have them) to find events that your Mal will enjoy.",
        "ideal_environment": "Malamutes can do fine in smaller homes—as long as you're ready to spend lots of time outdoors to provide for their daily exercise needs. A fenced-in backyard or access to a fenced-in public space is a must as this breed will chase cats and squirrels. And because they dig, make sure the fence is secure (and potentially extends into the ground) and consider giving them a place where they're allowed to make holes if you have space in your yard.\n\nThe Alaskan Malamute breed isn't suited to apartment living; these dogs are noisy. They don't bark much, but they do howl and yelp. Mals can also be destructive when they're bored, which is why they require experienced and active pet parents. And while they can romp outside for hours in zero temps, you'll need to keep your Alaskan Malamute dog \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/pet-parenting/the-best-products-to-keep-dogs-cool-in-the-summer\"\u003Ecool in the summer\u003C/a\u003E (fans and kiddie pools help).\n\nThis breed makes for a good family dog, though they're capable of knocking down the youngest kids without meaning to. They thrive on attention, so if you're having a party, your Mal will definitely want to mingle!",
        "h2_breed_health": "Alaskan Malamutes have a life expectancy of 10 to 14 years, but like many large breeds, they’re prone to some health issues. It’s good to know what they are in advance, so you can discuss with your vet how to keep your Alaskan Malamute healthy throughout their life. If you’re getting your pup through a breeder, make sure they’ve screened the puppies and their parents for potential health problems.

If you have any concerns about your pup’s joints, discuss those with your vet who may recommend a physical examination and x-rays to help determine what is going on. If diagnosed with hip or elbow dysplasia, treatment options may include weight management, pain medications, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/cat/food-and-nutrition/choosing-the-best-joint-supplements-for-dogs\"\u003Ejoint supplements\u003C/a\u003E, or in severe cases surgery.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECataracts\u003C/strong\u003E: Malamutes and other Artic breeds can develop hereditary \u003Ca href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/eye/c_dg_cataract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecataracts\u003C/a\u003E. These can be screened for through genetic testing so be sure to inquire with the breeder. If the vet diagnoses cataracts, surgery will likely be recommended to restore vision. Additionally, Alaskan malamutes can inherit the gene mutation for achromatopsia, otherwise known as “day blindness,” which affects the retina and makes it hard for dogs to see during the day. There is no current treatment for day blindness but it is important to see your veterinarian right away if you feel your pup is having trouble seeing.\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEpilepsy\u003C/strong\u003E: Malamutes can inherit a tendency to have seizures, typically starting after puppyhood. When dogs have a seizure, they can stiffen, fall, and then begin to jerk. If you suspect your pet is having or has had a seizure, contact your vet immediately. It may be useful to try to record the episode on video for your vet to see.

        "h2_breed_history": "The Alaskan Malamute's origins date back thousands of years. Like their cousin, the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/husky/\"\u003ESiberian Husky\u003C/a\u003E, Alaskan Malamutes were sled dogs—one of the most ancient Arctic breeds. But unlike Siberians, the Inuits bred Mals to haul heavy loads on sleds slowly over long distances, so speed wasn't as prized as their power and strength.\r\n\r\nMalamutes have hauled sleds for miners during Alaska's gold rush in the late 1890s, adventured on expeditions to the South Pole—including the first one in the late 1920s—and aided US forces during World War II.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Alaskan Malamute breed in 1935. Tragically, after the war, there were few Malamutes left, so Malamute lovers began breeding these dogs again. Now, they rank 67th on the AKC's list of popular dogs.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Malamute history continues their rich tradition into the 21st century. In 2010, Malamutes became Alaska's state dog (sorry, Siberians!). Now you can find these gorgeous dogs on Instagram, in the movies (usually as stand-ins for wolves), and in all 50 states—even the hotter ones.\r\n\r\nIf you've got the chops to raise an Alaskan Malamute and want one of these adorable pups, visit the \u003Ca href=\"http://alaskanmalamute.org/\"\u003EAlaskan Malamute Club of America's\u003C/a\u003E website to find a reputable breeder. An Alaskan Malamute puppy costs around $2,000. For that price, you are usually getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. Beware of breeders who want to sell you “rare\" types like red or \"giant\" Mals—it's a marketing ploy to up their prices. You can go the rescue route; sadly, many inexperienced pet parents find their Alaskan Malamute dogs are handfuls and end up rehoming them. Contact a local Alaskan Malamute rescue, keep your eyes open for the breed at your local shelter, or search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-alaskan-malamute_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",

And since they shed heavily twice a year, they're not the best breed for people with allergies.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Alaskan Malamutes Huskies?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nNo, Alaskan Malamutes aren't Huskies. While they're both Arctic sled dogs that look like wolves, Siberian Huskies are smaller, have a softer coat and often have blue eyes. (A Malamute's eye color is always brown.)\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow big do Alaskan Malamutes get?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nAlaskan Malamutes get big. The standard-sized Alaskan Malamute weighs between 75 to 85 pounds, but the range can go as low as 65 and as high as 100 pounds. Then there are the so-called \"giant\" Alaskan Malamutes, which are just super-sized Mals that weigh over 100 pounds.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Alaskan Malamutes smart?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nAlaskan Malamutes are so smart they can find new ways to make trouble at home (some have been known to figure out how to unlock their crate!). Of course, you can work with that Alaskan Malamute intelligence by training your dog and giving them a job to do.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EAre Alaskan Malamutes good guard dogs?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nNo, Alaskan Malamutes do not make good guard dogs. They may look big and scary, but they are total mushes around people. They are truly the life of the party.\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are the most common Alaskan Malamute mixes?\u003C/h3\u003E\r\nThe most common Alaskan Malamute mixes are:\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute–\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/husky/\"\u003ESiberian Husky\u003C/a\u003E mix (Huskamute or Alusky)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute–\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/german-shepherd/\"\u003EGerman Shepherd\u003C/a\u003E mix (Alaskan Shepherd)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute—Wolf mix (Wolamute)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute—\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/poodle/\"\u003EPoodle\u003C/a\u003E mix (Malamoodle)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute–\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\"\u003EGolden Retriever\u003C/a\u003E mix (Alaskan Goldenmute)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute—\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/rottweiler/\"\u003ERottweiler\u003C/a\u003E mix (MalaRott)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute–\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/\"\u003ELabrador Retriever\u003C/a\u003E mix (Alaskan Malador)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n \t\u003Cli\u003EAlaskan Malamute–\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/great-pyrenees/\"\u003EGreat Pyrenees\u003C/a\u003E mix (Malaneese)\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\nNote: These are not purebred dogs but mixed breeds.",
