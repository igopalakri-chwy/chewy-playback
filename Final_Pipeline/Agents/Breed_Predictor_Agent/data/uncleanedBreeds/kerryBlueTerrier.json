Like other terriers, they tend to be fearless, energetic, mischievous and tenacious (yes, they can be a handful!). A potential Kerry pet parent must bear in mind that this tough-as-nails former hunting and guard dog was bred to work at singular tasks, which can make Kerry Blue Terrier training somewhat challenging, though still achievable.\r\n\r\nRaising a Kerry Blue Terrier as a family pet is a fine idea as long as early and consistent training is on the schedule. They don't enjoy being left alone for long, so if you work outside the home, you may want to sign up for doggie daycare or enlist the aid of a dog sitter or neighbor to stop by for some playtime. Supervise small children around a new dog, as you should with every dog breed.\r\n\r\nThe Kerry Blue Terrier is friendly and playful on the whole, but when it comes to other dogs and cats in the home, they don't play nice with others. Alas... With that in mind, Kerry Blue Terriers are happiest when they're the (sole) animal pack leader and your only pet.\r\n\r\nAs all-purpose working terriers, the Kerry Blue held many past positions, including livestock herder, sheep guardian and CEO in charge of removing any and all vermin, such as mice, otters, badgers and hares. Today's Kerry Blue Terrier characteristics feature high energy and a lively manner, making this breed a lovely canine companion for the get-up-and-go set.",

        "training": "When you start to train your pup, you'll appreciate the Kerry Blue Terrier's innate intelligence. Kerries are smart dogs and love to engage with their family, whether competing in a race, sitting for a treat, or following other obedience commands. Still, take note of the headstrong nature that's a key Kerry Blue Terrier trait. The same toughness that enables terriers to track and hunt vermin can also make them somewhat stubborn during training. But you're headstrong, too, right? So it's all good. That's why you two will get along.\r\n\r\nA good Kerry strategy is to keep your training methods positive and consistent. Consider a puppy training class with a canine expert with deep terrier breed knowledge. Training young in puppyhood is also essential as Kerry Blue Terrier puppies need proper socialization to adjust to family life at home. Take your pup on walks to meet new dogs and other people and enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet other pet parents in one location.",

Still, don't lavish your Kerry with too many, as this practice can lead to excessive weight gain. Lastly, water is important for good health, so always keep a bowl of fresh H2O on hand for your pet.\u003C/span\u003E",
        "exercise": "The Kerry Blue Terrier exercise needs are on the high side, so plan on taking your pet outside for at least two walks a day for 30 minutes each—and possibly a third if you're an apartment dweller without a yard out back for your dog to romp in. Because the Kerry Blue Terrier's energy level is also high, one daily outing should consist of active exercise such as playing fetch, jogging in the park or chasing the pet parent around in a circle. Hope you don't get dizzy much!\r\n\r\nAs a former working animal, the Kerry Blue Terrier's speed is innate, making the breed a good candidate for a canine agility course, scent games (hide a toy with a treat tucked inside!) or even dock diving if you have access to a lake, pond or pool. Multi-sport days may be in order to keep these Kerry Blue Terrier types thoroughly entertained.",
        "ideal_environment": "A Kerry Blue Terrier's qualities thrive in a home with active, exercise-loving pet parents who are willing to put up with some strong-willed behavior as they work to train. Combining a Kerry Blue Terrier dog with kids goes well if early socialization and obedience lessons are also in place, but this terrier might not be as accepting of other canines and cats as they are of children (thanks to their history as hunters). So, if you plan to have more than one pup in your home or love to foster kittens, skip over the Kerry in favor of another breed.\r\n\r\nOutdoor space is a major bonus when considering adding the Kerry Blue into your life, partly because it's easier for this animal to get the exercise they need right out the back door. But if you live in an apartment or small home with a little grass to play on, you can still keep this dog happy with an extra walk a day or by engaging in some fun doggie training exercises.\r\nKerries do best with experienced pet parents since terriers aren't typically super easy to teach to sit and heel. But if you're terrier-savvy and know what to expect, a Kerry might suit you and your living situation.",

Also known as the Irish Blue Terrier for apparent reasons, the true Kerry Blue Terrier origin is a bit of a mystery. Some believe Irish laborers bred the Kerry in response to the much larger, noble-class-favored \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/irish-wolfhound/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EIrish Wolfhounds\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003E. And while the Wolfhound's job was to keep illicit hunters off of their masters' property, the more stealth, diminutive Kerry Blue Terrier allowed those laborers to poach game on these same noble grounds.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EThere's also evidence that the Kerry Blue's original role was that of a utility terrier on the farm. Stepping in to help in myriad ways, this dog hunted down pesky creatures like rats, rabbits and badgers and aided in guarding and herding livestock such as cattle and sheep. In England and their native Ireland, the breed also assisted in hunting small game and birds, retrieving them from the land and water once the hunters hit their marks.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EThe Kerry Blue Terrier has a patriotic streak as a mascot for those who strove for Irish independence. The breed first came to North America in 1918 and started to appear in various dog shows in the early 1920s. Today's Kerry Blue is still well-equipped to find a mouse in the house, but most pet parents set up a comfy dog bed near the fireplace so their beloved companion can relax instead.\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003EIf you're considering this blue-coated dog, which the American Kennel Club recognized in 1922, keep in mind that Kerry Blue Terrier prices tend to range between $2,000 to $2,500 for puppies.
