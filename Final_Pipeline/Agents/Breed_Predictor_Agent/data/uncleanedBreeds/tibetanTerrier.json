They're an interesting combination of toddler and tween, cat and class valedictorian.\r\n\r\nWith a gentle temperament, the Tibetan Terrier's biting tendencies are lower than the average dog breed, but be aware that, in their playful youth, they tend to be pretty mouthy and are prone to nibbling.

They're great with kids, too, but because Tibetan Terriers are a pretty sensitive breed, they'll do better with older kids who understand the importance of boundaries and respect for a dog's space. It's always advised to supervise any dog breed when playing around toddlers and younger ones. Kids should also be taught how to interact with dogs.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are friendly, though not quite extroverts, so they can appear pretty standoffish and aloof to guests in the home. On the other paw, this ancient breed evolved as alert dogs for Buddhist monks in monasteries, so their instinct is to bark whenever someone approaches the door. But, as you now know, their bark is worse than their bite!",

(If you choose to skip a day or two, your sessions will be longer.) Pay attention to extra debris that clings to the hair on their feet. Some people choose to cut the hair that grows between the pads on the underside of the foot to help with traction. These dogs shed far less than other breeds, but they start to \"blow their coat\"—they shed their hair in clumps in the spring and fall—when they hit adolescence (about 9 months old). Couple this with a thick double coat of fur for extra insulation, and you've got a dog who's prone to forming thick mats—and those mats can take hours to get out!\u003C/li\u003E\n \t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHair trimming:\u003C/strong\u003E If you want to lighten your grooming load, consider \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/home-pet-grooming-cheat-sheet\"\u003Ecutting the fur\u003C/a\u003E shorter.

Is your dog sitting on the sofa most of the time or traipsing through the woods by your side? Is their hair long or cut shorter?

If you're new to being a pet parent, ask your vet to teach you how best to brush. Starting when they're puppies will help them get used to it more quickly.

Lots of walking on concrete or other rough surfaces is more likely to wear them down compared to a homebody who's mostly walking on plush carpeting. That said, the Tibetan Terrier's flat feet may make their nails wear down less quickly than other breeds. The best approach is to tune into the sound your dog makes when they walk. If you hear a tell-tale clicking on the floor, that means their nails are too long and it's time for a trim. Most dogs need a nail trim about once a month.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
        "training": "The smart-witted and gentle Tibetan Terrier is a quick learner and eager to please. But fair warning: Their intelligence can lead them to ask, \"What's in it for me?\" So don't expect them to do what's asked just because their beloved pet parent is doing the asking. Remember that Tibetan Terriers respond much better to positive reinforcement and rewards. Think \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/training-treats-1550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etraining treats\u003C/a\u003E and affection in return for good behavior. Start training as soon as you bring your Tibetan Terrier puppy home; short bursts of up to 10 minutes each day should help to hold their concentration. At first, try some basic \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Eobedience commands\u003C/a\u003E, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E, and graduate to something more challenging like being taught to retrieve different toys by name.\n\nThis breed is also pretty strong-willed and tends to have a mind of their own if off-leash. If you don't want to go on a wild goose chase through the wilderness, it's wise to invest some additional time in recall training, aka teaching your pet to return to you, before you plan that hiking adventure. Again, start with the basics such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;and oodles of positive reinforcement.\n\nUnless your Tibetan Terrier has had a haircut, be sure to bring a barrette to training. Pinning their hair up and away from their face will help ensure they can see you and the trainer under all that fur—and help your Tibetan Terrier focus better on the task in hand.\n\nThe Tibetan Terrier is very friendly but can come across as pretty standoffish and aloof to house guests. You can make these interactions easier for your beloved dog by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/positively-trained-puppy-socialization-dos-and-donts\"\u003Esocializing\u003C/a\u003E them at a young age so they are happy to meet and greet and welcome new friends with a wag of their gloriously luscious tail.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Every dog needs a complete and balanced diet. The Tibetan Terrier typically does well on a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/premium-food-11728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E. When choosing a variety, be sure choose one that fits your dog's age and stage in life (puppy, adult or senior).\r\n\r\nAs the holy dogs in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, the Tibetan Terrier often ate leftover gruel (like cooked barley). So be sure that whatever food you choose contains some whole grains. That'll help keep their heart happy, too.\r\n\r\nTo prevent your pup from gaining too much weight, putting them at risk for health conditions, like heart disease and diabetes, keep treats to a minimum—and resist the urge to give into those big eyes and share your dinner with them.\r\n\r\nBecause the energetic Tibetan Terrier tends to be lean and attuned to their needs, you can often (though not always!) trust them to eat what they need—provided you resist their pleas and stick to commercial dog food. However, be sure to ask your vet for information and advice on the best food and feeding schedule for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Lace up your walking shoes—the Tibetan Terrier dog needs regular exercise, so plan on dedicating an hour throughout the day. While \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/leash-train-dog-2\"\u003Estrolling through town on a leash\u003C/a\u003E is great, running in a fenced area, frolicking in the snow or hiking in the hills can help a hyper pup burn off steam. But be aware that the independent and mildly rambunctious Tibetan Terrier may have a mind of their own when it comes to being off-leash. So if you venture into the wilderness, don't let your dog off-leash until you're completely certain your dog will return when called. Otherwise, you may end up embarking on an unplanned adventure.\n\nDo you have a bit of a competitive streak? If so, you and your pup may enjoy participating in dog sports, like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-agility-training-tips\"\u003Eagility\u003C/a\u003E, rally and nose work. Not only will you and your Tibetan Terrier have fun participating in these sports together, you may just come home with some fancy 1st place ribbons.\n\nWhen you're planning your daily exercise, don't forget to work out their brains as well as their bodies. Tibetan Terriers are smart, and some mental stimulation with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/puzzle-toys-games-2335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle toys\u003C/a\u003E will help youngsters burn off some of their excess energy.",
        "ideal_environment": "The Tibetan Terrier is a very adaptable dog and is a great fit for a first-time pet parent. This breed is good for apartment-dwellers but will also be delighted with a large home, especially if it comes with big fenced-in yard to run around in. While they're happy romping in the snow and rambling through the hills, they also do well as a mostly indoor family dog.\r\n\r\nTibetan Terriers are great with kids and good with other dogs and pets, too, so maybe you can finally live the dream and set up that menagerie at home! Entertaining is a walk in the park, too, as this is a very friendly breed. These dogs can be aloof with people they don't know, but you can help to ease your dog into meeting and greeting humans by socializing them from an early age.\r\n\r\nFor the Tibetan Terrier breed, winter is their season, and they love to frolic in the snow. With their double coat, including the soft, wooly undercoat and their fine outer coat, they have the built-in insulation needed to weather the winter elements.

        "h2_breed_history": "Often called the \"Holy Dog of Tibet,\" the Tibetan Terrier is an ancient breed with a long history. The breed evolved over 2,000 years ago as a watchdog and good luck charm for Buddhist monasteries on the cold, wind-swept plains of Tibet. With their wise eyes, sensitivity and slightly mischievous nature, it's easy to imagine that this luck bringer connected, somehow, to the Dali Lama himself!\r\n\r\nBecause they were originally bred as companions and watchdogs for monks, they make devoted companions for modern pet parents, even if you're sitting on the sofa rather than a zafu.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan Terrier first came to the West thanks to a British surgeon, Dr. Agnes Greig, who lived in northern India in the 1920s. After performing life-saving surgery on a Tibetan woman, Dr. Greig received a Tibetan Terrier as a thank you gift. She became so enamored of her dog—and really, who wouldn't?—that she started her own breeding program when she returned to England. By the 1950s, two dogs from her program were brought to the US, and by 1973, the American Kennel Club (AKC) had recognized the Tibetan Terrier.\r\n\r\nSo what's the best way to bring a Tibetan Terrier into your life? Start with a reputable breeder on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/tibetan-terrier?breed=257&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAKC's website\u003C/a\u003E or contact one of the 16 breeders (yes, just 16!) listed with the \u003Ca href=\"https://ttca-online.org/\"\u003ETibetan Terrier Club of America\u003C/a\u003E. The cost of a Tibetan Terrier puppy from a reputable breeder is around $2,500—but the value of bringing one into your life is priceless. For that price you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also adopt a dog through a \u003Ca href=\"https://ttca-online.org/tts-in-rescue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ETibetan Terrier rescue program\u003C/a\u003E, or search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-tibetan-terrier_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",
