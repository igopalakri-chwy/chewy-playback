        "h2_breed_temperament": "\"A nose with a dog attached\" is a common way to describe a Bloodhound. Their sense of smell is extraordinary, and their nose is what they use to navigate the world around them. This trait can't be trained out of them; your Bloodhound has access to an entire world that you can't see (or smell), and they will go where their nose takes them.\n\nWhen not in hot pursuit of a scent, the Bloodhound breed can be laid-back members of the family. But just like people, their personalities can differ: Some are so high-energy that they're seemingly always on the move, and others are happy to spend some downtime curled up on the rug. You can help them expend their energy by letting them romp by themselves in the backyard (as long as the yard is fenced). They're also eager to go on hikes or walks with you. Just remember, when they catch a scent, \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E stands in their way—and they are off! (They look like they're at Mach speed when they go.) For this reason, make sure any dog walker (professional or pint size) has a firm grasp on the leash!\n\nWith their sturdy size and high energy levels, they may accidentally knock over toddlers, but their temperament is very low-key. While they get along great with other animals and people, they may sometimes be shy, so it's a good idea to start socializing your Bloodhound puppy while they're young.\n\nA Bloodhound can be slower to mature than other breeds. This isn't code for \"unintelligent,\" but it does mean that housebreaking and mastering commands (like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-sit\"\u003Esit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-stay\"\u003Estay\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/basic-dog-training-commands-come\"\u003Ecome\u003C/a\u003E) may take more time for them than other pups. Be consistent and kind and make sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to rules of the house—inconsistency will confuse a Bloodhound, and they may decide to make up their own rules instead. Bloodhounds do best when they know exactly what to expect from the people in their family.",

While not as high maintenance as a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/\"\u003EShih Tzu\u003C/a\u003E when it comes to grooming, they do require regular brushing, and you'll need to keep their loose skin and facial wrinkles clean. Their high energy and strong-willed nature also translate to a good deal of time spent training and exercising them, but not as much as, say, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/border-collie/\"\u003EBorder Collie\u003C/a\u003E. Of course, any time you spend with your Bloodhound is time well spent.",
        "grooming": "Let's get one thing out of the way: A Bloodhound smells like a dog. That's because their skin and coat have a greasy layer that helps repel dirt when they're trekking through the woods on a scent trail. While this scent is healthy and normal, it can be distinctive.\n\nFor that reason, you may find yourself giving your pup a bath more frequently. But really, they only need a bath whenever they're really dirty—about once every couple of months. They may need a bath more often in the summer or if they get dirty from playing outside. Use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/shampoos-2445\"\u003Edog shampoo\u003C/a\u003E, towel them off, and let them air dry as long as they don't seem cold. (Some Bloodhounds may have sensitive or dry skin, which may need special shampoo.) For more advice, read our \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/how-to-bathe-a-dog-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer\"\u003Eguide on how to give a dog a bath\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nEven though they're short-haired, Bloodhounds still shed, so it's a good idea to use a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/f/dog-grooming-gloves_c355_f70v83788\"\u003Egrooming glove\u003C/a\u003E every day to keep their coats in tip-top shape. Use a cotton swab to get rid of the gunk that accumulates in the folds around their eyes, and do a quick, daily wrinkle check in their face and neck folds to look for any skin irritation or odor, which could be a sign of an infection and may need a vet's attention.\n\nCheck your pup's extremely long ears every day, wiping away debris with an ear wipe, like the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/pet-md-aloe-vera-eucalyptus-dog-ear/dp/146683\"\u003EPet MD Aloe Vera &amp; Eucalyptus Dog Ear Wipes\u003C/a\u003E. If you notice redness, swelling or debris, speak with your vet; they may advise you to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/how-do-you-clean-a-dogs-ears-follow-this-vet-approved-step-by-step-guide\"\u003Eclean your dog's ears\u003C/a\u003E. Brown discharge is normal, but yellow, green or a foul-smelling discharge may be a sign of an infection.\n\nIt's a good idea to have plenty of towels on hand, too. Bloodhounds drool a lot, so get in the habit of regularly wiping their noses and chins to keep them (and your couch) dry.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/grooming/health-wellness-how-to-brush-your-dogs-teeth-live-to-tell-the-tale\"\u003EBrush your Bloodhound's teeth\u003C/a\u003E several times a week and get them professionally cleaned by your vet once a year. Start when they're a puppy to help them get used to it faster.\n\nYour dog will need their nails clipped once a month or so, either with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/nail-clippers-1430\"\u003Enail clippers\u003C/a\u003E or a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/dremel-7300-pt-dog-cat-nail-grinder/dp/156127\"\u003Egrinder\u003C/a\u003E. This chore, too, should start when they're puppies to help them get used to it. Otherwise, you'll need to enlist the help of a \"grooming buddy\" (or grow a third arm—whichever's easier). You'll know it's \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/health-and-wellness/guide-trimming-dogs-nails\"\u003Etime for a trim\u003C/a\u003E when you hear that familiar clicking on hard surfaces.",
        "training": "Bloodhounds can be very strong-willed; training these pups isn't for the faint of heart! When you start training your dog, get a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/b/harnesses-347\"\u003Egood, sturdy harness\u003C/a\u003E since they're likely to pull during training. A harness is more secure, and there's less of a risk for injury than just attaching the leash to a collar. (The collar can pull against the neck, causing injury to the trachea.)\n\nBloodhound puppies (under six months or so) can learn the \"rules of school\" in puppy kindergarten, which can teach them socialization as well as learning basic commands, or you can put your 6-month-and-up pup straight into \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/sit-stay-and-beyond-weve-got-the-essential-guide-to-basic-dog-obedience-training\"\u003Ebasic obedience training\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nYour mantra: Slow and steady wins the race. Your Bloodhound wants to please you, but how can they pay attention when there's so many interesting smells in the air? Your secret weapon: short training sessions (about 10 to 15 minutes). And make sure everyone in your family is on board with the rules and agrees on the cue you'll use for different commands. (For example, \"come,\" not \"here\" and \"sit,\" not \"place,\" etc.). Start introducing these commands one at a time and in order of importance. Save more fun commands like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/dog-commands-shake-a-paw\"\u003Eshake\u003C/a\u003E and play dead when your dog has mastered the basics like come, sit, stay and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/training-and-behavior/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-heel\"\u003Eheel\u003C/a\u003E.\n\nTraining may be slow-going (after all, these are independent and free-thinking pups!), but stick with it. Training is essential to having a well-behaved furry family member and can divert potentially destructive urges into something constructive. Keep them learning throughout their life with the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/\"\u003ECanine Good Citizen program\u003C/a\u003E, competition courses (like agility) and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/sports/rally/\"\u003Erally training\u003C/a\u003E. These are fun for both you and your dog.",
        "diet_nutrition": "Bloodhounds really love food, but because they are prone to tummy issues, it's important you pay attention to what your pup eats. Bloodhounds do best on a quality and well-balanced diet, including \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog/food-and-nutrition/your-complete-guide-to-the-best-high-quality-dog-food\"\u003Ehigh-quality commercial dog food\u003C/a\u003E that follows the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. It's also important to remember that a Bloodhound can \u003Cem\u003Eeasily \u003C/em\u003Efind food in your house (hello, super nose!), so make sure all of your food is stored safely out of their reach. Bloodhounds can figure out how to open cabinets and even fridges, so keep an eye on your pup. You need to find a way to secure delicious food \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003Ethey help themselves to those steaks you were saving in the deep freeze.\n\nObesity can be a problem for Bloodhounds, so take any weight gain seriously and talk with your vet even if your pup is only a pound or two overweight. They can help you put together a diet and exercise plan to help your pup shed the excess pounds and still maintain their nutritional needs. Some Bloodhounds have food allergies that manifest as itchy or dry skin, so again, talk with your vet about your dog's diet; they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your Bloodhound based on their individual needs.\n\nNow, let's talk about treats. (Those calories count!) Your dog's soulful eyes can be hard to resist, and consistent training means plenty of treats. Bloodhounds are very food motivated, so consider switching up your treats and include lower-calorie options that still excite your pup. Some human food—pieces of apple, celery, frozen blueberries or pieces of cooked egg—are all ways to say \"good dog\" while keeping your Bloodhound in hunting shape. (Even if the only \"hunt\" they've been on recently was finding a stinky shoe.)",
        "exercise": "While a Bloodhound's energy level is high, it's not always high—it ebbs and flows. When they're on a scent trail, nothing can stop them, and they can run for miles. But Bloodhounds also enjoy their downtime. Their daily exercise needs depend on their personality: Some dogs are always on the go and need to be taught to take a break; others take their cue from you and may relax more.\r\n\r\nIn general, you need at least an hour of solid outdoor time every day (yup, even rainy ones) with your Bloodhound. Are you a jogger? Active Bloodhounds can keep up with you (and you may actually tire them out), but make sure your leash control is solid. (They \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E catch a scent!) Bloodhounds also love playing fetch and other outdoor games and make great dog park companions. A tired Bloodhound is a happy Bloodhound, so make sure your pup has plenty of opportunities to move throughout the day. These should include running or walking sessions with you and less-structured romps in the backyard or the dog park.",
        "ideal_environment": "Bloodhounds get along in any type of family—whether single people or people with kids—as long as they're active. And these pups love a crowd, so a family with a pack of dogs or cats is ideal.\r\n\r\nBloodhound dogs need a fenced-in space to roam. They love exploring the outdoors, but if they catch a scent, nothing else matters. They won't let it go until they track down the source—sometimes running for miles. Off-leash play in an unfenced area is not an option for this uber-focused pup.\r\n\r\nBloodhounds can be friendly, but they're not necessarily outgoing and are much more likely to ignore visitors than jump all over them. Bloodhounds bark and bay when they notice something, and while training can help them tame their commentary, these dogs will never be the strong and silent type, so they may be best suited for rural settings, where they can bark, drool and run without bothering anyone else.",

        "h2_breed_history": "We know very little about the Bloodhound's early origins, but it likely begins around the Mediterranean, where ancient Greeks were in awe of their superior sniffing powers. But their name and distinctive look took root in Medieval Europe, where the Bloodhound history \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Ebegins.\r\n\r\nThese working dogs were essential members of a hunting pack, and they were bred and treated with reverence on the grounds of medieval French monasteries. Bred by monks, these dogs were originally called \"blooded hounds\" because they came from aristocratic families. (For the rest of us who watch too many movies, no, they did not get their names because they're quick to pick up a trail of blood in the woods.) Later, their name evolved into \"Bloodhounds.\" It is believed that William the Conqueror brought these pups with him from Normandy when he conquered England in 1066.\r\n\r\nThe pup's potential for police work did not go unnoticed. By the turn of the 19th century, English police units began using these nose-first pups to find criminals. Law enforcement agencies around the world took notice, and today, a Bloodhound's trailing results are acceptable in almost any court of law. Bloodhounds were used by police departments throughout the 20th century, but over time, they became less popular as police forces turned to \"multi-use\" breeds such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/education/dog-breeds/german-shepherd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGerman Shepherds\u003C/a\u003E, which, in addition to tracking, can be trained to provide personal protection and backup.\r\n\r\nBut because Bloodhounds are good with kids, they can be excellent in search-and-rescue cases, as they pose little threat to the people they find. The American Kennel Club recognized the Bloodhound in 1885 and is part of the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/hound/\"\u003EHound group\u003C/a\u003E. Today, you can expect to pay $600 to $1,200 or more for a purebred Bloodhound puppy. But for that price, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can find reputable breeders on the \u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/bloodhound\"\u003EAKC's site\u003C/a\u003E. If you'd like to adopt your pup, contact Bloodhound rescues, look for the breed at your local animal shelter, or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-bloodhound_ga1\"\u003Esearch Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs\u003C/a\u003E in your area.",
