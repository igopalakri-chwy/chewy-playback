They thrive in environments where they can be physically and mentally active, so if you've ever wanted to see a tiny dog crush an agility course, raising a Brussels Griffon is right up your alley.\r\n\r\nThese \"Velcro dogs\" want nothing more than to be with their special person.

(Positive reinforcement uses treats, praise and playtime to reward your pup for doing a good job.) Formal training classes can be be useful in training and something to consider. What won't work so well are harsh words and raised voices which can be counter-productive considering their sensitive nature.

If you have questions about your Brussels Griffon dog's food, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
        "exercise": "Don't let the diminutive stature of a Brussels Griffon fool you into thinking these pups are docile little lapdogs. They have a high energy level, along with deceptive speed, and will need time to frolic and play at least once a day for 30 minutes to really stretch their legs. Griffons enjoy energetic walks as well as slower walks that allow them time to explore the world through their nose. If you have a competitive streak, you and your pup may enjoy dog sports, like agility or tracking.\r\n\r\nThese toy dogs were originally bred as hunters for mice and vermin, and any activity that lets them track or hunt will be a delight for your pup. For example, you can hide treats under an old Chewy box and let them hunt for the snack.

They do well in smaller homes, like apartments, because of their small size, as long as they have outlets for their energy.  They also do well with cats and dogs, and can be good family dogs with children who respect tehir boundaries. What they aren't flexible on?

(The coachmen and stablemen who had a hand in the breeding didn't keep clear records).\r\n\r\nThese small dogs are tiny but mighty and originally bred as ratters, i.e., to keep rats and other small vermin out of stables. Around 1870, however, history notes they got a boost out of the stables and into the lap of luxury when Queen Henrietta Maria of Belgium couldn't resist the smushed faces of the Brussels Griffon breed and made them a household name. That also paved the way for official recognition by the American Kennel Club (AKC), which registered the first Brussels Griffon in 1910. In 1982, the \u003Ca href=\"https://abga.club/about-abga/club-history/\"\u003EAmerican Brussels Griffon Association\u003C/a\u003E was elected to AKC membership.\r\n\r\nWhile their origin moved quickly up the ranks from stable to castle, today's dogs are most known for their pouty faces and loving, longing eyes that people can't seem to resist. And their intelligence and playfulness make them stars—literally! If this sweet pup's face seems familiar, and you're a fan of Jack Nicholson films, you may recognize the Brussels Griffon as the dog who stole the show in the movie \"As Good As It Gets.\"\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find Brussels Griffon puppies today?

What's the average Brussels Griffon price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend about $1,500 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Brussels Griffon rescue organizations to adopt one of these pups, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search \u003Ca href=\"https://www.chewy.com/g/dog-brussels-griffon_ga1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EChewy's database for adoptable Brussels Griffons\u003C/a\u003E in your area..",
