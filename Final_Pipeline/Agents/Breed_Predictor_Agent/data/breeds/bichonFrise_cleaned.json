  "breed_intro": "A Bichon Frise is your No. 1 fan. Seriously. They think everything you do is the most interesting thing in the world—even if it's just pouring cereal. (Nobody does it better!) Bichons stick by you through thick and thin. They're there for you through a break up, and they're there for you when you'd rather have a little privacy. Even though they may be a little Velcro-y at times, their trademark charm will win you over. Plus, they're as smart as a whip. (They were once circus performers!) A Bichon Frise will have you putting away that mix tape in no time because, really, you'd rather spend your time laughing with your pup anyway.",
  "appearance_description": "Known for their white \"powder puff\" coat and curious expression, the Bichon Frise dog breed can easily hide in a sea of stuffed animals. (They often look like little white teddy bears!) A Bichon's long tail curls over their back; and their deep, dark eyes reflect their intelligent nature. Even though they weigh under 20 pounds, their sturdy and compact frame gives them a hearty look and feel.",
  "temperament_description": "If the movie biz was composed entirely of canines, the Bichon Frise would win a People's Choice Award. Their charming personality effortlessly captures everyone's attention, including other pups. The Bichon is a lover, not a fighter and wants to engage with other people and pets. Smart with plenty of emotional intelligence, a Bichon can be adept to navigating the needs of people around them—especially if trained and socialized at an early age.\n\nThe Bichon Frise dog breed is great with kids and babies and can happily spend the morning romping with toddlers in the backyard. Later in the day, they're content to spend hours curled on the lap of your great grandma. In fact, it's this calming characteristic that makes them great emotional support and therapy dogs.\n\nVelcro dog alert: Bichons do not like to be left alone for long (their name does mean \"curly lapdog,\" after all), but that doesn't mean you need to entertain them 24/7. (It does mean you can say goodbye to peaceful soaks in the bathtub.) They need to have people around during the day.",
  "care_description": "Small and hearty with a long lifespan, Bichons are a delightful addition to your family. Yes, that powder-puff coat requires a lot of maintenance, but their grooming time is perfectly balanced by their low exercise and average training needs.",
  "grooming_description": "The curly, double coat of the Bichon Frise is their crowning glory. Fortunately for you, shedding is not the problem. However, that beautiful coat can create matting problems if left unchecked. Here are some grooming tips for your Bichon Frise:\n\n \t• Brushing: It's important to establish a daily brushing routine to prevent matting and maintain an Insta-ready coat. Even a Bichon Frise puppy benefits from daily brushing, especially to acclimate to the routine. This can become a daily bonding time, which you both will love. Your grooming ritual will involve a slicker brush followed by a dog comb, like this Li'l Pals comb. You'll know you're done when the comb can glide through their coat.\nBathing: Your pup will need a bath every week or two, depending on how dirty they get. It's important to brush them out before bath time; any mats will just get tighter and more difficult to remove once they're wet. Use cold air to dry your dog to protect their skin.\nDental care: Plan on brushing your Bichon's teeth daily to keep them healthy and help prevent dental disease. Start brushing their teeth when your dog is a puppy to get them used to the feeling. Once a year, your vet should give them a professional cleaning.\nNail trimming: You'll also need to trim your pup's nails every month or so. You'll know it's time for a mani/pedi when you hear their nails clicking across hard surfaces. It can be a good idea to set aside an hour or so on the weekends to set up a Bichon spa to keep everything in shape, tip to tail.\nCoat trim: A Bichon's coat will need a trim about once a month, which, if you're up to it, you can probably do yourself. If you're not excited about trimming your pup's coat, find a great groomer. There are three main types of a Bichon Frise haircut:\n\n \t• The teddy bear cut: The teddy bear cut is when the fur is trimmed to the same length all over and is often rounded a bit on the head, giving the pup the trademark \"teddy bear\" look.\nThe utility cut: A utility cut is ideal for a low-maintenance pup; the hair is cut close to the skin but usually left longer on the ears.\nThe lamb cut: The lamb cut (aka the puppy cut) is when the fur is trimmed to a few inches from the skin and is left a little longer on the head and tail.\n\nWhile they're having their spa day, the groomer (or you, if you're into DIY) can also perform regular maintenance such as anal gland expression, which can be a necessary routine in smaller breeds.",
  "training_description": "Bichons are born performers. They are naturals at training and love learning new tricks. But their independent streak can make it a challenge for them to pick up on the basics, like house training, walking nicely on a leash and commands like sit, stay and come. Patience, consistency and rewards for good behavior will help ensure success (as will a good certified dog trainer, if you need assistance.)\n\nPotty training may be particularly challenging because Bichons have a small stature (and a tiny bladder). Again, positive reinforcement (where you reward your dog for good behavior) and consistency (sticking to a set schedule of frequent bathroom breaks) will go a long way to ensuring they go when and where they're supposed to.\n\nBichons do not like to be alone and small changes in your routine—such as spending a few too many hours out of the house—may result in unwanted behaviors like bathroom accidents, barking and chewing your shoes. Starting crate training early, where you teach your puppy to be comfortable and happy in their crate while alone, can help. To crate train:\n\n \t• First, you'll need to get them used to the crate in general (get the how-to here).\nThen, you can work on leaving them alone while they are in the crate. Begin with short intervals, like 5 minutes. Put your pup in the crate with a high-value treat or toy and leave the room.\nWhen you come back, calmly praise your pup for a job well done. If they cry or whine, start with a shorter time.\nDo this daily, gradually increasing the time you're away.\n\nSome Bichons may never be OK with you being gone for long. In that case, consider hiring a dog walker or sending them to doggy daycare on the days you're out of the house for more than a few hours.\n\nWhile your Bichon may be your BFF, beware of a side effect: a Bichon may take those \"we're equal\" vibes as an opportunity to get their way, which can look like nudges, extra licks and extra barks. The trick is to subtly teach your dog that you're in charge. One thing that can help is to make sure that your praise (like saying, \"Good pup!\") is meaningful. Smartypants Bichons easily connect words to actions, and if you're constantly using pet names—even when all they're doing is lounging on the couch—can minimize the importance of the words you use when they do matter. Make sure you use positive reinforcement whenever they do something good and redirect any unwanted behavior to something positive, rather than caving to every inopportune knee nuzzle with a cuddle.\n\nNurture your Bichon's intelligence and love of learning by teaching them new tricks throughout their lives. A Bichon enjoys mastering a new skill, so regularly set aside time for training. (They learn a new skill, and they get to spend more time with you—it's a win-win!)",
  "diet_nutrition": "Because a Bichon is so small, every calorie counts; and it's important they get optimum nutrition with every meal. Your vet is in the best position to help you choose the most appropriate food and feeding plan for your pet, based on their age and activity level.\n\nSome Bichon families want to meet their pup's nutritional needs by DIY-ing their meals with a mixture of meat, dairy products, fruits, veggies and potatoes, but check with your vet to make sure your meals have the proper nutrition breakdown. There are plenty of commercial options that are convenient for you and good for your Bichon, too. Look on the packaging for a statement that says the food meets the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) standards for a complete and balanced diet.\n\nA Bichon's diet is often reflected in the way their skin and coat look and feel. Itchy, dry skin or a lank, dull coat may be early signs that your pup's diet isn't ideal. Keep an eye out for these signs during your regular grooming sessions. If you suspect a problem, talk to your veterinarian.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for how is many treats you're feeding. It's tempting to reward a Bichon frequently, even for just being cute, but the breed can be prone to obesity and treats quickly add up calorie-wise. Small morsels of healthy treats—think frozen blueberries or small pieces of cut-up fruits and veggies—can be good options. Dehydrated meat-based treats are also healthy in moderation, but make sure to keep treats in check.",
  "exercise_description": "A Bichon Frise may never compete in a marathon (unless we're talking a Netflix bingefest with you), but that doesn't mean the breed is a couch potato. The Bichon Frise is a naturally fast runner (you'll be surprised by their speed!), so beware if you let an untrained Bichon off-leash.\r\n\r\nYou can fulfill their exercise needs with small \"movement breaks\" throughout the day (about 30 minutes a day). This may include regular walks around the neighborhood once or twice a day, a few low-key fetch sessions and some time to sniff around the backyard or a nearby park. You can pull double-duty with the training and engage their brains and their bodies by participating in agility courses or obedience trials.",
  "ideal_environment": "Good news, city dwellers! The Bichon Frise easily adapts to apartment living. They are friendly with your neighbors, don't bark a lot and don't need a lot of exercise. They do love to sniff and explore the outdoors, so make time for regular outdoor walks (or time to run around the backyard or dog park) to keep your Bichon happy and in shape. The most important factor for Bichons is time with the humans who matter to them the most. They thrive in homes where someone will be with them throughout the day.",
  "health_description": "Bichons are a hearty breed with a relatively long lifespan of 14-15 years, but like any breed, they are prone to certain illnesses. It’s important to know what these health issues are in advance, so you can help your pup live a full and active life. \n\n \t• Luxating patella: Bichon Frises can be prone to a condition called luxating patella, in which the knee cap moves out of place. Over time, this can damage cartilage and result in pain and a reduction of movement. Environmental factors, such as obesity, can worsen this sometimes-genetic condition. Treatment may include medication or surgery, depending on the severity. \n \t• Eye Problems: Bichon Frises are prone to cataracts, leading to blindness as your dog gets older. While surgery is an option if your dog develops cataracts, many dogs can adjust to blindness, especially in one eye. Frequent vet visits can help monitor any slow-developing vision problems. Bichons are also susceptible to distichiasis, a condition where an eyelash grows inward toward the eye, causing irritation and pain. Treatments can vary from lubricating gels or ointments to surgery, depending on the severity. Corneal dystrophy, a condition that causes cloudiness in the outer layer of the eye, can also be seen in Bichons as early as 2 years of age. This condition is thought to be inherited and does not always require treatment. \n \t• Bladder Stones: Bladder stones are the fourth most-common disease for Bichons. They develop due to excess minerals in the urine. Just like with humans, bladder stones can be painful. Depending on the type and severity, treatment options range from a special diet to surgery. If you see your dog urinating more often, straining while urinating or licking their genitals more frequently, talk to your vet. \n \t• Liver Problems: Bichons are prone to a liver disorder called portosystemic shunt (PSS). In PSS, the blood supply is diverted from the liver, resulting in toxin buildup over time. Medication, monitoring and surgery are all ways to deal with this condition. \n \t• Diabetes Mellitus: Bichon Frises are more prone to developing diabetes mellitus than some other dog breeds. This condition occurs when the pancreas fails to produce adequate insulin and results in elevated blood sugar levels. Because diabetes has the potential to be life-threatening, it is vital to monitor for this disease on a regular basis, and pay close attention to any changes in thirst, appetite or weight as your Bichon ages. \n\nUse your grooming time each week to assess your Bichon’s overall health. Take note of anything unusual or any unusual behaviors. Conditions diagnosed and treated early may have better outcomes and may have less invasive treatment options, including monitoring, medication and diet modification.",
  "history_description": "The Bichons have a history full of folklore that would make for a fascinating drama—their origins are shrouded in mystery. (Are they Egyptian? Maybe Greco-Roman.) Regardless, it's widely believed a popular, small white dog is the ancestor to the modern Bichon. (Side note: These dogs were so desirable, they were often used for bartering—apparently even Cleopatra adored the \"little white dog\"!)\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that the Bichon began their journey to becoming the dog we love today on the Canary Islands (Tenerife, to be precise). There, the four \"cousins\" (Havanese, Maltese, Bolognese and Bichon) were developed and called barbichons. The Bichon, so closely tied to the island, was known as the Tenerife Bichon.\r\n\r\nAround the 13th century, Bichon Frises were brought to the European mainland and were the delight of royal courts across the continent; you often see them in paintings from the Renaissance era. It's been said that King Henry III of France was so taken with the breed, he carried a few with him everywhere in a shallow basket suspended by neck ribbons! (Truly, the Bichon was the \"it\" accessory of the day.)\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, as revolutions swept the world, the Bichon breed became collateral damage. Instead of living in palaces, they were living on the street. But don't fret! This is not where our story ends. Street performers found that the Bichon's winning personality and quick-study intellect made them ideal performing partners. Soon, these plucky pups graced European circuses with their delightful presence.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, Bichons again became collateral damage to global forces. Both world wars shook Europe, reducing the demand for circus dogs. The breed faced extinction, but Bichon lovers found surviving dogs and led the charge for modern breed recognition. In 1933, France's Societe Centrale Canine coined the Bichon breed \"Bichon a Poil Frise,\" meaning \"Bichon of the curly hair.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1956, Bichons made their way to California, and the Bichon Frise Club of America was founded in 1964. The American Kennel Club added them to the Miscellaneous class in 1971 (dogs on their way to AKC status), and they received their full breed recognition in 1973.\r\n\r\nWant to add a Bichon Frise as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC website. A Bichon Frise puppy can cost between $600-$1,000. But for that, you usually get a dog screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also look for the breed at local Bichon Frise rescues or animal shelters (a great way to give a fully grown Bichon some much-needed love!). You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area. Don't forget to include regular grooming as part of your \"Bichon budget\" as well as other expenses such as vet visits, food and treats.\r\n\r\nSometimes unscrupulous breeders will use terms to charge you more money for a puppy. The AKC does not recognize \"teacup Bichon Frises.\" These tiny dogs were often bred for the recessive dwarf gene. While they may look cute, these dogs may actually have more health issues down the road than a normal Bichon would. Also, if anyone tries to sell you a \"rare\" black Bichon—run. It's possible the pup is a Poochon (Bichon-Poodle mix), but a purebred Bichon is always white.",
