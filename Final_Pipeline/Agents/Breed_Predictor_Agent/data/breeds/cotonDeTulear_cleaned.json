  "breed_intro": "Don't like to be alone? Good news: The Coton de Tulear doesn't, either. Sociable, bubbly and cute as a button, Cotons never heard of personal space. Bred as companions for royals in Madagascar, Cotons de Tulear will follow you everywhere, bathroom included, filling your lap with a soft white ball of fluff at every opportunity. It's just your Coton doing their Coton thing. You'll quickly be too enamored by their witty humor and sweet personalities to let their clinginess get to you. When they forget they're dogs and try to \"talk\" to you like a human, even showing their teeth in a pleased-to-greet-you smile, you might even talk back (hey, we all do it). While they're energetic and enjoy their playtime, Cotons de Tulear are also content to curl up and cuddle while you work. Just don't leave them behind when it's time for a coffee break—these charmers will ensure the drive-thru barista never forgets your name again.",
  "appearance_description": "Cotons de Tulear may look more like stuffed animals than anything else, but rest assured, they are real dogs—ones who just happen to be the perfect size to pick up and hug close while you bury your face in all that fluffy, white hair. Their sweet faces and intelligently playful expressions will make you fall instantly in love. When in motion, Cotons look like little clouds floating along with their long coats sweeping the ground and their jaunty tails leaving a wispy jet stream of hair in their wake.",
  "temperament_description": "Cotons du Tulear are happy, easy-going and lovable, with a talent for charming the pants off people. They were bred to be your canine BFFs, and they take that job seriously (it may, in fact, be the only thing they do take seriously). With their comedic sense of timing, good humor and the way they try to \"talk\" to you with their human-like vocalizations, Cotons will keep your loneliness at bay and bring sunshine to even your gloomiest days.\r\n\r\nAlthough they're not yappy like some small dogs, Cotons will bark to let you know someone's at the door or in the yard. But don't expect them to make good watchdogs unless you prefer your burglars to be greeted with kisses. Cotons are way more bark than bite, and once they've told you company's arrived, they'll rush to be the first to welcome the newcomers with sweet, slobbery greetings.\r\n\r\nThese bubbly extroverts love meeting new people and also get along well with other dogs and cats. If you can't be home most of the day or take your Coton with you when you leave, a pet sibling will soothe their loneliness and help prevent separation anxiety. Cotons de Tulear get along great with kids of all ages, which make them terrific family dogs.\r\n\r\nCotons' eagerness to please makes them obedient and easy to train. They also do well in agility and conformation (dog show) sports. But while they have a lot of energy to burn, they're not hyper, and it doesn't take much to tire them out. They're really happiest just keeping you company and following you around all day. Sure, your therapist might accuse them of being co-dependent, but you'll be too charmed to care.",
  "care_description": "Cotons de Tulear require moderate care in terms of their exercise needs and are generally easy to train, yet they are pretty high maintenance when it comes to grooming. But all the time you'll spend brushing your Coton will strengthen your bond with them, and their positive attitudes will make it a joyful experience for you both. Besides, it's not just that they're good sports about grooming; they're also a breeze to care for in every other way.",
  "grooming_description": "Cotons need a lot of grooming and maintenance compared to other dog breeds. Here are some grooming tips for your Coton:\n\n \t• Brushing: You'll need to brush your Coton's coat once a day with a slicker or pin brush to smooth it out and prevent mats from forming. If tangles do occur, a metal comb and a conditioning grooming spray and detangler can help make removing them easy and painless.\nHair trimming: If you're planning to enter your Coton in dog shows, their coat will have to stay natural and unclipped, which will mean more maintenance. To keep their hair out of their eyes and make their adorable face easier to see, you can use a hair elastic to secure the stragglers in a high pony tail on top of their head. Don't worry, this works for female and male dogs alike. If you won't be showing your Cotie, you can make things easier by giving them a puppy clip, in which the hair is trimmed to one or two inches all over. Of course, there's a tradeoff—you'll have to make monthly visits to the groomer to maintain their haircut.\nBathing: On the plus side, Cotons don't shed much, although they do lose some hair around springtime. They're considered a hypoallergenic breed, but with light seasonal shedding, they're not completely risk-free for those who are allergic to dogs. Weekly bathing with a whitening shampoo will help cut down on allergens while keeping their coats vibrant and more manageable. After bathing, you'll want to avoid rubbing with a towel, because that can create knots in their hair. Instead pat your pup dry before giving them a blowout with a brush and hair dryer on low heat. Spa day, every day.\nDental care: Brush your dog's teeth daily. Your vet can teach you how to do it properly. Even though they'll lose their baby teeth, it's still best to start this habit when they're puppies and get them used to it early. As a small breed, Cotons are particularly prone to periodontal disease and dental problems associated with small mouths that crowd the teeth; so it's important to practice good daily dental hygiene and to visit your vet once a year for a professional cleaning.\nNail trimming: Trim your pup's nails once or twice a month. As soon as you hear their nails tapping on hard surfaces, you'll know they're due for a trim.",
  "training_description": "Cotons are not only incredibly bright, but they also live to make you happy, taking the term “people pleaser\" to a whole new level—all of which means training them is a joy.\n\nTraining starts from the time you begin raising a Coton de Tulear puppy. They can learn a lot through socialization and early exposure to being brushed and groomed. While the Coton de Tulear is generally the gregarious type, the more they're exposed as puppies to lots of different people, pets and situations—using treats to keep things positive—the more social and easy-going they'll be when they grow up.\n\nCotons love treats, which makes it easy to train them by rewarding desirable behaviors while ignoring those you don't like. They'll quickly intuit what makes you happy and what makes you less than pleased with them, and will keep doing the things that please you to earn a bite of kibble. There's no need to use any kind of punishment or to speak harshly to your Cotie—they learn best through consistent repetition and positive reinforcement: treats, toys and praise for job well done.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Coton de Tulear typically does well on a high-quality commercial dog food, like Halo small breed dog food. Whatever food you choose, check the packaging for a statement that says the food meets nutritional standards set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) to make sure you're purchasing a complete and balanced product. It's also key to choose a formula that fits your dog's stage in life, whether puppy, adult or senior. There is no standard feeding chart, but your veterinarian can help you determine the best food and diet, including serving size and feeding schedule, based on your dog's age, weight and activity level.\n\nLike with many small breeds, parents of the Coton de Tulear breed need to be on guard against pet obesity. Be sure to factor calories from treats into their daily food allotment, and don't let yourself get charmed into giving your Coton extra treats. This will take practice; charm comes standard on all Cotons. Again, talk to your vet, who will be in the best position to help you pick the right food and treats for your dog's individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Cotons have a moderate energy level—they're not hyperactive, but they're not couch potatoes, either. They need about 30 minutes of exercise each day. They enjoy meandering walks and can go about half a mile—more than that and you'll end up carrying them home. Coton de Tulear dogs are also sensitive to heat thanks to their thick coats, so you'll need to walk them during the cooler parts of the day when it gets really steamy outside and carry them over hot pavement to protect their tender paws.\n\nThey also love to play games like fetch and chase. If you have a fenced yard, or even a spacious living room or long hallway, they can get a lot of exercise by engaging with you in vigorous play a few times daily. This daily mental and physical engagement is essential. The Coton de Tulear's intelligence level makes them easily bored, and their favorite way to alleviate boredom when left to their own devices is to chew everything in sight. Bought new shoes recently? Upgraded your rug? Good for you—but if you want to keep your new things in good condition, be sure to schedule time for play and exercise to tire your Coton out. Fortunately, they love toys, so keeping them supplied with interactive dog toys will help occupy them when you don't have time to do the entertaining yourself.",
  "ideal_environment": "Cotons are energetic social butterflies who hate to be alone. They get along great with kids, thrive in households with pet siblings to keep them company and do best as part of a family in a home with a fenced yard where they can run and play. They can be good apartment dwellers, too, as long as they get walked a couple of times a day. Spacious apartments with plenty of room for them to speed around are best.\r\n\r\nMost of all, Cotons need a pet parent who isn't gone for long stretches and who is happy to have a little white puffball shadowing them around the house and warming their laps all day. The Coton de Tulear breed is ideal for a family with a stay-at-home or work-from-home parent. If you love hosting gatherings of friends, your Coton will be the evening's party favor. These pups love to be the center of attention and will put on a good show (they've even been known to walk on their hind legs) to entertain your guests.\r\n\r\nWhile Cotons are good swimmers, their thick coats can become saturated and weigh them down, putting them at risk for drowning. If you have a pool, you'll need to keep their hair cut short for their safety or keep them away from the water unless they have a dog life jacket and close supervision.",
  "health_description": "Cotons de Tulear have a life expectancy of 15-19 years. They’re a generally healthy breed, but they may be susceptible to some conditions common to small breeds. It’s good to know what those potential health issues are in advance, so you can keep your pup healthy for longer. \r\n\n \t• Patellar Luxation: This condition causes the kneecap to move out of place. This can result in lameness and “bunny hopping,” which can be painful and lead to arthritis. Treatment ranges from joint supplements and pain medication to surgery, in severe cases.  \r\n \t• Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a genetic condition affecting vision that eventually leads to blindness. While there is no cure, there is a genetic screening test, so be sure to ask your breeder. Blind dogs can have a great quality of life if their pet parents make small lifestyle changes, including not rearranging the furniture.  \r\n \t• Degenerative Myelopathy (DM): A progressive weakness in the rear limbs, DM is a genetic condition that can result in paralysis. There is no cure for DM, but there is a genetic screening test, so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "The Coton de Tulear breed is named for two things: their cottony coat and the seaport town of Tulear in Madagascar from whence they came (their name literally translates to Cotton of Tulear). The Cotons of this island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa weren't just any old lapdog. They were the royal dog of Madagascar, their ownership restricted to the noble and ruling class.\r\n\r\nNot a lot is known about the origin of these little dogs or how they came to be on this island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. One popular theory is that some small, white dogs—possibly Maltese—survived a shipwreck and swam ashore where they lived in the wild and mated with local dogs. The island's elites fell in love with their fluffy offspring and began to breed them intentionally. For centuries they managed to keep these dogs their own little secret, until the 1960s when French tourists discovered the pups and brought these little dogs to Europe.\r\n\r\nTheir popularity exploded on the continent with breeders and dog fanciers alike; and in the '70s, Cotons made their way across the pond to North America. The official parent club, the United States of America Coton de Tulear Club, was formed in 1993. Even so, it wasn't until 2014 that the American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Cotons in the Non-Sporting group (for all dogs who don't neatly fit into one of the other categories).\r\n\r\nYou no longer have to be royalty to become a Coton parent, and you can find reputable Coton breeders on the AKC website. The cost of a Coton de Tulear puppy runs the royal price of $2,000-$3,000. For that, you typically get a pedigreed pup who's had vaccinations and health screenings. You can also check with Coton de Tulear rescue organizations for Cotons of all ages in need of good homes, or keep an eye out for this breed at your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Are Cotons de Tulear hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cotons de Tulear are considered hypoallergenic, just like their close relations, the Bichon Frise and the Maltese. This is because Cotons have coats of fine hair that don't shed much. Of course, there's no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic breed, but Cotons will be easier for mild allergy sufferers to live with than breeds who tend to shed more."
