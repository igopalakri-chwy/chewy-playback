  "breed_intro": "Sweet and charming with lots of energy, the Old English Sheepdog is just as content going on a jog with you through the neighborhood as they are competing in a herding trial. Give this fluffy pooch plenty of space with people who love them, and you're in for years of laughs and complete devotion—and possibly vacuum canisters full of fur. The Old English Sheepdog may need some extra love to maintain their hair, which just might be more luscious than yours, but their gentle disposition is worth the effort.",
  "appearance_description": "Old English Sheepdogs carry an intelligent expression, even if you can't see their eyes well under all that fur. They have a robust and compact build, and despite their thickset body, they're graceful and light-footed. When ambling along, they have the gait of a bear, bottoms swaying from side to side. They're usually shades of gray or blue with white.",
  "temperament_description": "Old English Sheepdogs are gentle and active and make great family dogs. They've been described as clownish, bounding goofily when excited, and have a zest for life while maintaining an even temperament. They can be protective, giving a distinct bark to head off strangers. Get in their zone of trust, though, and you'll have yourself a friendly, loyal, and devoted playmate.\r\n\r\nSocialization (introducing them to different people and experiences) is key to compatibility with others. Every dog is an individual, and temperament and personality will vary from dog to dog, but this breed generally can get along with young children with lots of exposure and positive reinforcement; otherwise, they may try to \"herd\" them or nip at them as they would with sheep. Children should also be taught how to respectfully play with dogs. The OES can get along with cats with early introductions and, again, the proper socialization. The same goes for other dogs—the more they're around other friends, the better they do. Luckily, they can be adaptable and easy-going, freely sharing their affection with their family.\r\n\r\nSheepdogs take their job as professional herders very seriously and love keeping busy, so ensure you're providing lots of opportunities for stimulation. They catch on quickly and can get bored with the same old commands, so mix it up a little during your training sessions.",
  "care_description": "Old English Sheepdogs need a pet parent with plenty of time to dedicate to caring for this energetic, lovable bundle of fur. Their plush double coats need considerable grooming. They shed all year round, too, so you'll need to up your vacuuming game. This intelligent breed can be strong-willed, so someone who understands them and knows how they tick will be their ideal trainer. Plan on lots of regular exercise, and don't be surprised if they enjoy practicing their herding skills on you.",
  "grooming_description": "The Old English Sheepdog has a thick double-layered coat. The outer coat is rougher, while the inner layer is softer and more dense. This coat can hold its ground in the harshest weather conditions, which came in handy in the fields centuries ago. Now, it's great for keeping cool and warm in the changing seasons.\n\nMaintaining that marvelous coat is not for the faint of heart. Sit down with some Netflix and various grooming tools—you can expect to spend three to four hours a week tending to your furry pal. Perhaps you can take up knitting with all the fur you'll brush out during each session. It's safe to say that daily brushing is necessary to keep the mats at a minimum and their skin healthy. Keep a comb, a pin brush, or a slicker brush at hand, and possibly a de-matting rake for stubborn tangles. Old English Sheepdogs are heavy shedders year-round and are prone to hot spots or red, irritated patches if their fur gets matted. Even more important than keeping your wood floors clear, brushing prevents the undercoat from clumping and keeps good airflow getting to the skin. \n\nCheck your Old English Sheepdog's eyes weekly (hiding under all that fur!) to make sure they look clear and bright, and keep the hair around their feet trimmed to prevent issues with traction on smoother surfaces and the dreaded matting. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears. \n\nBathe your OES about every six to eight weeks. If your pup spends lots of time outdoors, you'll want to give them extra long baths to really wash that coat. If they have sensitive skin or an allergy, make sure you're using a mild shampoo.\n\nAim to brush their teeth daily. Your veterinarian can work with you on how to do it, and it's best to start brushing when they're puppies so they'll get used to it faster. Like any dog, having good oral health habits is important to avoid problems down the road. You should also have an annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not your groomer).\n\nSince long nails can be painful for dogs to walk on, plan on giving them a nail trim every four to six weeks. Listen out for the tell-tale signs of tapping on the floor, a clear signal that it's time to get the clippers out.",
  "training_description": "When training an Old English Sheepdog puppy, it's important to remember they have a natural herding instinct. If you happen to have a flock in your backyard that needs herding, great. Otherwise, games such as hide-and-seek or Treibball can fulfill that characteristic herding instinct and may even prevent your dog from trying to herd around family members.\n\nOld English Sheepdogs are extremely intelligent, but they're also independent. This combination can make it a little harder to train, depending on your experience levels and your Old English Sheepdog's temperament. It takes them only a short time to learn commands like sit, stay and come, and then they're on to the next one, so the time spent on training will be a fun and rewarding experience for both of you.\n\nThe Old English Sheepdog can be nervous around groups of strangers, so it's a great idea to include some socialization training, including meeting and greeting people in and out of the home from a young age. They'll learn there's nothing to fear and only admiring glances and belly rubs to gain.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Old English Sheepdogs typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Dry dog food offers excellent nutrition and provides the necessary energy for such an active breed as the Old English Sheepdog.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, be mindful of those treats. They can add up to more calories than your pup needs in a day, leading to obesity and its related health risks, like heart disease and arthritis.\r\n\r\nChat with your vet if you have any questions about your pup's meals or frequency. They're in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their needs.",
  "exercise_description": "The Old English Sheepdog combines agility with strength. They may look bulky, but they can be fast on their feet. Speeding around a yard is great fun—and an open field is even better. Thankfully, these dogs can settle down after a vigorous workout and can make great couch potatoes after you've tired them out. It's really the best of both worlds, at least for your Sheepdog.\r\n\r\nDue to the Old English Sheepdog breed's energy levels and exercise needs, walking or running up to 60 minutes a day is a must to keep them out of mischief. A tired Sheepdog is a happy dog.\r\n\r\nSwimming can count as exercise, and these working dogs can swim. But whether they like it or not depends on if you introduce them to water at a young age. If you take them for a dip, make sure they are supervised and invest in a good quality dog life jacket.\r\n\r\nYour OES can make a great show dog, competing in sports such as agility or herding, so if you have a large outdoor space, why not set up some obstacles and start priming your dog for competition? You may come home with some fancy winning ribbons to show off.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Old English Sheepdog thrives with an experienced pet parent and one who loves to live an active lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a large dog with high energy levels, the Old English may not be happy living in an apartment or small home. The more space you can offer, the better for your dog, especially if you have a large fenced-in yard.\r\n\r\nOld English Sheepdogs can be nervous in some situations, so the children in their lives should be taught to play with them gently and respectfully. Cats and other pets, including other dogs, can certainly live together in harmony with the OES as long as there is the proper introduction and plenty of socialization opportunities.\r\n\r\nIf you entertain in your home, make sure your pup is well-socialized. If they're used to people, they tend to do great, but like any dog, suddenly immersing them in a crowded room when they aren't used to it can cause them to be fearful.\r\n\r\nThe Old English Sheepdog breed favors cooler climates because of their long, thick coat. They can get overheated easily, causing excessive panting and disorientation. If you're living in a place with warm weather, it may be time to build that covered porch or plunge pool.",
  "health_description": "Old English Sheepdogs have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years but are prone to a few health issues. A pet parent needs to know about the common health conditions that can affect their dog to help them live the longest life possible.\r\n\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: As with many large dog breeds, the Old English Sheepdog is at an increased risk for hip problems. In hip dysplasia, the ball and socket of the hip joint don’t fit correctly and can rub and grind against each other, leading to lameness, pain, stiffness, and eventually arthritis. Treatments vary depending on the severity but can include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, and surgery.\nEye Disease: The Old English Sheepdog is prone to eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, which can cause blindness if not treated; and progressive retinal atrophy, which can also lead to blindness and is untreatable. Entropion is a condition where the dog’s eyelid turns inwards, and the eyelashes rub against the eyeball, which irritates the cornea and causes discomfort. The treatment depends on the severity but can include pain medications or surgery.\nDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): The Old English Sheepdog is prone to DCM, which is a heart condition where the heart has trouble pumping blood to the body because the heart has grown enlarged and weakened. This is a genetic condition seen in larger dogs like the OES, and symptoms include trouble breathing, weakness and collapse. If your vet has concerns about your pet’s heart, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause.\nDeafness: Old English Sheepdog puppies can be prone to deafness, especially if they are all white. There is no treatment for deafness, but dogs with hearing issues can still live happy, healthy lives.\nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disease in which the thyroid glands do not produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms commonly include lethargy, weight gain, and hair loss. Diagnosis is typically by blood test and treatment is most often daily oral medication.",
  "history_description": "The Old English Sheepdog originated in the 1700s, so unlike their name, they aren't an ancient breed like the Xoloitzcuintli. They aren't fully English either—their ancestral history includes European, Scot, and Russian. The Scottish Bearded Collie might have played a role in this pup's development. And you know what else? They aren't even considered a sheepdog! Specifically, Old English Sheepdogs in the 18th century were known as \"drover's dogs\" as they helped move sheep and cattle long distances from the fields to the markets instead of herding them from the field to the barn like other sheepdog types. Fun fact: Their size, coloring, and shaggy fur helped them to blend in with sheep.\r\n\r\nAlso known as the Bobtail, this breed was promoted in the US by an industrialist from Pittsburgh around the time of their American Kennel Club recognition in 1888. Within 20 years, Old English Sheepdogs settled into the homes of five of the ten wealthiest American families, Vanderbilts and Guggenheims included.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, the OES won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The Old English Sheepdog also made it big in Hollywood with the 1959 Disney classic \"The Shaggy Dog.\" You probably have also seen this shaggy dog (in animated form) in \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"101 Dalmatians.\" The Old English Sheepdog is quite the movie star!\r\n\r\nLooking to add an Old English Sheepdog to your family? You can find reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website, where the average Old English Sheepdog puppy costs between $1,000 to $2,000. For that, you usually get a dog screened for health and temperament issues, and they might come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to an OED rescue organization, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
