  "breed_intro": "Poodles are intelligent, social and up for anything. They'll be your biggest cheerleader, encouraging you to focus on what truly matters in life, whatever that means to you. Whether you're at a farmer's market, watching TV or hanging out at a brewery, the active Poodle is the perfect 'plus one' for many of life's little adventures.",
  "appearance_description": "Poodles come in three sizes: standard (a relatively large dog); miniature (a small dog); and toy (a teeny tiny dog). Here are the height differences: Standard Poodles are considered a large-breed dog and stand taller than 15 inches at the shoulder. Miniature Poodles are less than 15 inches tall at the shoulder. Toy Poodles are a small dog breed, and are no more than 10 inches tall at the shoulder. Regardless of their size, they all share the same breed standard, which is a fancy way of saying they all look alike. Their heights and weights are proportionate. And they all can be groomed in the same fanciful ways. In fact, when you think of the Poodle's appearance, you probably think of the big poufy pompadour and snowball-shaped socks.",
  "temperament_description": "Poodles have been typecast as prissy, silly or neurotic, but in reality, this active dog breed defies Hollywood stereotypes with their outgoing, friendly and eager-to-please personality. However, their temperament can be influenced by the mood of those around them: Poodles who live in chaotic households or homes where people are barely home may resort to attention-seeking behavior, such as barking or chewing. That's because Poodles form deep, loving bonds with their pet parents and prefer to spend time with you over almost anything else.\n\nThat's not to say they can't be alone: Their innate intelligence enables them to excel in obedience and early socialization, so if you properly train them to be comfortable with being alone, they'll be fine. There are always exceptions to any rule, but generally Poodles are not a high-anxiety breed.",
  "care_description": "You think a Poodle's a delicate flower? Hardly! Bred as hunting dogs with superior running and swimming skills, Poodles are a hardy breed group who love to show off. They'll absorb new knowledge their whole life long  and are always up for a training sesh to try new tricks. They adore spending time outdoors; socializing with people and pets; and of course, going on adventures with their BFF'you.",
  "grooming_description": "Poodles' distinctive, curly coat is frequently groomed in one of three spectacular ways:\n\n \tEnglish Saddle: shaved all over, except for puffs on the head, bottom of the legs and the top of the tail\n \tContinental: the traditional 'French Poodle' cut\n \tSporting clip: face, feet, neck and base of tail are shaved, but a pouf is left on the head and tail while the rest of the body is cut to 1 inch, like a short blanket.\n\nYou don't have to groom a Poodle like they're headed to the show ring, though. Many pet parents opt to let their dogs go au naturel.\n\nLet's clear up some misconceptions about their trademark froufrou coat. That distinctive cut'the furry 'bracelets' on their ankles, followed by closely shaved legs known as the Continental clip'has a working dog background. Historically, people groomed Poodles that way to maximize their waterfowl-hunting abilities. The fur around their joints kept them warm in cold water, while the rest of their closely shaven body would reduce drag while chasing after ducks. Today, fancy Poodle styles are mostly for aesthetics. How you style your dog is completely up to you! Just be sure to follow these basic grooming tips:\n\n \tFor routine grooming, you'll need a slicker brush to brush your pup every day; be sure to get all the way to the skin to prevent mats. The more thoroughly you brush your Poodle, the less frequently you have to bathe them. You should bathe your Poodle every four to eight weeks unless they had a mud bath. You can find shampoos formulated specifically for Poodles, which can boost the color of light or white-colored poodles. Their fur will dry quickly (remember, they're a water-loving breed) or you can use a high-velocity dryer designed for dogs.\n \tCheck their eyes for tear stains. Tear stains are streaks that discolor your pup's fur. This eye discharge is your pup's way of getting rid of debris in the eye. Even though the tears are clear, there's a pigment in the tears that stains your dog's hair. Use a damp washcloth or eye care wipes to gently clean the fur around your pup's eyes. (Get more tips for getting rid of tear stains here.)\n \tYour Poodle's cute and floppy ears also need some TLC. Check their ears at least once a week, looking for buildup, hair growth or bad odors. You may need to pluck or trim the hair in their ears with rounded shears. Ask your vet at your puppy's first well visit what to watch for and how best to clean their ears.\n \tYour pup will need a haircut every four to eight weeks, right alongside bath time.\n \tIf you take your pup to the groomer, ask them to trim your dog's nails. If you hear their nails clicking on the hardwood floor, though, you may need to give your pup a pedicure in between spa dates. (A nail grinder is great for this.)\n \tBe sure to brush your pup's teeth daily. Have your vet show you how if you need help. Start brushing those pearly whites while your dog's a puppy since Poodles are prone to periodontal disease, and have your vet professionally clean their teeth once a year for optimal dental health.",
  "training_description": "Socialization is the most important part of a young Poodle's training. Poodles learn basic commands and tricks easily, but they may struggle with new environments and encounters if they weren't properly exposed to different people, places and things when they were little. Bring them as your plus-one on errands as soon as your vet gives you the go-ahead so they experience lots of positive interactions in a variety of environments.\n\nLearn how to properly socialize a puppy.\n\nSimultaneously, you can teach them basic commands, like sit, stay and come as well as tricks, like shake their paw. Poodles proudly take on the role of teacher's pet, relishing learning and training sessions with their pet parents. Devote 20 minutes or so every day to training, giving your pet a chance to show off what they know.\n\nAs your Poodle puppy grows and masters basic training, consider enrolling your dog in classes such as agility or Canine Good Citizen training. Classes can help keep your Poodle mentally stimulated and provide socialization.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Ensuring your pet's well-being is top priority, and a significant part of their health revolves around their diet. Poodles typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food, but it's important to tailor their meals based on their life stage, be they puppy, adult or senior.\n\nTo make the right choice, always look for dog food formulas that meet the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (look on the packaging for a nutritional adequacy statement). This ensures they get all the nutrients they need.\n\nLike any other breed, Poodles are at risk for obesity. A pound or two of extra weight (or even just a few ounces in toy and miniature Poodle breeds) can lead to health problems. The challenge is to not feed your Poodle too many treats during training sessions. Coming up with a smart treat strategy is crucial.\n\nIn addition to dog-specific treats in moderation, consider offering healthier alternatives such as frozen blueberries, peas, cut-up carrots, pieces of cucumber or celery.\n\nWork with your vet to create a balanced meal plan; they're in the best position to make recommendations specific to your individual pet.\n\nSometimes, food intolerances or sensitivities may lead to  health problems, such as itchy ears or dry skin. In some cases, your veterinarian may suggest your Poodle steer clear of certain ingredients, like wheat, or add more of something like healthy fats for a lustrous coat and healthy skin.\n\nBy proactively managing their diet and treat choices, you can give your Poodle the best chance at a long, healthy and happy life.",
  "exercise_description": "Don't let the 'non-sporting' label fool you: Poodles are high-energy athletes. They shine in competitive agility, obedience and tracking, and love getting in touch with their inner hunter by playing fetch and retrieving games with toys like disc toys and balls.\r\n\r\nThey're capable jocks, to be sure, but they're also suited to many activity levels. They need at least one hour a day of engaging exercise, whether that's a casual daily walk or a trip to the dog run. Some may even enjoy jogging with you (just check with the vet before you embark on a couch-to-5K with your canine).\r\n\r\nSince Poodles are water retrievers, they love to play fetch in water with balls designed to float. They're generally good swimmers and can have a lot of fun in the pool or on the lake. However, some Poodles may need a slow introduction to water. They also love running, digging and jumping, and don't mind getting their coats dirty in pursuit of a good time.\r\n\r\nWhatever exercise route you choose, rest assured your Poodle will love every minute spent with you. Their enthusiasm and athleticism allows them to embrace all kinds of activity.",
  "ideal_environment": "Despite popular opinion that Poodles are persnickety, the Poodle dog breed is actually remarkably adaptable.Whether as a loving family companion or a devoted partner to a solo pup parent, Poodles excel in both roles thanks to their affable nature.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to kids, Poodles are usually great playmates, but be sure to consider a dog's individual personality. Some Poodles used to being the center of attention might find sharing the spotlight with a high-energy toddler stressful. So if you need another reason to start socializing and training your pooch as a puppy, here it is. Remember to also teach children how to respectfully and safely interact with dogs, too.\r\n\r\nPoodles want to feel like valued members of the family, interacting with people throughout the day in and out of the home. If you need to leave your pup by their lonesome for a few hours, consider hiring a dog walker, enlisting the help of a neighbor or enrolling your pup in doggy daycare.",
  "health_description": "Poodles are a generally healthy dog breed. Like all dogs, they're prone to certain health conditions, but compared to most other breeds, they have fewer genetic health issues.\r\n\r\nPoodles have variable lifespans depending on their size. Though exceptions exist, toy, miniature and standard Poodles can live up to 18 years. However, there are some health issues to be aware of to help your Poodle have a happy, long life.\r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Poodles may be susceptible to hip dysplasia, a condition in which the ball and socket of the hip joint don't fit together correctly, which can cause mobility issues. Hip dysplasia has a genetic and environmental component. The treatment is physical therapy, medication and surgery in severe cases.\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: This often-genetic orthopedic condition results when the kneecap is able to slip in and out of place resulting in potential lameness, pain and arthritis. Treatment options include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication and, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone, which can lead to weight gain, lethargy and hair loss. Hypothyroidism is typically easily detected with a simple blood test and treated with an oral prescription medication.\r\n \tEye Issues: Some Poodles may be susceptible to eye issues, including:\r\n\r\n \tCataracts\r\n \tOptic nerve hypoplasia (a condition some dogs are born with)\r\n \tProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA)\r\n \tGlaucoma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of these can cause blindness, but surgery can treat cataracts and glaucoma. The good news is that Poodles can live a happy life even if they lose their sight and can learn to rely on other senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSebaceous Adenitis: This skin disease can inflame the sebaceous glands (glands on the skin responsible for lubricating the skin and hair follicles). This condition can lead to hair loss, scaly skin or irritated patches on the dog's skin.\r\n \tMitral Valve Disease: Poodles can be prone to a heart condition where the valves on the left side of the heart leak. This usually is picked up by your vet as a heart murmur. If your vet hears a heart murmur, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause.\r\n \tAddison's Disease: This endocrine condition often seen in Poodles occurs when the body does not make enough of its own natural steroid, cortisol. This can present as an acute emergency situation where the dog collapses or can be a more chronic presentation of weight loss, lethargy and vomiting/diarrhea. Your vet can perform blood tests to diagnose Addisons and start your pup on the necessary treatment plan. Preventative care is essential. Help your pup maintain a healthy weight; provide ample opportunities for exercise; and brush their teeth. Also, note any time your Poodle seems in pain or changes their behavior, such as losing interest in food or toys, or acting more lethargic or irritable than usual. If you see any of these changes, contact your vet.",
  "history_description": "Long before the Poodle's regal reputation took root, the breed's origins were far from the elegant, frou-frou and French associations they carry today. The Poodle may be the national dog of France, where they are known as the Caniche ('duck dog'), but the breed originated in Germany over 400 years ago. Bred for duck hunting, the Poodle was a specialized dog with a love of water. The term 'poodle' comes from the German word 'pudelin,' or splashing in the water.\n\nIn ancient times, the Poodle's ancestors were likely ship dogs who retrieved things that fell overboard (including people); guarded ships; and otherwise served as a trusty mate to deckhands. During the Renaissance, French nobility spotted these German duck hunters and, charmed by their good looks and endearing temperament, began bringing them into the courts as companions. Circuses, too, took note of Poodles' good temperament and easy-to-train traits, and the Poodle dog became a circus-performing favorite.\n\nThe Poodle eventually found their way to the United States, though exactly when is a bit murky. In 1887, the American Kennel Club (AKC) first recognized the breed. Today, their distinctive style and winning personality make them stand out; the Poodle has continually been one of the most popular dog breeds in America. They rank in the top ten on the list of most popular dog breeds.\nHow do you get a Poodle as a pet?\nA purebred puppy can cost $700 to $2,000, a price you should only pay if your breeder screens their breeding stock for health issues. You can find reputable breeders at the AKC website.\n\nIf you'd prefer to adopt a Poodle, start by contacting the Poodle Club of America Rescue Foundation; visiting Chewy's pet search; or looking for the breed at your local shelter.\n5 Poodle Facts\n\n \tThese dogs were initially bred in Germany to be duck hunters. Then France downsized them to be toys.\n \tThey're an incredibly versatile breed. They hunt; do agility, nose work, rally/obedience, therapy and service dog work; barn hunt; and do Fastcat (a 100-yard dash chasing a lure), conformation and tracking.\n \tIn the mid-1970s, one Iditarod participant created a sled team partially made of Poodles, and the dogs put up a good race against more traditional sled dog breeds like Huskies.\n \tPoodles can be clowns: joyous, friendly, eager to please, and they love their families. They want to be with their people.\n \tPoodle coats shed very little, making the breed a popular choice if you have allergies or want a dog that doesn't require much vacuuming.",
