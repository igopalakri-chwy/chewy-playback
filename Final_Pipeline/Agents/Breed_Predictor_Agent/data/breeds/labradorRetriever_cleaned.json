  "breed_intro": "The Labrador Retriever has been one of the nation's favorite dogs for decades, and it's not hard to see why. Labs are known for being incredibly outgoing, intelligent and family-friendly. An energetic sporting breed, this popular pup lives for time spent in the Great Outdoors, especially when water is involved. If your weekend plans often include activities like hiking and swimming, you'll find a willing and eager partner in the Lab. Their peppy personality and happy-go-lucky nature make for life's sweetest adventures.",
  "appearance_description": "The Labrador Retriever dog breed is generally muscular and stout with naturally floppy ears, wide noses and expressive eyes. They tend to have short, dense coats that repel water'no raincoats needed here! Labs are slightly squarish in shape, with an athletic build, sturdy legs and webbed feet, which are perfect for swimming'one of their favorite things to do. Labradors come in three main colors: black, chocolate and yellow. You can find silver and white Labrador puppies, but they are not considered part of the breed standard.",
  "temperament_description": "Cheerful and animated, this large dog breed has stamina and energy to spare, able to keep up with your family and all your activities. You'll want to funnel that energy into positive outlets, like outdoor activities and training. And thanks to their high intelligence, learning commands and tricks come relativity easy for them. Labrador dogs love having a job to do and excel at things like agility courses and, just like their name implies, retrieving items. In fact, their superior intelligence is why they often make great assistance dogs, working as therapy or service animals.\r\n\r\nA people-pleaser, Labrador Retrievers have a pleasant personality and love interacting with humans. Get ready to be showered with lots of affection! They also easily make friends with dogs and other animals, including cats, although not all cats are as excited to meet them as they are'a Lab's large size and high energy level can be a bit intimidating. Slow and controlled introductions to other family pets will help make the transition go smoothly. Considering the staying power of the Labrador dog breed's popularity, it's a safe bet your Lab will fit right in with the all the loved ones you choose to introduce into their life.\r\n\r\nWhile they're generally good-natured, like any dog breed, Labs may develop aggressive tendencies if they don't receive proper training or have experienced abuse. Addressing any biting issues early on, providing proper socialization when they are puppies (aka safely exposing them to lots of new people, places and things) and working with a professional dog trainer can help avoid behavioral issues when they get older.",
  "care_description": "As you might expect with such a popular dog breed, Labs are relatively easy to care for and make great dogs for first-time pet parents. With the right tools and a little TLC, you'll be ready to help your pup live a healthy, full life. The toughest part about taking care of a Lab will likely be your ability to keep up with them!",
  "grooming_description": "A Labrador Retriever's grooming needs are fairly low compared to some other dog breeds.\r\n\r\n \tBrushing: Because a Labrador has short hair, they don't really need a haircut. However, they do shed a lot twice a year (the spring and fall), and you'll need to brush them every day during these high-shed times. For more routine maintenance, brush them at least once a week. Consider using a tool like the Furminator to help brush out the undercoat and remove the excess fur.\r\n \tBathing: Labs who spend most of their time indoors should be bathed every four to six weeks, using a dog shampoo. You can do this at home or have it done by a professional groomer. For those who get a lot of outdoor time, you should bathe them weekly. Daily rinsing is probably best if your pup's daily escapades get them a little too dirty.\r\n \tEars: Check your Lab's ears to be sure they're debris-free. If you notice any swelling or redness, check with your vet; your pup may have an ear infection. Watch our guide for cleaning dog ears if your vet recommends you clean their ears at home\r\n \tTeeth: You should count on brushing your Labrador's teeth daily, using a dog toothpaste. If you're not sure how to brush your pup's teeth, your vet can teach you. (Watch our how-to video.) It's also a good idea to get their teeth professionally cleaned once a year by your vet.\r\n \tNails: Clip your Lab's nails every 3-4 weeks or as soon as you hear them clicking on hard surfaces. You can do it at home, but a groomer or your vet can do it, too. It's a good idea to start trimming your Lab's nails when they're a puppy so they get used to it and don't mind a trim when they're older.",
  "training_description": "Labs are eager to please and intelligent, making them highly trainable. You can begin obedience school with your Labrador puppy between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months. They can learn the basics such as potty training, obedience commands'sit, stay and come when called'and leash skills. Labs can be leash-pullers and jumpers. To help train dogs more effectively, choose a headcollar to help prevent pulling and provide more control. A certified professional dog trainer can provide more guidance on correcting the issue.\r\n\r\nIn general, Labs are extremely friendly and do well in most social interactions as long as they are properly socialized. Introduce them slowly and safely to new people, other dogs and animals, nature and public settings as soon as they are vaccinated and your vet gives the \"all clear.\"\r\n\r\nLabradors really shine in advanced training sessions. As a sporting dog, they excel in agility competitions, hunting and other field activities. They also make excellent guide dogs for the blind and visually impaired, bomb- and drug-sniffing dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Labs typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). While there is no breed-specific standard feeding chart, your veterinarian can help you determine an appropriate feeding schedule and the best amount of food to meet your dog's unique nutrition needs.\r\n\r\nBecause Labs are so active and always on the go, they may benefit from a high-protein dog food. As always, consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to your Lab's diet, as they are in the best position to help you pick a great dog food for your pup based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nWhile treats are often used in training, be sure to limit the amount you dish out on the daily. An overabundance of dog treats, even if your pup is super active, is an easy way for them to pack on the pounds.",
  "exercise_description": "It's safe to say Labs are high-energy dogs. It's essential for them to have positive outlets to expend all that energy, like running and swimming. Take them for runs around the neighborhood or at the dog park, in addition to regular walks and hikes. At least one hour a day of exercise is ideal. Fair warning: A Labrador's speed can be challenging to keep up with. A great way to burn off their energy is to enroll them in agility course training or let them swim in a pool, lake or ocean if you have those options nearby.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of swimming, Labs absolutely love the water'they were, after all, bred to be waterdogs, retrieving fish and fowl. Lab parents should prioritize water-based outings as often as possible to ensure that their pup gets the precious water time they love. Since Labs are natural swimmers, dock diving makes for a fun exercise that will keep them entertained for hours on end.",
  "ideal_environment": "Labs want attention'and lots of it. Their ideal environment is, unsurprisingly, one where they can be smothered with cuddles, hugs and kisses. Because of their amicable attitude, these friendly dogs generally do well with kids and other pets, and they aren't likely to bark at or be aggressive toward strangers'of course, provided they've received proper socialization and training. Having friends over for dinner? Your good-natured Lab is likely to steal the show with their cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nLabs are extremely versatile and tend to flourish in many different environments, from urban to rural. In the city, you'll need to ensure they receive enough physical exercise and mental stimulation. In suburban and rural places, they'll have more room to run but you should still ensure they are getting their daily exercise. (A game of fetch is always a fun option for retrievers!) Without a doubt, Labs need an equally active pet parent who won't shy away from going on everyday adventures.",
  "health_description": "Labrador Retrievers are usually very healthy dogs with a typical life span of 11-13 years. However, there are a few common health issues you'll want to be aware of'from joint problems to bloat'so you can keep your pup healthy for longer.\r\n\r\n \tElbow Dysplasia: When an elbow joint grows abnormally, your pup might experience stiffness, lameness or pain in their forelimbs. Treatment will depend on the primary cause of elbow dysplasia, but in most cases, surgery is recommended.\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia, where the femur doesn't fit correctly in the hip socket, can lead to early signs of arthritis, including limping or general pain. Treatment ranges from weight management, joint supplements, pain medication or, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA describes a number of diseases that can cause degeneration of the lining in the retina, which is in the back of the eye. In some cases, this condition can lead to blindness. There is no cure, but genetic screening testing is available.\r\n \tBloat: Bloat, otherwise known as gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is an emergency medical condition where the dog's stomach becomes filled with gas and twists upon itself. This is very serious and can be deadly if not treated immediately. To help lower the risk of bloat in your Lab, avoid exercise for at least one hour before or after eating, try serving smaller and more frequent meals throughout the day or use a food bowl designed to slow down your dog's eating.\r\n \tExercise Induced Collapse (EIC): EIC is a genetic condition seen in Labs that results in weakness and collapse after exercise. There is no cure, but the symptoms can often be managed with exercise restriction.",
  "history_description": "Originally called the St. Johns Dog or the lesser Newfoundland, Labrador Retrievers originated in Newfoundland (not Labrador), Canada, and are longtime descendants of the now-extinct St. John's Water Dog, a hunting dog. With their strong hunting heritage, Labradors first became popularized in the early 1800s as a waterdog who could help fishermen retrieve fish and ducks and bring them back to their boats. Their soft mouths and gentle jaws made them perfect for delicately handling birds and fish. Eventually, they were brought across the Atlantic Ocean to England after English nobles visited Canada. There, the English continued to refine the breed in the second half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the Labrador breed has only continued to grow since then. Today, modern Labs are among the most popular dogs in America, according to the American Kennel Club, which formally recognized the breed in 1917. Labs are mostly sought after for their unmatched diving aptitude and ability to work in the water, largely thanks to their water-repellent coats, webbed feet and otter-like tail.\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find a Labrador Retriever puppy? You can find a list of reputable Labrador Retriever breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Labrador Retriever price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Labrador Retriever rescue organizations to adopt a Lab, check Chewy's database of adoptable Labrador Retrievers, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.",

    {
      "question": "Are Labrador Retrievers hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "No, Labs are not hypoallergenic. In fact, Labs shed frequently. Overall, some dog breeds may have less reactive dander, which may make them be seen as hypoallergenic. But it mainly depends on how your body responds and how sensitive your allergies are to any particular animal."

    {
      "question": "Can Labrador Retrievers swim?",
      "answer": "Yes, Labrador Retrievers can swim; they have webbed feet, which help propel them through the water. They readily jump into the water to retrieve fish or ducks when directed. Swimming and dock diving are excellent forms of exercise for Labs and will definitely wear them out if you're looking forward to some quiet time at home."
