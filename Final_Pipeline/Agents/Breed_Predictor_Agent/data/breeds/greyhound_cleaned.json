  "breed_intro": "Greyhounds are the track stars of the dog world. But not that cross-country nonsense. These dogs are all about sprinting events. Don't worry, you don't have to run along with them—as if you could keep up! They're just happy to have you as their cheer squad, so feel free to take your seat and watch them in action from the comfort of your fenced-in backyard. And yes, a fence is a must because once these dogs get going, there's not much stopping them. (They were bred to hunt game by sight without help from humans, so they're quite independent.) You might be wondering if they ever sit still long enough for you to shower them with love. They do, and they're actually quite laid back when not zooming all over the place. Just don't make the mistake of picking up your keys, or else they'll be headed to the door before you know it.",
  "appearance_description": "Greyhounds are large and sleek with a rocket-like build: small head, wider at the middle, and smaller toward the backend, which was the perfect aerodynamic design for their hunting days. Their short coats only add to their sleek appeal, and their long tail acts like a rudder to guide them when they're in hot pursuit.",
  "temperament_description": "Greyhounds (aka English Greyhounds) are friendly, gentle dogs who make great family pets.\n\nThis dog breed has spurts of energy they need to get rid of (off-leash) throughout the day, but once their energy is depleted, they're quiet and calm. Unless there's a rabbit or a squirrel nearby, they are a pretty chill breed who will lie at your feet when you're relaxing at home.\n\nBecause Greyhounds are sighthounds (dogs who hunt by sight instead of by scent), they were bred to pursue game independently of their human hunting buddies. That means they have a rather independent streak, so proper training and early socialization will help them be well-mannered members of the family.",
  "care_description": "The Greyhound breed is a laid-back dog with a maintenance routine to match. They don't shed much nor do they need a lot of brushing. (They don't even need a lot of baths!) And while they have really high energy levels, once that need for physical exertion is satisfied, they're content to be a couch potato with you for the rest of the day.",
  "grooming_description": "A Greyhound puppy or adult dog doesn't have many grooming needs due to that lovely short coat. You'll only encounter occasional shedding throughout the year, so brushing them for a few minutes a day with a curry brush (also called a hound mitt) or a grooming glove is all you need to do.\n\nEnglish Greyhounds don't need frequent baths (they don't have that traditionally dirty doggy smell!) and can be bathed about once every two months or so. They may need more frequent baths in warmer months after off-leash play. You can touch them up in between baths with a damp washcloth or pet wipes.\n\nBrush their teeth at least a few times a week to help reduce tartar that could lead to gum disease and health problems down the line. If you need help, ask your vet to show you how to brush their teeth. Once a year, your vet should professionally clean their teeth to keep them healthy.\n\nYou'll probably need to trim your Greyhound's nails every two to three weeks, depending on the types of surfaces they walk and run on. (Harder surfaces, like concrete, will wear them down more quickly.) You'll know it's time to give them a trim when you hear them clacking on your hardwood floors.",
  "training_description": "Greyhounds are friendly pups, but they have a rather independent nature. Remember: They were bred to hunt game independently of humans (using their sight and not taking direction from people), so they've got a mind of their own. Consistency and positive reinforcement are essential tools in the training process. (Positive reinforcement training uses praise, high-value treats and toys to reward the dog for a job well done.)\n\nLearning how to sit and stay are crucial for this dog who was bred to chase game. Make sure you have a proper-fitting collar and leash if you're training your Greyhound outdoors in a place where they can possibly run away. (You'll know the collar fits well when you can slide two fingers snugly between the collar and their neck.)\n\nIn addition to being independent minded, Greyhound dogs are intelligent and may get bored with long, repetitive sessions. So, keep the sessions short, about five to ten minutes at a time, and spread them throughout the day.\n\nSocialization is also important, especially when they are young. Be sure to create safe and positive opportunities for your puppy to interact with people and other dogs outside your home. A group puppy obedience class is not just a great place to learn basic commands but also to make new friends. (And for you to play with other adorable puppies!)",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Greyhound breed tends to have a higher metabolic rate (and less body fat) than other breeds, so they typically require a diet that is somewhat higher in calories and protein than other dogs, especially if they are very active. Their diet should consist of a high-quality dog food that is formulated to meet the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials and should be appropriate for the dog's stage of life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep your pup at a healthy weight—even a few extra pounds can create health issues for your dog. As you're planning your pup's mealtime routine, don't forget all the treats you give throughout the day. Those calories count, too! Your vet can help you determine the best food plan for your dog to meet their nutritional needs based on their lifestyle, age and any health concerns.",
  "exercise_description": "Greyhounds have a need for speed that should be satisfied often. Carve out time every day for walks and give them opportunities to sprint off-leash in a safe, fenced environment. At least 30 minutes or more twice a day should keep them healthy, engaged and address their exercise needs. If you don't live in a home with a large fenced-in yard, make sure you have a roomy fenced-in dog park your pup can frequent a few times a week to let off some steam. The key word is fenced-in. These hunting dogs have a high prey drive and can be easily distracted by a passing squirrel or stray cat if allowed off-leash in an unsafe and unfenced area. The good news is that you don't have to run with them—unless you let them chase you or race you for fun. (Spoiler alert: They'll always win.)\r\n\r\nGreyhounds have been called the \"cheetahs of the dog world\" because of their exceptional speed, which makes them well-suited for active dog sports such as lure coursing. Lure coursing is an activity where dogs chase a motorized, white plastic lure around an enclosed yard and is a great way for your Greyhound to satisfy their natural urge to chase \"prey\" in a controlled, safe environment.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to exercise their brains, too. Break out the dog toys and play with them or give them a puzzle toy. And after your pup's full day of play and learning, they're content to relax on their dog beds and chill.",
  "ideal_environment": "While Greyhounds can thrive in a variety of environments, they do best in homes with large, fenced yards where they can run to their heart's content (followed up by a nap). However, if you live in an apartment and have your heart set on one of these athletic dogs as a pet, be sure you have access to a fenced area you can visit every day to help manage their energy bursts; check the regulations for your local dog park to make sure they are large-breed friendly. (Or, consider the Greyhound's smaller cousin, the Italian Greyhound, who is well-suited for apartment life.)\r\n\r\nBecause of their amicable attitude, Greyhounds generally do well with well-behaved kids and other dogs, but it's always a good idea to start socializing them early.",
  "health_description": "Greyhounds have a life expectancy of 10 to 13 years and are generally healthy dogs. However, there are a few health issues you need to be aware of, so you can help your pup live the longest and happiest life possible.\n\n \t• Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Because of their deep chests, Greyhounds may experience GDV (aka bloat), which causes the dog’s stomach to fill with gas and become twisted. It can occur suddenly and is a life-threatening emergency. To help reduce the chance of your dog experiencing GDV, use a slow feeding bowl at mealtime, keep the bowl on the ground (don’t elevate it) and avoid exercising at least an hour before or after mealtime. If you think your pup is suffering from GDV, get to your vet immediately.\nGreyhound Neuropathy: This inherited neurological condition, also referred to as Greyhound polyneuropathy, appears to only affect this breed and causes abnormalities to the nervous system. Symptoms usually occur at around 8 to 12 weeks old and show up as muscle weakness, lack of desire to exercise and even showing up as a “gallop” with turned-out knees. There is no treatment for the condition at this time, but genetic screening testing is available so be sure to ask your breeder.\nBlood Clotting: Some Greyhounds have problems with blood clotting that may appear delayed (up to 5 days) after an injury, surgery or dental work. Here, the blood starts to clot, then the clots dissolve. There is no way to predict if a dog has it until the intense bruising shows up. There are medications that can help with clotting, so make sure to ask your vet.\nCancer: Bone cancer (osteosarcoma) is a common cancer for Greyhounds. Signs to look for include weakness, lameness, limping, swellings on the body or exhibiting signs of hunger, but your dog is losing weight. Treatment options include pain medication, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.\nBack and Joint Problems: If your Greyhound is a retired racer, they might experience pain and stiffness in the joints (like arthritis) from their previous career. Maintaining a high-quality diet and regular exercise can help prevent some of these joint issues. Ask your vet if they recommend supplements to help prevent or alleviate joint health problems with your Greyhound.\nDrug Sensitivity: Greyhounds have a sensitivity to some drugs due to a deficiency in a group of liver enzymes (cytochrome P450) responsible for drug metabolism. This means they could have prolonged recovery after anesthesia or sedation, but it will not impact their normal day to day life. Be sure to discuss any questions or concerns with your veterinarian.",
  "history_description": "Their origins are rooted deep in ancient history—ancient Egypt, to be exact. Pharaohs reportedly used them to hunt wild game, and pictures of Greyhounds can be found in pyramids.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, Greyhounds became a recognized sign of nobility in Europe during the Middle Ages (mere commoners couldn't have them), and later, their high-class status was cemented in Renaissance paintings. In the 16th century, lure coursing became a popular sport (using real rabbits), but the winner didn't always catch the rabbit. The competing dogs were judged mainly on their speed, concentration and agility. The rules of lure coursing are basically the same to this day (minus the live rabbits, of course).\r\n\r\nTheir popularity continued to swell through the 19th century in England and Wales, as Greyhounds were used to get rid of hares, foxes and badgers from fields. Coursing races were still incredibly popular with the wealthy, too, and it didn't hurt that Prince Albert (married to Queen Victoria) had one as a pet in the 1800s. That Greyhound was captured in a painting called \"Eos, A Favourite Greyhound, Property of HRH Prince Albert.\"\r\n\r\nGreyhounds were brought to the U.S. from Ireland and England during the mid-1800s to hunt down jackrabbits that were destroying Midwestern farms. (Greyhounds can see for up to half a mile, and these dogs are fast—their top speed is over 40 MPH, giving them a distinct advantage over their prey.)\r\n\r\nThe English love for racing Greyhounds followed the dog to the United States. In the early 1900s, an American developed a lure that could run on the circular track used by horses. Greyhound track racing became a popular spectator sport in America, hitting its peak in the early 1990s. But they aren't just great racers; Greyhounds were among the participants in the very first Westminster Kennel Club dog show in 1877.\r\n\r\nGreyhounds joined the American Kennel Club in 1885 as one of the first recognized breeds, and the Greyhound Club of America was formed in 1907.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in raising a Greyhound? Today, Greyhound puppies can cost up to $1,000 for a purebred. But for that price, you often get a dog who's been screened for health issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can find reputable breeders at the AKC's website. You can also adopt them through Greyhound rescues or keep an eye out for them at your local shelter. Search Chewy's database for adoptable Greyhounds in your area to get started.",
