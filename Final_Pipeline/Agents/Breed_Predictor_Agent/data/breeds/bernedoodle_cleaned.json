  "breed_intro": "As a cross between a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Toy Poodle, Miniature Poodle, or Standard Poodle, Bernedoodles are known for their friendly, intelligent, and playful nature. Like their Poodle parent, Bernedoodles come in three different sizes, from under 20 to more than 100 pounds.\n\nBernedoodles love being the center of attention, so prepare to meet new people when you’re out and about with your pup. With smarts from their Poodle side, Bernedoodle dogs love to learn tricks and thrive when given mental challenges (stock up on puzzles and games!).\n\nMany are low-shedding dogs, but this isn’t a guarantee. While Poodles have a reputation for being “hypoallergenic” pups (though there’s really no such thing), Bernese Mountain Dogs are heavy shedders. There’s no way to tell which coat a Bernedoodle puppy will inherit.",
  "appearance_description": "Bernedoodles often boast a tricolor coat of black, white, and brown. But solid or bicolor variations also exist, thanks to their Poodle genes. Their wavy or curly fur gives them a teddy bear–like appearance, and their expressive eyes and floppy ears add to their charm.",
  "temperament_description": "A Bernedoodle personality is the ultimate mix of affection, playfulness, and smarts—perfectly blending the loyalty of the Bernese Mountain Dog with the cleverness of the Poodle. These lovable dogs thrive on attention and will happily become your new best friend, as they are eager to please and always ready for fun.\n\nCalling a Bernedoodle “friendly” doesn’t do this dog justice. Bernedoodles are social butterflies. They adore kids, making them excellent family pets, and they're equally affectionate toward dogs, cats, and other animals alike.\n\nTheir easygoing nature means they fit in well with almost any pack, whether it's a busy household or a quieter home. Just remember: Bernedoodles, like all dogs, do best with lots of socialization so they are happy, confident, and well-adjusted in any situation.\n\nOutgoing Bernedoodles thrive on interaction, whether it's a game of fetch, a cuddle session, or a walk around the neighborhood. But don’t leave them alone for too long—they might feel a little sad if left behind for extended periods. (Crate training and interactive toys can help keep separation anxiety at bay!)\n\nWhile not traditionally \"working\" dogs, Bernedoodles are highly trainable and can excel in all kinds of roles. They make fantastic therapy and emotional support dogs, offering comfort and companionship to those who need it. And thanks to their quick minds and boundless energy, they love canine sports and activities like agility and obedience.",
  "care_description": "A Bernedoodle might look more like a stuffed animal than a dog, but these athletic pups still need regular exercise, mental stimulation, and consistent grooming.",
  "grooming_description": "Bernedoodles are known for low-shedding wavy or curly coats, but they require regular grooming to keep them looking (and feeling!) their best. Here are some grooming best practices:\n\n\t• Brush your dog’s coat two to three times a week to prevent tangles and mats. A slicker brush, a pin brush, and a metal comb are all good tools to have in your grooming kit.\nBathe your dog every four to six weeks with a dog-friendly shampoo. You may need to bathe your Bernedoodle more or less frequently depending on your pup’s activity level and lifestyle.\nClean your dog’s ears after every bath or swimming session. Use a vet-recommended ear cleaner, and follow your veterinarian’s guidance to prevent ear infections.\nTo prevent discomfort, trim your dog’s nails as needed. (If you hear your Bernedoodle clacking across the floor when they walk, it’s time for a manicure.)\nBrush your dog’s teeth every day to prevent dental disease. Dental treats, water additives, and a dental-focused diet can help maintain good hygiene, too.",
  "training_description": "As smart and eager-to-please dogs, Bernedoodle puppies make star pupils. Positive reinforcement training is the key to teaching good manners and tricks, so use lots of praise and treats.\n\nThe pups are typically easy to train, thanks to their natural aptitude for learning. But some Bernedoodles might be a little willful, so patience and consistency is required during training sessions.\n\nWhile Bernedoodles tend to be outgoing and friendly, it’s important that they receive lots of socialization during puppyhood. This will help them become confident, calm, and well-behaved in all types of situations, whether that’s meeting new animals or exploring new environments.",
  "diet_nutrition": "A Bernedoodle needs a well-balanced, AAFCO-compliant diet to stay healthy and energetic. As active dogs, they might benefit from a food labeled “sport” or “performance” to fuel their daily play.\n\nFeed your Bernedoodle twice a day—once in the morning and again in the evening. Bernedoodle puppies may need more frequent meals to help them grow. Toy and Mini Bernedoodle puppies in particular benefit from three to four meals per day to prevent low blood sugar.\n\nIt’s smart to restrict exercise for an hour before and after a Standard Bernedoodle eats. This helps prevent full-grown Bernedoodles from developing bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), which can be life-threatening. Feeding your dog from a slow-feeder bowl and avoiding elevated bowls can help, too. \n\nTreats can (and should!) be used during training, but give them in moderation to maintain a healthy weight. Chat with your vet for specific dietary needs based on your dog’s size and health.",
  "exercise_description": "Bernedoodles need to keep a busy schedule. Routine walks and playtime need to happen every day, with other mentally stimulating activities like puzzle toys and training sessions on the docket, too. Standard Bernedoodles enjoy running, hiking, or swimming when the weather’s nice, while the smaller varieties might be happy with high-energy backyard playtime.\n\nIn total, Bernedoodles need about an hour of physical activity every day. While they’re happy to lounge around after a good workout, a lack of exercise can lead to boredom and, ultimately, undesirable behaviors like chewing up your home or nuisance barking.",
  "ideal_environment": "Bernedoodles are adaptable dogs. This means they can thrive in many different living environments, from apartments to suburbia to farmlands (although the bigger Standard Bernedoodles may need more space than what a small apartment allows).\n\nAll a Bernedoodle needs is a home with a pet parent who’s willing to engage, exercise, and groom them. Because they make a good companion for other pets and kiddos of all ages, Bernedoodles are a great choice for families looking for a four-legged friend. Their friendly, social nature means they’ll happily join family adventures, whether indoors or out.",
  "health_description": "The average Bernedoodle lifespan is 12–18 years, though this largely depends on your Bernedoodle’s size. Because small dogs live longer than large dogs, toy Bernedoodles live closer to the 18-year mark, while Standard Bernedoodles might reach 12 years old.\n\nToy, Miniature, and Standard Bernedoodles may face different health challenges, too, so it’s essential to talk to your breeder and vet to know what to expect.\n\nWhen working with a Bernedoodle breeder, ask for a complete health history of your puppy and their parents, if possible. Reputable breeders should be able to provide you with vaccinations, health screenings, and family medical records.\n\nSome common health concerns for Bernedoodles are:\n\n\t• Hip and elbow dysplasia: Bernedoodles can inherit hip and elbow dysplasia, conditions where the joints develop abnormally, cause pain, and potentially lead to arthritis. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on the joints, and treatment may require medications, supplements, or surgery.\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA): This genetic eye condition causes gradual vision loss, often beginning with night blindness. Symptoms include clumsiness, dilated pupils, cataracts, and difficulty seeing in low light. While there’s no cure, Bernedoodles with PRA can still live fulfilling lives with proper care.\nAllergies: Although Bernedoodles are often considered hypoallergenic, they can experience allergies to food or environmental factors. Symptoms include itching, rashes, recurring ear infections, and hair loss. A veterinarian can help diagnose and treat allergies effectively.\nGastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Bernese Mountain Dogs and Standard Poodles both have deep chests, making them susceptible to life-threatening GDV. This puts Standard Bernedoodles at risk as well. Symptoms include restlessness, retching, a distended abdomen, and excessive drooling. GDV is a medical emergency—take your dog to an emergency vet immediately if you notice symptoms.",
  "history_description": "Bernedoodles are a relatively new hybrid breed created in 2003 by breeder Sherry Rupke of Swissridge Kennels. This designer dog combines the loyal, gentle nature of the Bernese Mountain Dog with the intelligence and hypoallergenic coat of the Poodle. The goal was to create a companion with the best traits of both breeds.\n\nUnlike the parent breeds, Bernedoodles were not developed for work. Instead, they were bred to be affectionate, family-friendly pets. Their adaptability, charm, and lower-shedding coats quickly made them popular among dog-lovers, particularly those with allergies.\n\nThe Bernedoodle is not officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). However, it is recognized by organizations like the Designer Breed Registry (DBR).\n\nToday, Bernedoodles are widely sought, and their popularity continues to grow due to their versatility and loving nature. They can be found through reputable breeders who specialize in this hybrid, and it’s essential to choose breeders who prioritize health screenings and ethical breeding practices.\n\nThe cost of a Bernedoodle puppy can range from $2,500–$5,000 or more, depending on size, coat type, color, and breeder reputation. Miniature and Toy varieties, as well as those with rare coat patterns, often have higher price tags. Bernedoodles are also occasionally available for adoption through rescue organizations specializing in Poodle mixes or Bernese Mountain Dog hybrids.\n\nFor those looking to add a loyal, intelligent, and playful companion to their family, the Bernedoodle offers a unique blend of qualities from its parent breeds.",
