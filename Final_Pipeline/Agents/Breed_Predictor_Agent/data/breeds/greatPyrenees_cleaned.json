  "breed_intro": "Have you ever done a double-take and wondered if a polar bear just moved into your neighborhood? It was probably just a Great Pyrenees.   \n\nA Pyr, as they’re sometimes called, is the kind of pup who looks like they were made for après-ski: Just picture them lying by a roaring fireplace with snow falling outside while you sip a hot cider and cuddle up by their furry side. But no matter the weather, these happy, gentle mountain dogs are devoted best friends all year round, and they make great family pets, too.",
  "appearance_description": "With their bright white coat and large frame, a Great Pyrenees has a striking appearance. They have a rounded head, intelligent brown eyes, a quiet gaze, a lot of fur, and a feathery tail.",
  "temperament_description": "Patient and affectionate, Great Pyrenees are generally friendly and well-suited to family life. They’ll get along well with kids if children are taught to respect your dog’s space, and Pyrs are likely to do well with cats, dogs, and other animals, too (their ancestors spent all that time hanging out with sheep, after all).  \n\nEven though Great Pyrenees are known for their gentleness, their origins as a guardian dog back in the day mean that they can have a mind of their own, so early training and socialization is essential.  \n\nTheir guardian dog legacy also left them with a high level of patience; this pup’s ancestors were accustomed to the slow pace of watching sheep for hours, and years later, that nugget of patience still lies within their soul. But that doesn’t mean they won’t bark; in fact, this wise soul will try to tell you what’s happening around the house and the neighborhood.  \n\nDespite any noisemaking, the serene Great Pyrenees enjoys a quiet home life (perfect for pet parents who appreciate evenings in front of the TV or with a good novel). Of course, exercise is a nonnegotiable—so like your pup, you’ll need to enjoy some activity, too.",
  "care_description": "Grooming a Great Pyrenees dog is less intense than you might think. But you do need to spend extra time on training and socialization, make sure they get daily exercise, and give them enough room to roam.",
  "grooming_description": "All that fur might look like it takes hours to tame, but it’s usually not the case. That said, you still need to spend time making sure your pup looks (and feels!) their best.\r\n\n\t• Bathing: A monthly bath is plenty for this breed, unless they get extra dirty. If you see matted fur, ask your vet about detangling conditioners. \nBrushing: A Pyrenees’ thick coat is surprisingly resistant to dirt and tangles. Still, you should brush your dog several times a week using a slicker brush or rake brush to keep them clean and mat-free.  \r\n\n\t• Pro Tip: Any pet parents with a black wardrobe may want to rethink their outfit choices. Great Pyrenees shed a ton, leaving a literal white trail all over the floor, sofa, and (possibly) you. Add an extra brushing session (or three!) to combat this blizzard of fluff. \r\n\nDental care: Brush your pup’s teeth daily, and get a yearly professional cleaning. \nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails every two weeks or anytime they start to touch the floor when your Pyr is standing (too-long nails may be painful). You’ll hear when it’s time for a trim—they’ll make clacking noises on hard surfaces.",
  "training_description": "You might feel a bit ignored when trying to train your Great Pyrenees, but don’t take it personally. They were bred to be independent thinkers, and it’s a powerful trait that lasts to this day. Once upon a time, these guardian dogs were used to working alone—not having to sit and come each time you offer a peanut butter treat. \n\nFor best results, keep your training sessions short and reward good behavior with treats, praise, and playtime.  \n\nDon’t overdo it with repetition, or you might get a look from your pup that lies somewhere between boredom and sympathy. Again, don’t take it personally; these calm, clever pups are super smart and prefer to be actively engaged with new things.  \n\nTrain in various settings and be realistic with your goals. Great Pyrenees are very intelligent, but they’re not as athletic as Border Collies or other breeds who live for competitive sports. Slow and steady wins the training race with the Great Pyrenees.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Pyrs do well on high-quality commercial dog food that’s high-protein and specially made for large breeds. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).  \n\nMake sure your dog doesn’t gobble up kibble. Great Pyrenees are susceptible to bloat, and eating a lot of food quickly can lead to this life-threatening condition. To help prevent bloat: \r\n\n\t• Feed your Great Pyrenees two or three meals per day instead of one big dinner. \nGive your dog food in a slow feeder bowl, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy to prevent them from eating too quickly.  \nDon’t exercise your Pyr for an hour before or after they eat.  \nAvoid using elevated food bowls—these might increase the risk of bloat.  \nAsk your veterinarian about a preventative gastropexy procedure. \r\n\nTreats are great rewards for good behavior, but don’t go wild. Too many yummy snacks add calories and could lead to obesity, which can cause health problems like heart disease.  \n\nChat with your vet if you have questions about your pup’s diet (or if they need to shed a few pounds). Treats should never be more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.",
  "exercise_description": "If you want a running buddy, a Great Pyrenees is not your perfect match. They don’t need a ton of strenuous exercise to be happy and healthy, and fast-paced activities don’t suit them.  \n\nJust like their ancestors, the Great Pyrenees is happiest on patrol—they prefer to conserve some energy in case they must protect a lost lamb! It’s a noble trait (shh, don’t tell them there won’t be sheep to save), but it’s up to you to ensure they get enough exercise to maintain muscle strength and physical conditioning.  \n\nMake sure your Great Pyrenees has 20–30 minutes of exercise a couple of times a day. They’ll love gentle strolls, afternoon hikes, or hanging out in the yard together.",
  "ideal_environment": "Chances are, a Great Pyrenees is going to get along great with your whole family, including the kids. You should still supervise them—if only because the Pyrenees is so big—and make sure that both kiddos and dog know how to interact with one another.   \n\nThe Great Pyrenees is usually happy to share a home with other dogs and cats, too. \n\nLots of (fenced!) outdoor space to roam and pace is ideal for the Great Pyrenees. They’d love acres of land, if you have it, which might rule out a small apartment or home in the city. However, you can meet your Great Pyrenees’ exercise needs anywhere if you’re consistent with your outings. \n\nThese pups are intelligent and independent—generally great characteristics in anyone, though they can be challenging for a first-time dog parent. New pet parents should recognize that this breed needs a confident and patient person to lead them through training.  \n\nClimate plays a huge part in an ideal environment for these dogs. Great Pyrenees were initially bred on snowy mountain tops, which means they’re accustomed to lower temperatures and don’t do well in hot weather.  \n\nIf you live somewhere warm, keep your outdoor activity to the cooler parts of the day and ensure your pup has access to plenty of fresh, cool water.  \n\nAnd while a Great Pyrenees does best in cooler locations, that doesn’t mean they should be left outside in freezing temps (or outside alone at all). Find a happy medium where your dog is always comfortable.",
  "health_description": "The typical Great Pyrenees lifespan is 10–12 years, but there are some health issues to be aware of. \r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Great Pyrenees, like many large, deep-chested breeds, are prone to a condition called bloat, when the stomach fills with air or food. A life-threatening complication of bloat is GDV, when the stomach twists on itself and cuts off blood supply to the organs. Symptoms include abdominal distension, restlessness, excessive drooling, and dry heaving. If you notice these signs, go to the vet immediately.  \nDeafness: Congenital deafness can appear in any breed, but it’s more prevalent in dogs with white skin and fur, like the Great Pyrenees. While there’s no cure for this condition, deaf dogs can do well in calm homes. \nEye issues: There are several eye conditions that Great Pyrenees dogs can develop. \r\n\n\t• Canine multifocal retinopathy is a genetic eye disease that can lead to vision loss.  \nCataracts in dogs look like an opaque lens in the eye and may cause blindness, but surgery can remove them. \nEntropion is when the eyelid grows inward, causing the eyelashes to rub against the cornea, causing ulcers; surgery may be needed to correct it. \r\n\nHip and elbow dysplasia: Common in large breeds, dysplasia is where the joints don’t fit together properly, whether it’s the hip or elbow. Treatment may include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication, physical therapy, and/or surgery. \nLuxating patella: In dogs with a luxating patella, the kneecap can pop out of place, resulting in lameness, pain, and eventually arthritis. Surgery is needed in severe cases. \nNeuronal degeneration (NDG): NDG is a genetic disorder that causes changes to your dog’s nervous system and eventually makes it difficult for pups to have control over their movements. Symptoms can include a loss of coordination, slipping or sliding in the hind legs, and falling. There is no cure or treatment, although genetic screening testing is available for Great Pyrenees puppies.",
  "history_description": "The Great Pyrenees has roots in the Pyrenees Mountains that divide France and Spain. Their lineage is ancient—their origins have been traced back as far as the Bronze Age, or 1800 to 1000 B.C.E. \n\nOriginally bred to herd and guard sheep and other animals, Great Pyrenees were eventually embraced by French royals and the noble class, who put them to work as guardian dogs in castles in southwest France. King Louis XIV even bestowed the special moniker “Royal Dog of France” upon the Great Pyrenees breed. \n\nEngland’s Queen Victoria also had a Great Pyrenees, and French military officer the Marquis de Lafayette, who served alongside George Washington during the American Revolution, brought the breed to the U.S.  \n\nRecognized by the American Kennel Club in 1933, today’s Great Pyrenees are valued family members, though they’re still sometimes found working on farms.  \n\nGreat Pyrenees puppies cost anywhere from $1,750–$2,500 or more. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder.  \n\nYou can also adopt a Great Pyrenees dog. To find your best buddy, look for a Great Pyrenees rescue like National Pyr Rescue, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter or on their social media, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
