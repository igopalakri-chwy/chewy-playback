  "breed_intro": "Looking for a high-energy bestie who's eager to play all day with you? Meet the Leonberger. Tell them it's time for an adventure, and these regal dogs will be wagging their tails in the backseat of your car before you've even checked the weather app for rain. Speaking of which, rain-schmain—with that water-resistant coat, a little wet weather won't dampen their day. While you're out and about, be sure to snap some pics for your IG feed. That glorious coat and happily wagging tail will make picture-perfect memories to cherish for a lifetime.",
  "appearance_description": "With their thick, richly colored coat and regal bearing, the Leonberger may remind you of a king—of the jungle. Often called a \"gentle lion,\" these dogs are distinctive. Their face and head are marked with a black mask, and their sturdy chest gives them a powerful appearance. Their brown eyes shine with warmth and affection for their loved ones. Be sure you're steady on your feet when their furry tail starts wagging—you might just get knocked over.",
  "temperament_description": "The Leonberger is known as the \"gentle lion\" for good reason. These pups are playful, tender and affectionate. They are not independent dogs, preferring to be included in all your fun. Leos are very loyal and sensitive to your mood; if you need a hug, they'll likely want one, too. Their gentleness and sensitive nature make them excellent therapy dogs, as they're willing to share their love and gentleness with everyone, not just their family.\n\nLeos aren't known to be aggressive or biters, but they need socialization starting when they're puppies to bring out their naturally friendly nature. If they're not socialized as puppies, these dogs may become wary around new people and situations.\n\nLeos love kids and are great playmates, but you'll need to supervise them around small kids and babies. This giant-sized dog weighs well over 100 pounds, and they have a strong tail. One happy wag in the wrong direction could topple a tiny tot.",
  "care_description": "The Leonberger breed is a very large dog with very large care needs. With their thick, double coat, it should come as no surprise that they're heavy shedders, and their fur will need a lot of care to prevent matting, too. These pups have a lot of energy and need a lot of training, as well. So, you'll be spending a lot of time with your pup every day—and that's just how you both prefer it.",
  "grooming_description": "The Leonberger has a thick double coat and is a super-shedder, so they require daily brushing using a pin brush to get down to the undercoat to remove all the mats. You may want to add an additional brushing where you dedicate serious time (30 to 60 minutes) to really brush through the fur and make sure your pup's coat is tangle-free. Many dog parents find it helpful to brush the coat backwards first to get next to the skin, then follow with a brush in the direction of the hair growth. In the spring and fall, when the Leo sheds their coat, use a metal comb and an undercoat rake in addition to the pin brush to deal with all the fur that will be flying.\n\nYour Leo will need a bath about every four to six weeks, unless they've been trekking through the mud. In between baths, you should be able to maintain their water-resistant coats with regular brushing.\n\nTheir nails will need to be trimmed about every two to three weeks, if not worn down naturally by all your outdoor fun. You'll know they're ready for a trim when you can hear your dog click-clacking on your kitchen floors.\n\nLeo's need their teeth brushed daily. Start when your Leonberger's a puppy, so they'll get used to it faster. Regular brushing will help keep tartar and plaque at bay and prevent other health issues, like heart disease, as they age. Your pup will need an annual cleaning by your vet, too.",
  "training_description": "The Leonberger dog is super-smart and eager to learn, which can make them enjoyable to train. However, when they hit their adolescence, they can sometimes think they're smarter than you and become a bit willful during training. This, coupled with the dog's massive size and energy levels, make them better suited to someone who's trained a dog before. These traits can be super frustrating to someone working with their very first dog.\n\nStart your Leonberger puppy with the basic obedience commands, like sit, stay and come. Learning how to walk nicely on a leash is important for your Leo to learn, too. These dogs were used to pull carts, so they're strong. If your adult pup takes off while on a walk, you may risk injuring your shoulder. So, teach them proper leash etiquette while they're a puppy—your dog and your arm will thank you. The off command may also be beneficial to help keep your 170-pound dog off your furniture or bed.\n\nSocialization is important, even for friendly pups like the Leonberger. Get them used to meeting new people, pups and situations to help them realize this is a perfectly normal part of life as they grow up. Take your puppy on walks and let them meet and sniff the people and dogs you meet. Enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new adults all under one roof.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Leonbergers usually do well with a high-quality commercial dog food for large-breed dogs. Be sure to choose a formula for your dog's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). Look for the statement on the packaging that says it meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.\r\n\r\nEven though the Leonberger dog is very active, be careful not to overfeed your pup. Extra weight adds extra stress to their bones, and obesity can lead to other health concerns like arthritis or heart disease down the road. As you plan mealtimes, don't forget to include all the treats you'll give during training and just because you love your dog—those calories count, too.\r\n\r\nLeonbergers are at risk of bloat, which can be life-threatening. To protect your pup, consider feeding your dog smaller portions throughout the day using a slow feeder bowl, and avoid strenuous exercise for an hour before and after mealtimes.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your dog's diet or feeding schedule, chat with your vet. They're in the best position to help you choose the right food for your pup based on their unique situation.",
  "exercise_description": "The Leonberger is an extra-large dog with extra-large exercise needs. This high-energy pup needs at least two hours of exercise spread throughout the day. A happy Leo is a tired Leo, and if your pup doesn't get the energy-releasing activity they crave, they'll come up with their own entertainment—such as destroying your favorite pair of running shoes (among other things).\n\nWhile long walks are good, be sure to mix it up so your pup doesn't get bored. Your Leo will love joining you for a morning jog, a weekend hike (so many things to smell and discover!) and games of Frisbee or fetch in the backyard. They're good swimmers and will enjoy splash time in a lake, pond or pool; in fact, they're well-suited to jobs as water rescue dogs. Be sure to reserve those more strenuous exercises, like jogging, until they're fully grown (around 2 years old). Their growing bones and joints need TLC, and that type of exercise may be too much for a puppy. Check with your vet before starting up a new activity.\n\nIf you've got a competitive streak, your Leo would love to join you in dog sports. They're great at agility courses and drafting, where they use their strong bodies to pull a cart competitively. (They were used to pull ammunition carts during both World Wars.) You two will have fun bonding over these fun sports, and who knows? You may come home with some fancy winning ribbons.\n\nDon't forget to exercise your pup's mind, too. After you've mastered the basics of obedience, teach your dog fun tricks, like play dead and shake (instant party pleasers!). And leave a few puzzle toys around the house for them to solve.",
  "ideal_environment": "The Leonberger is a giant breed who needs lots of room to speed around. They were bred to work on farms, so they're most at home in wide, expansive spaces. If you don't have oodles of acres for this pup to roam around, a fenced backyard will do nicely. With their giant size and really high energy levels, apartment living may be more challenging for these pups. Apartment-dwellers committed to spending lots of time outdoors every day may be able to make it work, though.\r\n\r\nBecause of their size and energy levels, these dogs are better suited for experienced pet parents who've trained a dog before. First-timers may find this pup a lot to handle and may get frustrated.\r\n\r\nThese gentle lions are family dogs and aren't meant for independent living. They need to be included in all the family fun. They thrive with an active family who's busy outdoors and wants a furry companion to bring with them on all their adventures.\r\n\r\nLeos are great with kids, but you'll want to supervise them around smaller children. With their large size and tail that's bound to be wagging, they may accidentally knock over a toddler. They do well with other dogs in the home, but watch out for smaller pups—they may accidentally injure them, too. Leos can do well with cats, as long as they're raised with them from puppyhood.",
  "health_description": "The Leonberger can live a healthy and happy life for such a large dog, with a life expectancy of 7 years. But, like all dog breeds, the Leonberger can be prone to certain diseases. Being aware of these conditions can help you give your pup a long and healthy life.\r\n\n \t• Bloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): This condition often affects large, deep chested dog breeds like the Leonberger. When it occurs, your dog’s stomach may twist and trap gas inside. Symptoms include a distended stomach, unsuccessful attempts at vomiting and restlessness. Bloat can be a life-threatening condition, so get to your vet immediately if you think your pup has symptoms. As a preventative measure, your vet can perform surgery to stitch the stomach to the side of the body (prophylactic gastropexy). You can also potentially help prevent bloat by avoiding exercising your dog immediately after eating and giving smaller meals throughout the day with a slow feeding bowl.\nDysplasia: As large dogs, Leonbergers are prone to hip and elbow dysplasia. Dysplasia is a hereditary condition in which the joint is malformed, causing the dog pain. Symptoms of dysplasia include limping, pain and arthritis. Treatments include weight and exercise management, physical therapy or surgery.\nEye Disease: Leonbergers are prone to a few eye diseases. Cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) both lead to blindness. Cataracts can often be corrected with surgery, but PRA does not have a cure or treatment. Entropion, in which the eyelid rolls inward and rubs, can lead to corneal ulcers and is treated with surgery. Ectropion, in which the eyelid rolls outwards, is often treated with medicated eye drops.\nPolyneuropathy: This is a progressive neurological disease that affects the nerves of your dog. Signs can appear from 1 year old. This can cause your dog to tire easily, be unsteady on their paws and have noisy or labored breathing. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to cure the disease, but medication can be given to manage the symptoms.\nDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): This often-inherited heart condition results in an enlarged heart, causing thin and weakened heart muscle. This can lead to heart failure. Treatment is typically daily medication.",
  "history_description": "Unlike most other working dogs, which are typically bred for physical labor, the Leonberger was bred to be a companion for European royalty. The breed was founded by Heinrich Essig, a 19th century politician and entrepreneur of Leonberg, Germany. He crossed large working breeds such as Saint Bernards and Newfoundlands, and their offspring served rulers such as Napoleon III, Tsar Alexander II of Russia and the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII of the United Kingdom).\r\n\r\nThe Leonberger has also graced households of elites, including composers Richard Wagner and Sergei Rachmaninoff and the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi. Over time, Leonbergers became working-class dogs who served on farms and other less aristocratic households. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010 and is the club's 167th breed.\r\n\r\nSo where's the best place to find a Leonberger puppy? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The cost of a Leo is between $2,000 and $4,000 which is on the higher end of the scale for the price of a puppy, but oh so worth it! For this price, they'll typically come screened for potential health and behavioral issues and may even come with papers. But you'll need to be patient as these puppies are pretty rare. If you'd like to adopt a Leo, reach out to the Leonberger Club of America or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
