  "breed_intro": "Think of a Goldendoodle, and chances are two things come to mind: their curly-to-wavy coat and their perky personality.\n\nThese dogs love people, and their active social life makes them a great companion for families with kids, singles looking for a brewery buddy, and first-time pet parents who are new to raising a dog.\n\nBut know that no two Goldendoodles are alike. There are two sizes (Standard Goldendoodles are descended from a Golden Retriever and Standard Poodle, while Mini Goldendoodles have Miniature Poodle genes), and the exact balance of Golden and Poodle also impacts your dog’s personality and looks:\r\n\n\t• F1 Goldendoodles are a 50-50 mix of a Poodle and a Golden Retriever.\nF1b Goldendoodles have a F1 Goldendoodle parent and a Poodle parent. This means they’re 75% Poodle and 25% Golden Retriever, and therefore more likely to have tight curls and be more allergen-friendly.\nF2 Goldendoodles are puppies from two F1 Goldendoodles.",
  "appearance_description": "Goldendoodles look a bit like walking, tail-wagging teddy bears—this is especially true for Miniature Goldendoodles who, even when full-grown, weigh under 35 pounds. Their coat can be wavy or curly and come in a handful of colors, though shades of gold are the most common.\n\nSmaller Mini Goldendoodles may look cute and compact, while a Standard Goldendoodle has a larger, more athletic appearance (while still looking adorable).",
  "temperament_description": "The Goldendoodle’s personality is part of what makes them such a popular family dog. These friendly pups love to meet new people and thrive from contact with humans.\n\nLike any dog breed, early socialization is still important for Goldendoodle puppies to learn good manners, like greeting politely rather than jumping on guests. With patient obedience training, a Goldendoodle is often a good playmate for other pets and kiddos.\n\n“Their prey drive tends to be low, making them less likely to chase or herd smaller animals or kids,” says Erin Askeland, MSc, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, and Camp Bow Wow's animal health and behavior consultant.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that a Goldendoodle puppy might have loads of energy that could overwhelm small children. This is especially true in the case of a larger Standard Goldendoodle, who may be more likely to knock over young kids with their playful antics. All puppy-child play sessions should be supervised.\n\nBut vigilance is always important—not just during playtime. Askeland says this breed is known to grab and eat non-edible items, like socks or tissue paper, so be cautious of the objects you leave within easy reach of your Goldendoodle. Puppy-proofing your home is a smart idea.",
  "care_description": "Goldendoodles are easy to get along with, but they’re not exactly the most low-maintenance dog breed.\n\nThey have plenty of energy and enthusiasm that needs to be channeled into exercise and fun, interactive training sessions every day. Plus, that curly coat calls for regular grooming.",
  "grooming_description": "To keep your Goldendoodle’s coat looking trimmed and tidy, you’ll need to commit to regular visits to the groomer.\n\nA groomer will give your dog a bath, a haircut, a nail trim, and an ear cleaning. Even if you keep up with routine brushing at home—which you should do at least a few times each week—it’s a good idea to regularly enlist the help of a professional groomer.\n\n“Sometimes it’s hard to find mats between toes or at the base of the tail,” says Jess Rona, a professional dog groomer in Los Angeles. “Groomers look at every small section of the coat and do a much more thorough job.” \n\nWhile there are many takes on how to groom a Goldendoodle, Rona has these words of advice: “The shorter the coat, the lower maintenance it is.”\n\nA Goldendoodle with a long and fluffy coat is striking, but there will be significantly more work required to keep them free of tangles and matting. A puppy cut, which involves trimming the coat to the same short length all over the body, is a popular Goldendoodle haircut. So is the teddy bear cut, which gives your Goldendoodle a short trim with longer, fluffier fur on the ears, paws, and face.",
  "training_description": "Goldendoodles are a cross between two of the smartest dog breeds and are typically eager to follow your cues. This can make a Goldendoodle an easy-to-train pup, but patience is still a must.\n\nGoldendoodles “can also be more challenging [to train] due to their energy level and curiosity—in other words, their attention span can often be short, which can be frustrating for some pet [parents],” says Askeland.\n\nThe best approach for training a Goldendoodle? Patience, positive reinforcement, and a pocket full of high-value treats.\n\nFirst-time dog parents who have the commitment and patience to work with an energetic breed will likely be impressed by a Goldendoodle’s smarts. These dogs can easily master basic obedience cues, like “leave it” or “stay,” but also grasp other skills that you might teach your dog for fun, like putting dog toys in a basket or bringing you a special item.\n\nIf you need help getting started with training, enroll your Goldendoodle puppy in obedience classes or find a certified dog trainer.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best dog food for Goldendoodles is a high-quality formula that’s nutritionally complete. When comparing foods, look for the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) certification seal; this ensures the food is complete and balanced. \n\nRemember that the nutritional needs of your Goldendoodle puppy will change as they grow. Because of this, always choose a food fit for their current life stage.  \n\nGoldendoodle puppies need a food that supports the rapid growth and development of this life phase. Ask your vet about the best puppy foods. Around their first birthday, your pup should switch to an adult food. Your vet may recommend senior dog food when your dog turns 7.\n\nMost full-grown Goldendoodles do well with twice-a-day meals. Younger pups, especially Miniature Goldendoodle puppies who are at risk of low blood sugar, may need to eat more often. Again, your vet can give you the best guidance.",
  "exercise_description": "Goldendoodles may look like teddy bears, but they’re active dogs who need daily exercise and mental stimulation to be their happiest selves.\n\nGet your throwing arm ready, because chances are your Goldendoodle will always be down for a game of fetch. Their parent breeds were both bred to retrieve birds, after all! Other favorite pastimes include walks around the neighborhood, learning new tricks, and solving puzzle toys.\n\nYour Goldendoodle’s size will play a role in how much exercise your pup needs, as a Standard Goldendoodle is likely to have a bit more stamina than a Mini Goldendoodle. Your pup may need anywhere between one and two hours of exercise every day.",
  "ideal_environment": "The perfect home for a Goldendoodle is one that:\r\n\n\t• Showers the dog with affection\nPrioritizes daily exercise and mental stimulation\nHas an active social schedule, and their pup’s always on the invite list\r\n\nBecause this breed is well-known for being good-natured and adaptable, a Goldendoodle is a great choice as a family pet. The petite size of a Miniature Goldendoodle makes these dogs ideal for smaller homes like an apartment or condo, while a larger Standard Goldendoodle will likely do better in a home with a yard.\n\nNo matter their size, Askeland says all Goldendoodles do well “with active families who can provide them a variety of ways to expend their physical and mental energy.” Goldendoodles are happiest when they are given attention, environmental enrichment, and regular exercise.",
  "health_description": "The average Goldendoodle lifespan is 10–15 years. Because smaller dogs tend to live longer than large dogs, Mini Goldendoodles may have a longer life expectancy than Standard Goldendoodles.\n\nGoldendoodles are generally healthy, but some health problems can pop up, just like with any breed. And as a hybrid dog breed, Goldendoodles are susceptible to inherited health issues commonly seen in Golden Retrievers or Poodles.\r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Standard Goldendoodles may be at risk of bloat, a serious condition when the stomach inflates with food and gas. When the stomach twists (GDV), it cuts off blood to important organs. GDV is a life-threatening condition and immediate vet care is needed if you notice the signs, which include retching, a distended abdomen, excessive drooling, and pacing.\nCancer: Golden Retrievers have an increased risk for certain cancers, which may be passed down to their Goldendoodle puppies.\nJoint problems: Issues like hip dysplasia or patellar luxation can affect Goldendoodles. Schedule a vet appointment if you notice limping or other mobility issues in your dog.",
  "history_description": "The Golden Retriever-Poodle mix surged in popularity in the 1990s, but both parent breeds have long and storied histories. Golden Retrievers were first bred in the Scottish Highlands to retrieve game for hunters on water and land. Poodles originated in Germany, where they were also developed as waterfowl retrievers.\n\nWhile the Goldendoodle is a popular dog breed, like other designer dog breeds, they aren’t recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).\n\nIf you’re looking to bring home a Goldendoodle puppy, work with a reputable breeder who prioritizes the health and happiness of their dogs. The precise Goldendoodle price varies by breeder, where you live, and the generation of your dog (an F1 Goldendoodle versus an F1b Goldendoodle, for example). But you can expect to pay $1,500–$3,500 or more.\n\nYou might also consider Goldendoodles for adoption. Research nearby Goldendoodle rescues, like IDOG Rescue, and keep an eye out at your local shelters. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs.",

    {
      "question": "Do Goldendoodles shed?",
      "answer": "All dogs shed, including Goldendoodles. But many Goldendoodles shed much less than other dogs, especially if they take after their low-shed Poodle parent. However, Goldendoodles with a wavy, Golden Retriever coat can shed more."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Goldendoodles hypoallergenic?",
      "answer": "Goldendoodles are often considered hypoallergenic dogs. But it’s important to know that all dogs contain allergens in their saliva, skin, and urine, so no dog is 100% allergen-free.\n\nF1b Goldendoodles are the most likely to be a good fit for people with allergies, as they are 75% Poodle and 25% Golden Retriever."
    },
    {
      "question": "How big do Goldendoodles get?",
      "answer": "The size of a full-grown Goldendoodle largely depends on the size of the Poodle parent. A Golden Retriever bred to a Standard Poodle produces the largest Goldendoodle, and usually weighs more than 40 pounds. The Mini Goldendoodle (with a Miniature Poodle parent) is smaller, at 35 pounds or less."

      "question": "Goldendoodles vs. Labradoodles: What’s the difference?",
      "answer": "When comparing a Labradoodle versus a Goldendoodle, the most significant difference is their DNA. A Labradoodle is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle, and therefore tends to have higher energy levels."
