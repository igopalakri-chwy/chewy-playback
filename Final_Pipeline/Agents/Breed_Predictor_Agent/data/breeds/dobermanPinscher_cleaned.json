  "breed_intro": "Though known for their imposing, tough-dog exterior, underneath you'll discover Dobermans actually have a heart of gold. Bred to serve as protectors, Doberman Pinschers have long-excelled as guard dogs and police and military dogs. But make no mistake: The Doberman Pinscher is a fun-loving, family-oriented dog with an up-for-anything personality, especially if it's a run around the neighborhood.",
  "appearance_description": "Sleek and muscular, Dobermans project a proud and powerful appearance. Black with rust markings is the most common of the Doberman colors, and the breed is generally solidly built and compact, with an attentive and observant expression.",
  "temperament_description": "Dobermans are highly intelligent, athletic and alert—all things that make them great guard dogs, which is what they were bred to do. And Dobies take their job as guard dog extraordinaire very seriously. This drive, along with their imposing physical appearance, has earned them a reputation of being notoriously protective. But when the pup parent provides the proper training, socialization and structure, these dogs are also a loving member of the family.\r\n\r\nYou'll soon discover that, along with their formidable presence, Dobermans possess a deep devotion to their people. In fact, they bond so deeply with their humans and are so dedicated to their families, these affectionate dogs are sometimes referred to as \"Velcro dogs.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to their work as guard dogs, Dobermans have a long history as police and military dogs, dating back to the early 20th century. Dobermans even assisted U.S. Marines during World War II.",
  "care_description": "Caring for a Doberman isn't rocket science, but there is definitely some work involved, as with any dog. While their grooming needs are fairly easy to keep up with, Dobies require a good amount of daily exercise and lots of training. With all that training and time spent together, you'll quickly build a tight bond with this super-smart dog.",
  "grooming_description": "Dobermans are a short-coated dog breed, and this will save you plenty of time when it comes to brushing. (The short coat will also make housework easier, as shedding is minimal.) Nevertheless, brushing is absolutely important and vital to maintaining a shiny, healthy and good-looking coat.\n\nYou should brush your Dobie a couple of times a week, and the sessions don't have to be very long—about 15 minutes (or less) will do the trick. Use a simple bristle brush to keep the coat clean and free of dandruff. Another excellent grooming tool for short-coated dogs is the KONG ZoomGroom, which removes loose hair and improves coat condition.\n\nA complete head-to-toe grooming session will take a bit more time. Like any dog, your Doberman will need to have their teeth brushed every day and their nails trimmed as needed (generally once month will do it). In addition to daily teeth brushing at home, it's a good idea to have your vet professionally clean your pup's teeth once a year. Baths are only needed occasionally to keep your dog smelling fresh or whenever they get exceptionally dirty from playing outside.\n\nThese grooming sessions not only help your dog feel and look their best but also allow you to look for developing health issues and spend some bonding time together—and we all know Dobermans LOVE quality time with their people.",
  "training_description": "Don't underestimate the importance of training your Doberman. Solid obedience training is essential for any dog, but it's especially important for Dobermans. Remember, these are large, powerful dogs.\n\nA martingale collar can be a useful training tool, as it contains two loops that tighten slightly (but not too much!) when the dog pulls. It can help give a pet parent additional control and help the dog learn not to pull on the leash. Dog harnesses are also helpful. If you're having trouble with your dog pulling on the leash during walks, this is a sign your dog may need more training.\n\nIf you're unsure about general obedience training, find a certified dog trainer in your area who uses positive reinforcement. They'll help lay the foundation and aid in molding your Dobie into a happy and well-mannered member of the home.\n\nHappily, Dobermans are very easy to train. They learn quickly and have even been called too smart. They can be sensitive to correction, so again, gentle and positive reinforcement is best. Take advantage of your Doberman's natural intelligence to help guide them toward your goals. Once they understand what's important to you, it will be important to them!",
  "diet_nutrition": "Dobermans need a complete and balanced dog food to ensure they remain at the appropriate weight and receive the proper nutrients. The choice of wet or dry food is really up to you, as long as it's a quality, balanced diet.\n\nAim to feed your Doberman on a set schedule and don't—if possible!—treat with \"human\" foods. That's a toughie, of course, especially when your Doberman gives you the \"I want some, too!\" face. But it's really for the best because those calories do add up. Just make sure you treat with \"dog-safe\" people food. (Find out what human foods aren't safe to feed your dog here.) Luckily, there are plenty of suitable treats made specifically for dogs. Treats are often an important part of training (and used to show your dog you love them), but again, you want to make sure you don't overdo them.\n\nYour vet is a great resource to help you determine the best food, feeding schedule and \"treat times\" for your individual dog based on factors like their age, weight and activity level.",
  "exercise_description": "Dobermans are highly energetic dogs who require plenty of exercise. Daily walks are essential, so get ready to put on your walking shoes because Dobermans need at least an hour of exercise a day to meet their needs.\n\nIf you're a runner, your Doberman will likely enjoy running with you several times a week. Dobermans have high energy levels, and they'll appreciate the exercise, provided you take it easy at first and build up to the desired activity level. Just like you, your dog needs to become fit for the task. Fun fact: A Doberman's top speed is over 30 miles per hour—much faster than you can run! So, taking your dog with you on a bike ride is a good way to help them really stretch their legs. Occasional off-leash play—in a fenced-in yard or dog park—is good, too. Many Dobermans also enjoy swimming.\n\nIn addition to physical exercise, Dobermans need mental stimulation. Dog puzzles, games, agility or similar activities will do the trick.",
  "ideal_environment": "Of course, with all that energy, your Doberman would love a nice, large fenced-in yard to run and play, but as long as you're meeting their exercise needs elsewhere, they can handle apartment life. Some might even appreciate time in an appropriately sized dog run.\r\n\r\nThe Doberman's ideal environment is a mixture of indoor and outdoor time. And activities with you are high on their priority list. Outdoor time is necessary for exercise and overall well-being, but they really want to be with their families, so being involved with the day-to-day activities inside the house is very important. Also, Dobermans are naturally lean and don't have the coat length to handle cold weather for long periods and can overheat on hot summer days.",
  "health_description": "Hopefully, your Doberman is a healthy dog who happily reaches their 10- to 12-year lifespan with little or no trouble. That said, there are some Doberman health problems and conditions that commonly affect this breed.\n\n \t• Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): DCM is an inherited disease that affects the heart muscle and is commonly seen in Dobermans. In dogs with DCM, their heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump blood effectively. Over time, this leads to heart enlargement (dilation) and can result in complications like abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), difficulty exercising and heart failure. Screenings should be done annually. Several drugs are used to treat the symptoms and help prolong life.\nVon Willebrand Disease: This is a genetic disorder that affects the ability of blood platelets to clot properly, which can lead to excessive bleeding from injuries. One study showed that over 70 percent of Dobermans are carriers, although not all show signs of the disease. Your veterinarian can screen your dog for it.\nWobbler Syndrome: This is a problem with larger dogs like Dobermans. Issues with the spinal cord in the neck cause considerable pain and may affect the legs (especially the hind legs). Dobermans may begin showing signs of the disease—like a lack of coordination—around age 6, and some are treated with medications while others may need to undergo surgery.\nHip Dysplasia: This is an inherited issue involving the hip joint that results in pain, muscle loss and lameness. It’s a degenerative disease, but there are many treatments and therapies available. Hip dysplasia can affect any dog, but it’s more common in larger breeds, such as Dobermans.\nBloat: Otherwise known as gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is a life-threatening condition affecting large breed dogs where the stomach fills up with food or air and twists.  The main symptoms include non-productive retching (trying to vomit but no vomit is produced) and abdominal distension.  If you notice these symptoms, please take your Dobie to the vet immediately.  Typically, emergency surgery is needed.\nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disease where the body does not make enough thyroid hormone.  Symptoms often include weight gain, hair loss, and lethargy. Typically it is diagnosed with a blood test and treated with daily medications.\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This inherited disorder results in vision loss and eventually blindness with no cure.  However, genetic screening testing is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
  "history_description": "So what is the origin of the Doberman dog? In 19th century Germany, a tax collector named Louis Dobermann decided he needed a dog to be his companion and protector as he went about his duties. He wanted a dog who would be loyal and strong but intimidating too. Over time, he developed the breed now known as the Doberman. (The breed was named for him, but with only one N.) Several breeds are believed to have influenced the Doberman's development, including the English Greyhound, the Black and Tan Manchester Terrier, the German Shepherd, the German Pinscher, the Weimaraner and the Rottweiler.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s, the Doberman breed had arrived in America, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1908. Doberman population growth in the United States was slow in the early years but received a boost thanks to George Howard Earle III, a Doberman enthusiast and politician. (He was later governor of Pennsylvania.) Earle was one of the founders of the Doberman Pinscher Club of America (DPCA), which was formed in 1921. The breed was admired for their excellent skills and qualities, especially as a protective and loyal guard dog. And the rest, as they say, is (Doberman) history.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s, a random albino mutation gene occurred, and while it resulted in a new color for the breed (white), the albino gene wasn't without its accompanying health issues. The specific gene has since been identified, and breeders can use a simple DNA test to help avoid albinism in Dobermans.\r\n\r\nToday, the Doberman is a popular family dog. Along with 30 other breeds, the Doberman Pinscher is part of the AKC's Working Group classification, which recognizes breeds that have historically performed jobs (search-and-rescue dogs or guard dogs, for example).\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Doberman puppies? You can find a list of reputable Doberman breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Doberman price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 for a pup. But for that, you usually are getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Doberman Pinscher rescue organizations to adopt a Doberman, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

    {
      "question": "Are Dobermans good with kids?",
      "answer": "A Doberman puppy and a small child probably aren't a wise combination, but an older dog and an older child can often coexist quite well, as long as you properly instruct the child on how to behave around dogs (and vice versa). Of course, every dog is different, and some may not be good with kids, but once a Doberman understands the child is part of the family, they usually shower the child with love and protection. Remember, always supervise your Doberman when interacting with a child."

    {
      "question": "Are Dobermans dangerous?",
      "answer": "Dobermans are strong, imposing dogs and may seem intimidating, especially to those outside their families, but they aren't considered more or less dangerous than other dog breeds. Like all dog breeds, Dobermans can display unwanted behaviors you'll need to address, but a reputable trainer can help you work through any issues. As noted, Dobermans can display protective tendencies, and they do have a strong bite force."
