  "breed_intro": "Big, beautiful Giant Schnauzers are scroll-stoppers of Instagram with their hallmark eyebrows and beards. Their smarts and cleverness make them fun to be around—especially when teaching them new tricks. Loyal and with stamina to spare, they are ideal companions for the \"work hard, play hard\" pet parent who leads an active life. Looks, intelligence and a competitive nature? Your pup will rarely leave your side, which is your reward for the love and devotion you give.",
  "appearance_description": "Giant Schnauzers are the largest of three Schnauzer types, with the Miniature Schnauzer and Standard Schnauzer being the other two. Exuding powerful determination and high energy levels, these handsome pups have dark facial masks and deep-set eyes that give them the look of a wise sage. Your Giant Schnauzer puppy sports a double coat—thick and wiry on the outside, soft and dense underneath—that's typically black or salt and pepper. Eyebrows, whiskers, cheeks, throat, chest, legs and under tail tend to be lighter in color but include characteristic \"peppering\" qualities.",
  "temperament_description": "Giant Schnauzers are amiable yet commanding, and were originally bred to work as guard dogs. The Giant Schnauzer size—and big bark to match!—might make them intimidating to strangers. But with family? They are wonderfully engaged, friendly dogs who want nothing more than to be with their pet parent.\r\n\r\nThey're highly intelligent—Giant Schnauzer puppies can be downright mischievous!—and if socialization and exercise needs aren't met, they'll make it their job to create a job for themselves that may be difficult to undo. Digging holes and destroying furniture or slippers are not unheard of! For this reason, make sure you give them a job to do that you actually approve of, like fetching your slippers or the morning paper.\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzer dogs can be good with older kids once they're properly trained and socialized, but these big dogs don't make the best of companions for small children that can easily (though accidentally!) be knocked over. Giant Schnauzers can also be trained to live happily with other furry family members, but make sure they're of the barking variety—best to steer clear of the meowing kind.",
  "care_description": "Giant Schnauzers need a higher level of exercise than most dogs. The same goes for mental stimulation, as well as the cost of extensive regular grooming (trimming, baths, teeth cleaning and nail trimming). The most distinctive Giant Schnauzer traits are their beard and brows—which give them a look of nobility—but they'll both need to be cleaned after every meal to catch drool and debris that naturally accumulate. But they'll repay your attentions with lots of love!",
  "grooming_description": "When it comes to grooming, Giant Schnauzers will need to be bathed within a four-to-six-week range to ensure their wiry coat is kept at its best. Their nails should be trimmed weekly—at a minimum. And after a day of your speedy Schnauzer running around, you'll need to pay mind to brush them thoroughly, especially their iconic beard and brows—it can get muddy out there!\r\n\r\nBrush your Giant Schnauzer's coat carefully with a large slicker brush or a pin brush with large bristles. Their long beards and mustaches will probably need to be washed or at least combed through with a small metal comb after most meals. Giant Schnauzers don't shed much, but daily brushing to remove outside debris or food is necessary.\r\n\r\nTeeth brushing should be done every day with toothpaste made specifically for dogs. Your vet can teach you how to brush; start when your Giant Schnauzer is a puppy so they get used to the routine. Otherwise, your nobleman will be at risk for gum disease and other dental problems. And as with all dog breeds, annual professional teeth cleaning by your vet (not your groomer) is mandatory.",
  "training_description": "As with most working dogs, Giant Schnauzers are born cooperative and by nature are incredibly engaged for training sessions. They'll be the star of the show at puppy school for sure!\n\nGiant Schnauzer training doesn't have to be obedience-based but it needs to be consistent. Giant Schnauzers need a job to do, and without one, they don't make a good first-time pet. As their pet parent, you need to find their motivations (praise, rewards or play) and dedicate training time every day—a combination of socialization with agility courses or a high-energy exercise like hiking—for best results.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Given that the Giant Schnauzer life expectancy is 12 to 15 years, you want that time with your pal to be the highest quality possible. Knowing the facts about diet and nutrition are key to longevity.\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzers do best on a high-quality commercial dog food appropriate to your Giant Schnauzer's size, height and age (puppy, adult, senior). Novice owners may be tempted to offer larger food portions because their pup has been working hard, but it's better to stick with a higher-protein diet and avoid a raw diet altogether.\r\n\r\nObesity can be a significant health problem in Giant Schnauzers. It may be hard to turn down their loving face and soulful eyes but resist the temptation to show your love with leftover people food or loads of doggie treats. Instead, give them a hug, brush their fur or teeth, play a game with them or perhaps take them for a walk. They want your attention and choosing activity over food will keep them at a healthy weight.\r\n\r\nConsult with your veterinarian to determine what brand of food, how much and how often your Giant Schnauzer should be fed.",
  "exercise_description": "Giant Schnauzers have energy to spare and need a higher level of exercise than most dogs. And they require a purpose or they'll create their own!\r\n\r\nPet parents who enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, running and swimming will find their furry friend is a worthy companion who can keep up with the best of them. Take your Giant Schnauzer on a daily 30 -to 45-minute walk to stimulate their mind with sights, sounds and smells. Or go the distance (literally!) and build a backyard course that has tunnels, jumps, A-frames and see-saws, and watch your Giant Schnauzer thrive!",
  "ideal_environment": "A working dog like the Giant Schnauzer is best paired with an active pet parent who's craving a buddy for a regularly scheduled 5 am run or hike. A family with older children who all like to have a dog by their side at all times is also ideal.\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzers are in their element when living in a medium-to-large size home in the suburbs, a large house in the country or on a farm. They're no couch potatoes, but then again, neither are you!\r\n\r\nGiant Schnauzers can be rambunctious and unaware of their own strength, and their size can be imposing to smaller dogs or pets. Giant Schnauzers may exhibit their innate herding tendencies naturally (if not given a more appropriate outlet for it) with multi-pet households; socialize them sooner rather than later with a puppy playgroup or training class to ensure they \"play well with others.\"",
  "health_description": "The Giant Schnauzer has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. Health problems are common in pure breeds, so it’s highly important to find a reputable breeder. The most common Giant Schnauzer health issues include: \r\n\n \t• Hypothyroidism: Giant Schnauzers are prone to hypothyroidism, a condition in which the body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Signs can include dry skin and coat, hair loss, weight gain or behavioral changes. Treatment is typically daily oral medication. \r\n \t• Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: A Giant Schnauzer’s size makes them prone to hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, both of which often result in arthritis. Early detection enables treatment to minimize pain, and in more serious cases surgery may be an option. Giant Schnauzer weight issues will only worsen dysplasia, so be sure to keep your pup lean. \r\n \t• Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD): This developmental condition occurs when cartilage does not turn to bone as it should during the growth process. This can result in pain and limping in young Giant Schnauzer puppies, often those 3 to 9 months of age. Surgery may be needed. \r\n \t• Bloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): The Giant Schnauzer’s size and the deep shape of their chest place them at higher risk for gastric dilatation and volvulus, also known as GDV or bloat. When a dog bloats, the stomach twists on itself and fills with gas. Left untreated, the condition is quickly fatal. If your dog retches or dry-heaves, acts restless, has an enlarged abdomen or lies in a prayer position (front feet down, rear end up) take your pet to an emergency hospital immediately! You can help protect your pup from GDV by feeding smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day using a slow feeding bowl. \r\n \t• Von Willebrand Disease: Von Willebrand disease is a blood clotting disorder frequently found in Giant Schnauzers. Ensure that your veterinarian performs diagnostic testing to rule out von Willebrand disease and other similar disorders prior to any surgical procedures for your beloved companion.",
  "history_description": "The Giant Schnauzer dog is the largest of the three Schnauzer breeds (Miniature and Standard being the other two). The Giant Schnauzer breed's origin dates back to 17th century Germany to the \"bear Schnauzer\" of Munich, a long shaggy-haired dog related to the Old German shaggy shepherd dog primarily tasked with cattle herding.\r\n\r\nThe Giant Schnauzer breed is a cross between the \"bear Schnauzer\" and black Great Dane, which accounts for their shorter hair and larger body, creating an elite working dog who can also serve as a family guard dog.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Belgian Bouvier des Flandres, Giant Schnauzers were originally bred to drive cattle from farm to market. The breed gained popularity after World War I and, since then, Giant Schnauzers have been trained to serve as police dogs, military dogs and search and rescue dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Giant Schnauzer gained American Kennel Club breed recognition in 1930, and the breed is a frequent competitor in the dog sports/competitions circuit. In modern times, the Giant is still bred throughout Europe as a companion and useful working dog rather than as a \"fancy\" breed.\r\n\r\nAre you considering a Giant Schnauzer as a pet? The cost for a Giant Schnauzer puppy ranges from $1,000 to $1,500 for a purebred. For that price, you're likely to get a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. To find reputable breeders, visit the American Kennel Club's website. To adopt a Giant Schnauzer, consider one of these Giant Schnauzer rescues or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
