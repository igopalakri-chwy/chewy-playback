  "breed_intro": "Looking for a pet who looks just as glamorous as you do (aka very)? The long-tressed Yorkshire Terrier might be the dog for you. The Yorkie's silky, human-like hair needs plenty of upkeep'we're talking conditioners, detangling sprays, brushes and bows! But these smart cookies will pay you back in loyalty, cuddles, playfulness, a feisty attitude and, of course, almost unbearable cuteness. Live in a city? Even better. Yorkies are adaptable dogs who do well in apartments and are portable enough to tote on the subway. Just be prepared to turn heads wherever you go.",
  "appearance_description": "The Yorkshire Terrier dog is one of those breeds who elicits squeals from almost everyone. They're just so darn cute! With their teddy-bear faces, round eyes, soft hair and tiny bodies, Yorkies are like plush toys come to life. Though they are born with mostly black hair, their coat turns more golden and gray (called \"blue\") as they age. Some Yorkie parents let these golden locks grow long; others keep them short. Either way, your Yorkshire Terrier will be the definition of super-cute.",
  "temperament_description": "Though small and cute with flowing locks, the Yorkshire Terrier is a smart, spunky dog who isn't aware of their diminutive stature. Originally bred to hunt rodents before becoming popular as lapdogs, the Yorkie retains much of that tough terrier 'tude (and bark) today. These confident pups might just take full command of the household if you let them, not-so-gently letting you know when it's time to wake up, put the food out and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this smart breed is eager to please, making them a quick study when it comes to dog training. With early training and plenty of opportunities for social interactions with humans and canines from a young age, Yorkies can be a loyal, playful and friendly best bud. However, they aren't great with young kids and babies'or, rather, young children aren't great with them, especially those who like to play rough and haven't been taught how to respect a dog's boundaries. As with any dog, be sure to supervise encounters to ensure a safe and positive playtime.\r\n\r\nYorkshire Terriers don't mind being handled and carried, so they're some of the most portable pups around. But be careful not to coddle them too much. Yorkshire Terriers still need exercise and independence so that they don't grow afraid to be out of your arms. In fact, because Yorkies bond so closely with their people, many Yorkie parents get two so they can keep each other company.",
  "care_description": "Yorkshire Terriers may be small, but that doesn't mean they need any less care than larger canines. Their hair alone requires lots of upkeep! Those silky tresses need plenty of brushing to keep from getting tangled and matted. You won't have to plan long exercise sessions, so instead, use this time to focus on grooming, cuddling and training.",
  "grooming_description": "If you're a wannabe hair stylist, the Yorkshire Terrier is the breed for you. A Yorkie's hair is fine and delicate, almost like a human's. Whether you let your Yorkie's hair grow long or keep it in a short haircut, aka a \"puppy cut\" (one to two inches all over), you'll need to brush it every day with a pin brush to avoid breakage and matting. While you're brushing your pup, check their eyes for discharge and clean it away with a soft, damp cloth.\n\nPlan on bathing your dog about once a month. After you shampoo your Yorkie, apply a conditioner'yes, this breed needs to be pampered'and then rinse. Many Yorkie parents spritz their dogs with a leave-in conditioner afterwards, too.\n\nAs you bond over a grooming session with your Yorkshire Terrier, check for signs of inflammation or infection (sores, redness, flaking, bumps, etc.) on their skin, paws and ears. Give those ears a good sniff, too; a foul odor can be a sign of infection. Call your vet if you notice any of these signs.\n\nBe sure to keep their nails trimmed. You may need to trim them every two to four weeks'you'll know it's time when you hear them clicking as they walk across hard surfaces.\n\nAnd don't forget to brush their teeth daily to help keep their teeth and gums healthy and reduce the risk of dental disease down the road. You'll want to make sure your vet professionally cleans your Yorkshire Terrier's teeth once a year too.",
  "training_description": "With high intelligence, Yorkies are quick-learning students who master commands and tricks easily through positive reinforcement, including praise, cuddles and treats. This breed is eager to please'Yorkies love soaking up accolades'so take advantage of this trait and throw in a party trick or two like twirling on their hind legs (why not?) along with the basic safety commands including sit, stay and come. In fact, Yorkshire Terriers excel at agility and obedience competitions. So if you're an aspiring Yorkshire Terrier Best in Show'type pet parent, start them young and get out that puppy training 101 manual!\n\nAn important part of training your Yorkie will be socializing them with other dogs and humans from an early age. It's tempting to pick these little cuties up and carry them everywhere instead of letting them interact with the world, but this can make them anxious'and anxious dogs are harder to train. Talk to your vet about when it's safe to take your Yorkshire Terrier puppy out on walks, and maybe even start puppy school, so they can learn some obedience at an early age and how to socialize around other dogs.\n\nYorkshire Terriers tend to be highly vocal so it's also worth investing time in working with them to curb excessive barking. You don't want that off-the-charts cuteness to be overshadowed by their noise levels.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Yorkshire Terriers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Make sure the food you choose meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials. (Look for the AAFCO statement on the package.) When selecting a food, factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nSince Yorkies are small in size, they don't need nearly as much food each day as, say, a Mastiff. But they do have very fast metabolisms, which might leave them feeling hungrier faster. Talk to your vet about possibly serving your Yorkie puppy three or four smaller meals per day instead of the classic morning and evening feedings. Your vet is in the best position to help you nail down a diet and feeding plan for your individual dog.\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire Terrier also loves a heavy dose of appreciation, especially in treat form. But while training treats are great for training, you don't want to overdo it. Remember that those little morsels of praise amount to calories, and even an extra pound can make a big impact on your dog's overall health. Treats should only constitute a small percentage (10 percent) of your pet's daily food.",
  "exercise_description": "Yorkshire Terriers don't need a ton of exercise needs to meet their energy level'unlike, say, Golden Retrievers'but they do need frequent and regular opportunities for movement and play, as much for their minds as for their bodies. Without exercise, this smart breed can get bored. Even a dog of this tiny size can make a mess of your neatly placed cushions... and possibly even just as guests arrive at the door. Two 15-minute daily walks is sufficient, but also keep puzzle toys at home to keep your Yorkie engaged and moving during the day. A living-room game of fetch or gentle tug-of-war is great, too. They also love the challenge of dog sports, like agility or conformation (dog shows), so feel free to get creative with how you exercise your little pooch.\r\n\r\nWhen you do go out and about together, remember not to speed walk'your Yorkshire Terrier's little legs can't keep up! Instead, be patient, and try to avoid resorting to picking up your pup, which deprives them of the exercise they need.",
  "ideal_environment": "You don't need a ton of space or even a yard to make a Yorkie happy. Of course they need to run and play, like any dog, but they can have a ball playing tug-of-war right in your apartment living room. As loving companions, they'll also appreciate a comfy couch and a welcoming lap, and you can use these up-close-and-personal moments to give your pooch a lengthy grooming sesh, which is so important for this breed.\r\n\r\nYorkies can tolerate other dogs and cats if they are raised together, and they can do well with children as long as both dog and child are taught how to behave around each other. Work long hours outside the home? A Yorkshire Terrier may not be the best fit for you, unless you can bring your Yorkie with you. This breed bonds closely with their human and likes to be by their side (or better yet, on their lap).\r\n\r\nYorkshire Terriers don't love extreme heat or cold, but who does, really? As long as you've got a good dog sweater in the winter and carry plenty of water in the summer, your Yorkie should be fine during your short walks.",
  "health_description": "Your Yorkshire Terrier will likely lead a perfectly healthy life with a generous lifespan of 11 to 15 years, but all dog breeds are at risk for certain health issues. Being aware of them may help you recognize any concerns'and get treatment'sooner.\r\n\r\n \tCollapsed Trachea: The Yorkie dog breed is prone to collapsed trachea, which is defined as a flattening or weakening of the trachea (windpipe) and can make it difficult for your dogs to breathe. Treat their neck carefully using a harness or a properly fitting collar (be sure two fingers fit snuggly between the collar and your dog's neck) to protect the trachea. Depending on the severity, treatment for a collapsed trachea may include lifestyle changes, cough suppressants, anti-inflammatories and, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tHypoglycemia: Yorkie and other toy breed puppies are at the highest risk before the age of 5 months for hypoglycemia. This condition causes a sudden drop in blood sugar which appears as drowsiness/lethargy, vomiting, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, tremors and seizures. Call your vet ASAP if you notice any of these symptoms; depending on the severity, supplemental glucose, IV fluids and even a hospital stay might be needed.\r\n \tPeriodontal Disease: The Yorkshire Terrier's short nose, small mouth, crowded teeth and genetics predispose them to dental disease. Their teeth are often overcrowded, leaving plenty of nooks and crannies for plaque and bacterial growth, which can lead to dental and gum disease. Familiarizing your Yorkie with dental care at a young age is best. Make sure to brush your Yorkie's teeth every day, check their gums regularly for swelling/redness and note any plaque on the teeth or even bad breath.\r\n \tLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease: A rare and likely genetic disease of the hip joint and connecting femur bone, Legg-Calve-Perthes usually develops in the first year, causing pain and limping. Serious cases may require surgery, and most Yorkies make a full recovery after treatment.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: This common issue in toy breeds occurs when the dog's kneecap pops out of place, resulting in a limp. Your vet can screen for this issue with a standard patella evaluation. If patellar luxation occurs in your Yorkie, talk to your vet about whether surgery is needed to correct the problem.\r\n \tProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): The Yorkshire Terrier breed is also genetically at risk for abnormal development of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. PRA can be seen in puppies (less common) or in adult dogs with a slow progression of the disease. Most dogs will be born with normal retinal tissue, and then slowly they will lose sight, very often first observed with difficultly seeing at night and leading to blindness. Management of the disease focuses on preventing injuries that come with vision decline, e.g. more lighting for your dog's space (inside and outside), maintaining a regular furniture configuration in the home, using safety gates to prevent stair use and working on leash training. Yorkies with low to no vision can thrive, leading very normal happy lives.",
  "history_description": "Like the name suggests, the Yorkshire Terrier is a terrier who has their origin in'you guessed it'Yorkshire, England, in the mid-1800s. These dogs are likely descendants of the Scottish Terriers, brought to the area by Scots who came looking for jobs. Like most terriers, Yorkies were bred to hunt and kill small vermin. In their case, Yorkies were probably put to work in mines ratting out, well, rats. By the late 1800s, this working-class, soot-snouted little dog captured the attention of the posh Victorian ladies of the day, who cleaned them up and made them proper lapdogs.\r\n\r\nThe pups made their way to the US, and the American Kennel Club recognized the Yorkshire Terrier breed in 1885. During World War II, Smoky, a Yorkie found by an American solider in New Guinea, accompanied US troops on their missions in the South Pacific and was credited with 12 combat missions and awarded eight battle stars.\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire Terrier Club of America was founded in 1951. Today, they remain a popular family pet.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to get a Yorkie as a pet? You can find responsible breeders at the AKC's website. A Yorkshire Terrier puppy can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000. For this price, you're typically getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperamental concerns and may even come with papers.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to a Yorkshire Terrier rescue organization to adopt a Yorkie, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy's database of adoptable dogs in your area.\r\n\r\nPro tip: If you're looking for a Yorkie with white in their fur, you may be looking for a Biewer Terrier, a close cousin to the Yorkshire Terrier. Also, some unscrupulous breeders may advertise \"teacup\" or \"tiny toy\" or \"extreme tiny\" Yorkies, which are dangerously bred to weigh less than three or four pounds. Yorkies are already a Toy breed, and these other names are simply a marketing ploy.",
