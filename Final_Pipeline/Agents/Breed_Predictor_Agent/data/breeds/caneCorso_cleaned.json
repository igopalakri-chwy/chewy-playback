  "coat_length": "Cani Corsi coats are short and stiff.",
  "ears": "The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard allows for the ears to be cropped or uncropped. Ear cropping involves surgically cutting away the outer part of a dog’s ear. Many countries and states have banned it for medical and behavioral reasons, and some veterinary groups, including the American Veterinary Medical Association (AMVA) oppose this cosmetic procedure.  It’s best to leave your Cane Corso’s ears as nature intended—floppy and cute.",
  "eyes": "Cani Corsi have almond-shaped eyes that are dark brown, though lighter shades are possible in gray-muzzled dogs.",
  "nose": "Their big noses are flush with the muzzle, and they’re black or gray.",
  "tail": "While the AKC standard still calls for Cane Corso puppies to have their tails docked, this practice is falling out of favor for welfare reasons, and you’ll now see Cani Corsi with long tails. Many groups, including AMVA, oppose tail docking, and several countries as well as U.S. states have banned the practice.",

  "breed_intro": "These big Italian pups—with soulful eyes to boot—are loyal friends with a devotion to their people. The Cane Corso (pronounced KAH-neh KOR-so) is a driven and strong-willed breed, but they’re very affectionate with their family.\n\nGrooming is a cinch with these giants, but training, as well as socialization, takes time. For that reason, Cani Corsi (the plural version of their Italian name) are best for pet parents with experience, patience, and persistence.",
  "appearance_description": "Once bred to be guardians, the Cane Corso is a sturdy, muscular giant who funnily enough begins life as an adorably floppy-eared puppy. As they age, they take on a more royal look—picture the elegant gaze of nobility.\n\nTheir impressive stature has made Cani Corsi stars on Instagram, where pet parents with the time and energy to give these dogs the best life show off their majestic pups.",
  "temperament_description": "You’ll never get bored with a Cane Corso around. They’re super smart and will react well to (and take seriously) all the training and socialization you do with them—but it is something you’ll need to devote significant time to.\n\nSince they were originally bred as guardians, the Cane Corso temperament still has a natural inclination to be slightly suspicious of the mailperson, the pizza delivery guy, or the Golden Retriever next door—possibly anyone who’s not you. So, it’s important to teach these sensitive souls that most strangers are safe, whether two-legged or four-legged.\n\nThe good news is that they’re smart and learn quickly. And with members of their own family, the Cane Corso is likely to be exceptionally affectionate and embrace you as their own.",
  "care_description": "Cani Corsi are low maintenance in the grooming department, which balances being fairly high maintenance where exercise and training are concerned. Their large size requires room to spread out, and their energy and intensity need plenty of fenced-in space for exercise.",
  "grooming_description": "Introduce your Cane Corso dog to bathing and brushing early on (as a puppy is ideal) and get tooth brushing and nail trimming in there, too.\r\n\n\t• Bathing: An occasional bath whenever your Cane Corso gets stinky is enough to keep their coat sleek and clean. Use a good pet wipe between baths to keep them from smelling.\nBrushing: With their short, stiff coat, shedding isn’t usually a problem, although you’ll want to keep a brush and a vacuum handy for seasonal shedding a couple times a year—particularly in the spring. Otherwise, a weekly brushing works.\nDental care: Brush your dog’s teeth every day to reduce the potential for dental disease later on. As with many large dogs, your Cane Corso will likely have an adorable drool, so keep a towel close to mop up messes.\nEar care: Check their ears regularly for redness, odd smells, or other signs of an ear infection.\nNail care: If you hear their nails clicking on the floor or sidewalk, it’s time for a trim. Plan to give them a little manicure once a month.",
  "training_description": "This breed is one smart cookie, and their brilliant noggins make them easy to train using positive reinforcement—that is, rewarding good behavior with treats, rewards, and praise. A delicious, high-value training treat, like American Journey Beef Training Bits, can keep their attention as you teach them new skills.\n\nThese pups thrive with trainers who can be patient and consistent from Day One. It’s best to begin training your Cane Corso puppy as young as possible—as early as 8 weeks old—but you can work with a certified dog behaviorist or trainer at any stage.\n\nIntroduce your Cane Corso to as many people and pets as possible when they first come home; it will help your pup be a productive member of society—and perhaps even a neighborhood favorite. \n\nRemember: Training is a commitment that must be maintained throughout a Cane Corso’s life, along with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The best food for a Cane Corso must be complete, balanced, and specialized for large or giant breeds. Choose a diet that’s AAFCO-compliant for your dog’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).\n\nFeeding a large-breed dog formula is important because these bigger breeds have different nutritional requirements for calcium and phosphorus than smaller dogs. Developing puppies must be fed a large- or giant-breed puppy formula to ensure the normal growth of bones and joints. Ignoring this advice can result in long-term orthopedic problems.\n\nAs always, talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s specific needs to find the best food for your Cane Corso. Your vet may also recommend joint supplements, like Zesty Paws Mobility Bites, especially if your pup begins to show signs of joint stiffness or lameness.\n\nFeed your full-grown Cane Corso two or three smaller meals throughout the day using a slow feeder bowl, which forces your dog to slow down and eat less in one gulp. This helps prevent life-threatening gastric dilatation-volvulus, which the breed is susceptible to. It’s also important not to exercise your dog within an hour of eating, either before or after meals.",
  "exercise_description": "Cani Corsi are known for their speed. But because they’re so big, they don’t quite zoom around the way other working breeds might. That doesn’t mean you and your Corso can kick back and be couch potatoes together, though. Your dog still needs long walks, as well as playtime and training for enrichment.\n\nA couple of miles a day, split into two or three shorter walks, will keep your Corso fit and keep their energy directed in a positive way. Don’t let colder weather deter you—a romp in the snow is an ideal way to burn their energy.\n\nAs a working breed, Cani Corsi are happiest if you can give them a job to keep them occupied. Obedience training, learning tricks, and dog sports can all be a source of joy.",
  "ideal_environment": "A home with enough space for exercising and training your pup is a must. At minimum, you’ll need a backyard with a tall, sturdy fence. Cani Corsi might not be cut out for romps with smaller pups at the dog park.\n\nIf raised with cats or other small pets from a young age, Cani Corsi will probably live happily with housemates. But these dogs often don’t know their own strength, so even well-intentioned play could cause unintended injury to kids and smaller animals, and their playful rambunctiousness could easily knock over an unprepared family member, especially older relatives.\n\nFor those reasons, these elegant, loyal pups might do best in an adult household where they are the only dog, or in homes with older children who help out with training.\n\nStrong, first-time dog parents committed to providing their new pet with a strong framework could adopt a Cane Corso successfully. Generally, though, Cani Corsi are best suited for pet parents with a bit of experience under their belt.",
  "health_description": "The Cane Corso lifespan is 9–12 years, but they may experience a few health issues over that time.\r\n\n\t• Bloat and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): The large, deep chests of the Cane Corso make them susceptible to bloat, which can trigger gastric dilatation-volvulus, a life-threatening condition where the stomach rotates and twists on itself. To help prevent this condition, your dog can have a gastropexy surgery when they’re spayed or neutered; it tacks the stomach to the abdominal wall so it cannot twist.\nEpilepsy: Epilepsy is a seizure disorder that typically starts between 6 months and 5 years of age. While it can be managed with medication, there’s no cure. That said, dogs can still lead a long and happy life.\nEye issues: Cane Corso dogs are prone to both entropion (in which the eyelid folds inward) and its opposite, ectropion (which causes the lower lid to fold outward). Another common problem is cherry eye, when the pink, fleshy part of the eye’s corner (the third eyelid) becomes swollen and bulges out. Discharge, squinting, cloudiness, bulging, and redness are all reasons to see your vet right away.\nHip dysplasia: A skeletal condition common to large-breed dogs, hip dysplasia is a malformation of the ball and socket joint, resulting in looseness. The condition causes mobility issues, pain, and arthritis. Large-breed puppy dog food and proper joint care can be preventive.\nObesity: With the already massive Cane Corso size, any extra weight will put added strain on their joints, leading to pain and mobility issues. A proper diet is crucial, as is daily exercise.",
  "history_description": "The Cane Corso traces its origins back thousands of years to a group of working breeds called Molossers, after an ancient Greek tribe that bred these big, Mastiff-type dogs to be guardians.\n\nAfter the Romans conquered the Greek Islands, they brought these dogs back to Italy, where they produced the ancestors of today’s Cane Corso. The Romans originally used the Cane Corso as pireferi—essentially, they were some of the world’s first military service dogs.\n\nAfter the Roman Empire dissolved in the 5th century, this Italian breed was used for hunting, herding, and even as guardians for farms. After two world wars, economic downturns, and an end to many family-owned farms, the breed nearly went extinct. \n\nFortunately, some surviving Cani Corsi were discovered in the 1970s, and a group of Italian dog fanciers set out to revive the breed. By the 1990s, Cani Corsi were making waves at dog shows across Europe.\n\nThey arrived in the U.S. in the late 1980s, and a few years later, the International Cane Corso Association was formed. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010.\n\nLooking to make one of these pups a part of your family? Cane Corso puppies typically cost between $1,800 and $3,000. If you choose this route, pick a responsible breeder.\n\nYou can also adopt a Cane Corso via a rescue organization (such as Cane Corso Rescue, Inc.), ask your local shelter if they have any Cani Corsi or mixes, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
