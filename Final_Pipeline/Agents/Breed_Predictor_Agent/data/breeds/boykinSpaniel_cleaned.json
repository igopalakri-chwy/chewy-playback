All these qualities can be found in South Carolina's best-kept secret: the Boykin Spaniel.

Did we mention that they're astonishingly good-looking? With their floppy feathered ears, dark wavy coat and soulful amber eyes, these Southern charmers are sure to steal your heart.",
  "appearance_description": "Boykin Spaniels convey their ready-to-go enthusiasm in their high-energy body language. Eyes alert, wise and watchful, tails wagging at warp speed, they move quickly with a happy sense of purpose, following their straight noses with determination. The colors of their coats cover a spectrum of solid browns and are fringed with light red. Sometimes, they have white patches on their chests, adding a dash of panache to this sturdy companion's confident bearing.",
  "temperament_description": "Boykin Spaniels have a sweet smile and a speedy, bouncy gait; and their personality tends to be high-energy and outgoing with a somewhat mischievous streak—don't say we didn't warn you! They're so lovable that their antics, however naughty, will still probably make your day.\r\n\r\nLooking for a family dog to add to your brood? Boykin Spaniels typically get along well with people, other dogs, cats and children. In fact, Boykin Spaniels are great for families with kids.\r\n\r\nSome Boykin Spaniels can be a little testy, but—as with a lot of breeds—this is often because they haven't been taught boundaries and rules. When it comes to biting tendencies, Boykin Spaniels don't bite any more or less than any other retrieving breed. Some might want to mouth you a little on the arm; but don't worry, they don't grip down—it's just their way of playing.\r\n\r\nBecause Boykin Spaniels were bred to be hunting dogs, their high energy level serves them well in jobs of that type. If you have one with a calmer disposition, they can do well as therapy dogs in places like schools and nursing homes.",
  "care_description": "Caring for a Boykin Spaniel takes time, but you'll love every minute you spend doting on these adorable pups, making sure they're eating right and that they have everything they need to stay healthy and busy. Plus, you get to have a blast charging through field, forest and stream with these energetic outdoor pals. Like you, they have a need for speed! Ready to bone up on caring for these beauties? Here's the 101 on Boykin Spaniel dogs.",
  "grooming_description": "Compared to other types of dogs, your Boykin Spaniel won't require too much grooming. They shed moderately year-round and a bit more heavily in the fall and spring. Here are some grooming tips for your Boykin:\n\n \t• Brushing: Brushing their medium-length coat once a week is usually enough to curb their shedding, but it's OK to brush your pup daily if you'd like. If your Boykin dog has a long coat, a set of combs and brushes will help you keep them looking gorgeous and mat-free. Invest in a stripping comb and a bristle brush, plus a steel comb for the coat on their ears. If they have a short coat, a bristle brush will do the trick, and a slicker brush will help remove mats and snarls from their coat.\nBathing: Too much bathing can dry out your Boykin's skin, so once every couple of weeks should be enough—unless they've been rolling around in the mud or splashing in a lake! If your pup's outdoorsy nature has been running wild, then it's bath time as soon as you get home.\nDental care: It's recommended by vets to brush your Boykin's teeth daily. Your vet can teach you how to brush your Boykin's pearly whites, and they should also give your pup an annual professional teeth cleaning.\nNail trimming: Nail trimming is also essential to keep your dog healthy and happy. (Hello, mani-pedi! Or is it pedi-pedi?) Your Boykin Spaniel's nails shouldn't touch the floor, so if you hear them clicking against it like they're the world's tiniest tap dancers, it's time for a trim. While some nails grow faster than others, trimming them once a month will usually be enough for Boykin Spaniels.\nEar cleaning: The main thing you need to look out for? Boykin Spaniels' long ears tend to hold heat, making them prime real estate for nasty stuff like yeast and bacteria. Check their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. If your vet recommends at-home cleaning, follow this step-by-step guide on how to clean dog ears.",
  "training_description": "Boykin Spaniels have amazing qualities and traits that make them highly trainable: They're smart, quick learners and eager to please their pet parents. That said, new puppies need a lot of supervision, so raising a Boykin Spaniel will definitely keep you on your toes. They can be very energetic, so don't be surprised to find they've chewed your new shoes when your back was turned. (If they suddenly become suspiciously quiet, that's a sign they might be getting into trouble.)\n\nBoykins are sensitive, so training that uses positive reinforcement (treats and praise as rewards for positive behavior) and is consistent and even-handed is the best way for them to learn. When working with Boykin puppies, it's important to make sure that both their minds and bodies are stimulated so they don't get distracted by things like, well, your new shoes. Get your Boykin something to chew on that's digestible, like Best Bully Sticks or other training treats. Avoid plush toys, which they could easily destroy and/or eat. When training a Boykin, it's often important to work on alone time so they can learn to be by themselves. You may find crate training helpful in teaching this.\n\nBoykin Spaniels are generally outgoing and not shy if properly socialized, so make sure you expose them to all kinds of people, furry friends and situations. Puppy school is a good place to start. It teaches your pup how to play nicely with other puppies—and their pet parents, too.",
  "diet_nutrition": "The Boykin Spaniel typically does well on high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nYour vet can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet. Allergies to foods like wheat can crop up in them, too, so check with your vet if you have questions about food sensitivities.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to specific nutritional needs, due to their active lifestyles, Boykin Spaniels may benefit from high-protein dog food. But again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the right food for your dog based on their individual needs. Always check with your vet before you share any people food with your pooch, too.\r\n\r\nTreats can help with training, but keep calories in mind, too. Obesity can lead to health issues like heart disease, so factor treat calories into their overall diet plan to keep your pup from gaining extra weight.",
  "exercise_description": "Boykin Spaniels love to exercise, from going on long walks and hikes to playing fetch, swimming and hunting. (Remember, they were bred to retrieve, so they'll excel at activities where they can do that!) They enjoy the water and would thrive in a home with a pool or a pond—just make sure they're properly taught how to get out of the pool, especially if there are no steps, and always supervise them when they're swimming.\n\nHow much daily activity is best for these high-energy pups? They'll thrive with vigorous exercise three times a day, for 10-15 minutes at a time. You should wait until they're about 9 months to a 1 old, though, before you take them running or jogging with you; strenuous activities before that time can damage their growing joints. You can also find a local agility course or hunt test club to put your pooch through their paces like a real pro. You might even find that you enjoy it as much as they do!",
  "ideal_environment": "Most Boykin Spaniels get along well with other animals when they've been properly socialized, although some have more of a prey drive than others. The larger their area is to run and play, the happier they'll be. A small home or an apartment are OK, as long as you're able to give them the exercise and outdoor activity they need.\r\n\r\nThey're a good choice for pet parents who've had previous experience with high-energy dogs and who can keep up with their exercise needs. You like exploring the great outdoors every chance you get? Perfect, so do they! So get ready to lace up those hiking boots and hit the trails or hop in a boat and play fetch in the water with your Boykin companion!",
  "health_description": "Boykin Spaniels have a life expectancy of 10-15 years, but they’re also prone to some health issues. It’s helpful to know what those potential health problems are in advance so you can keep your pup healthy for longer. \r\n\n \t• Exercise-Induced Collapse: Boykin Spaniels are prone to exercise-induced collapse, where a dog will collapse either during or right after intense exercise. Preventative treatment involves avoiding excessive exercise and ensuring that your dog is well-hydrated and doesn’t become overheated. \r\n \t• Eye Conditions: Boykin Spaniels are prone to several eye conditions, including Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) and juvenile cataracts. Both conditions can lead to vision loss. Genetic testing is available for both conditions, so be sure to discuss if your pup and their parents have been tested with any potential breeders. \r\n \t• Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a genetic disease affecting many dog breeds. It’s a deformity that occurs during growth and can be affected by factors such as diet and exercise. Treatment options can range from lifestyle changes like weight loss to surgery, depending on the severity of the dog’s condition. \r\n \t• Degenerative Myelopathy: This genetic spinal disease that gradually causes paralysis can affect Boykin Spaniels. Dogs can be tested to help determine their risk for the disease. Although there is currently no cure for degenerative myelopathy, treating other concurrent problems such as hip dysplasia or arthritis may make dogs more comfortable. A healthy diet and exercise that doesn’t stress joints, like swimming, are also important in preventing obesity, which can exacerbate the condition. \r\n \t• Patellar Luxation: Kneecap dislocation can cause pain and lameness. Treatment options can range from medications to surgery, depending on the severity. \r\n \t• Pulmonic Stenosis: Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital heart defect that can present as a heart murmur or with symptoms like exercise intolerance or fainting. Treatment typically involves passing a balloon catheter into the heart to widen the narrowed heart valve.",
  "history_description": "Boykin Spaniels have an impressive origin and history. They were originally bred for wild turkey and duck hunting in the swampy areas of South Carolina in the early 1900s. Word got around pretty quickly about these medium hunting dogs' high levels of physical and mental stamina—as well as their relentless work ethic—and they soon became so beloved in their home state that they've earned the title of the official state dog of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAlthough the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the Boykin Spaniel in 2009, their popularity has skyrocketed in the decade or so since thanks to their highly desirable characteristics and personality. Although they can be very focused on work, especially hunting, their friendly and happy-go-lucky nature has blossomed to the benefit of families who enjoy being active with these high-energy pets.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find Boykin Spaniel puppies today? The AKC's website offers a list of reputable breeders and contact information for them. What's the average Boykin Spaniel price? Expect to pay about $1,000 for a pup, although some are as much as $4,500 if you're looking for a high-quality performance or show dog. For that price, you're usually getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Boykin Spaniel rescue organizations to adopt a Boykin or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Or, search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

      "question": "Do Boykin Spaniels shed?",

You'll typically only need to brush their coats once a week, but you can brush them daily to get rid of loose hair and mats. They're not hypoallergenic, and they also have a double coat, so they probably wouldn't be the best choice for a pet parent with allergies."
