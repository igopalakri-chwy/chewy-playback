  "breed_intro": "The Weimaraner will stick by your side no matter what. And we mean it when we say no matter what: They'll stick to you like glue all day, every day. This dog breed craves attention and is happy to join in on any activity, from couch cuddles to park play dates, as long as they are with their human. And with such a high-energy breed, you'll want to make sure those activities include more outdoor adventures than not. These devoted family dogs eagerly keep up with active children and are fast learners, so don't be surprised when they discover how to open the treat cupboard with a nose nudge. Your Weim may be a permanent toddler, but that's OK—you'd take a busy life with this fun-loving dog over lazy days anyway.",
  "appearance_description": "Weimaraners carry themselves with a royal, aristocratic air. But don't let their characteristic gracefulness and smooth, shimmery coats in hues of gray, blue and silver-gray fool you. They are goofballs with long, floppy ears and protruding gray-tipped snouts that sniff out ways to sneak food from the kitchen countertop. And, their long legs can reach just about anything! It's easy to know when a Weimaraner is happy; their tail will flutter quickly as their bright, attentive eyes shine.",
  "temperament_description": "Weimaraner dogs are friendly and fearless. Their inquisitive personality can mean intently listening to your guidance when learning a new trick or running straight into a swarm of bees to see what all the buzzing is about. So, stay alert!\n\nSpend one day with a Weimaraner, and you'll quickly discover their love for human and animal connection. But thanks to their tall height, lanky stature and fast speed, they can be a bit clumsy around unstable toddlers, the elderly and small pets. So make sure you keep an eye on your Weim when grandma comes for a visit.\n\nWeimaraners will experience separation anxiety when you're gone too long. Expect some judgy side-eye and a disheveled bed when greeting your Weimaraner at the door if you've been away for the day.\n\nA Weimaraner loves to use their mouth during playtime, whether engaging in a game of tug-of-war with their pet parent or nibbling a plush toy. If an unexpected bite happens, it's most likely from misjudging where your hand will go next, and the dog will often pause to apologize for the mistake.\n\nThis social breed loves to be out and about, from visits to friends' homes to public outdoor spaces. And they adapt quickly and find joy in poking their noses in whatever activity you're doing. Do you have a farm? Weimaraners love investigating other animals and might point at waterfowl, such as ducks and swans, thanks to their natural hunting capabilities. (So, make sure your birds are out of reach.)",
  "care_description": "If you've got treats, you've got an obedient Weimaraner. This breed thrives on food and the thought of getting food; so when it comes to working on leash training (they like to pull!), teaching a puppy to sit still for brushing or asking the dog to leave yard bunnies alone, having a pocket of yummy treats, like these bite-sized ones from Blue Buffalo, will muster their full attention. Fortunately for you, your Weim doesn't need a lot of grooming, so you can spend all that time training and playing with your pup.",
  "grooming_description": "Thanks to a smooth, short coat, a Weimaraner's grooming needs are simpler than some other breeds. Here are some grooming tips for your Weimaraner:\n\n \t• Brushing: This low-maintenance dog requires weekly brushing to remove loose hairs and keep their coat shiny and sleek. The rubber tines of a curry comb (like this one from ConairPro) glide down the back to remove loose fur leaving your pup silky smooth to the touch. Weimaraners are low-shedding dogs, but you'll notice more fur around the house in the spring and fall when their coat sheds the most.\nBathing: Bathing your pup once a month is plenty unless curiosity has led them to roll in muck or splash in mud puddles. Then, lather them up! To keep a Weimaraner's skin and coat healthy, opt for a dog shampoo that aligns with their needs, such as soothing dry skin, calming allergies or flea prevention.\nDental care: Just like humans, Weimaraners also need routine dental care and cleaning. Brush their teeth daily to keep their teeth and gums healthy. Your veterinarian can teach you proper brushing techniques. Be sure you schedule your Weim for an annual professional cleaning to remove plaque and tarter build-up.\nNail trimming: The toughest part of grooming Weimaraners is their toenails. They grow thick, long and fast. You know your pet needs a trim when the nails play a clicky-clack tune on hard floors when walking. Plan to trim their nails about once a month for regular maintenance, or have your vet or a professional groomer do it.\nEar cleaning: This breed is prone to ear infections due to the lack of airflow inside their signature ears. If you notice debris, redness or swelling, or if you smell an odor or see wax build-up, speak to your veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment. If they recommend at-home cleaning, check out our vet-approved guide for cleaning a dog’s ears.",
  "training_description": "Weimaraners rate high on the intelligence scale. Show them a new trick or task just a few times, and they learn it. This breed thrives on gathering information and putting it to use, making them excellent partners for competitions and social outings.\n\nWeims are eager to learn and need training to harness their exuberance during the puppy years. They respond best to positive-based training that uses praise, petting and treats within a structured course that builds upon techniques learned each session. You might find the assistance of a certified dog trainer or behaviorist especially helpful in these early stages.\n\nWeimaraner training should be consistent, regular and creative. For example, you can teach your dog that when you pull out their leash at night, it means it's time for obedience class, and they'll look forward to the training sesh. They may even remind you about the activity minutes before by waiting by the door or nudging the leash. You (or your trainer) should mix up the format of these training sessions or else your Weimaraner will get bored. Perhaps start some sessions with social time and other times go straight into training. Keep a Weimaraner guessing, and you'll have a focused dog.\n\nIt may be a little difficult for this breed to learn to walk on a loose leash or come when called. Offer rewards that appeal to their taste buds. Weimaraners have an excellent sense of smell and will pull toward dog treats. Use that to your advantage in training sessions.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Weimaraners typically do well on a complete and balanced diet of high-quality commercial dog food. When selecting a food, choose a formula that fits your dog's age and stage in life, such as puppy, adult or senior. If you're selecting a dog from a breeder, ask what brand and formula they were feeding the puppy. You may choose to continue with the same.\n\nYour veterinarian can provide additional nutrition information and help you create a feeding chart to determine how often and how much to feed your dog based on their specific dietary needs, age, size, activity level and health conditions. Treats are OK for Weimaraners in moderation. However, these quick snacks contain calories and can add up, leading to obesity.\n\nBecause Weimaraners are large-breed dogs, puppies benefit from calcium and glucosamine supplements to give their bones and joints the best support possible during their growing years. As a Weimaraner ages, feed them according to their body type (such as weight management food for those overweight) and metabolism (such as food for active dogs if they log lots of miles each week).\n\nA healthy-weight Weimaraner should have visible hips, a slender stomach line and one or two ribs showing from the rear view. Not sure if your dog is maintaining a proper weight or consuming the right nutrition? Consult your veterinarian, as they are the best resource to help you pick proper food for your dog based on their individual needs.",
  "exercise_description": "Weimaraners are energetic dogs. They crave movement and will enjoy going with you on a trail run, hunting trip, afternoon swim or participating in an agility trial.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, exercise for a puppy should equal about five minutes per month of age, twice a day. So, a Weimaraner puppy who's 4 months old should get 20 minutes of exercise two times a day. This might be in the form of a walk around the neighborhood in the morning and playtime at the dog park after dinner.\n\nAdult Weimaraners more than 1 year old can easily enjoy one to three hours of activity each day thanks to their high energy level. But don't be fooled! This physically active dog will coax you to stay out and about all day if you let them. You may need to remind them that sleep is important, too.\n\nWeimaraners are a working breed who excel at hunting. It's one of their best traits. If that's your weekend pastime, you've met your furry soul mate. To really connect, reward your pet with a tasty protein-rich snack (we recommend American Journey Beef treats) as you teach them how to track and retrieve.\n\nAs you're giving your Weim physical challenges, be sure to challenge their mind, too. Introduce them to agility-style games, training classes and puzzle toys to help keep them happy.",
  "ideal_environment": "Weimaraners are a fabulous family pet for active households in the city or country. These dogs do great with people of all ages but should be supervised around babies and toddlers. This breed's large size can accidentally knock down tiny tots when playing or running toward you for a treat.\r\n\r\nWeims are great as a pet for experienced pup parents. Their high-energy and quick mind means you'll need to stay one step ahead of them to keep them well-behaved and out of trouble. For the best behavior, get the zoomies and wiggles out with frequent visits to the backyard or local park. Weimaraners tend to love water and lots of land to roam, making them an ideal breed for rural dwellers who have a small pond on their property.\r\n\r\nWhen friends drop by or you host holiday dinners with extended family, a Weimaraner will act as your jubilant door greeter and happily sniff everyone who enters. They may even pick a favorite and try to be a lap dog to get extra close and personal.\r\n\r\nThese dogs get along well with other dogs. When it comes to feline friends, Weimaraners either ignore or chase these furry companions. If you have a cat in the home, it's best to make introductions before committing to raising a Weimaraner to be sure the two get along.",
  "health_description": "Weimaraners have a lifespan of 10-13 years, and, like any dog, they have a few health issues. It’s important to be aware of these health problems so you can help your pup live as healthy a life as possible. \r\n\n \t• Foreign Object Ingestion: One of the most common reasons Weimaraners land in the vet’s office is for eating something that’s not food. The best way to manage this situation is prevention. Keep small children’s toys, dirty laundry and other curiosities off the floor where the dog can get to them. If the dog does eat a foreign object, please take them to your vet immediately. In some cases, the vet can induce vomiting to recover the object. In other cases, the vet may use X-rays and/or an ultrasound to help determine if surgery to remove the object is needed.   \r\n \t• Hip or Elbow Dysplasia: Dysplasia occurs when the joints do not form properly and therefore do not fit together well. This can cause pain, lameness and arthritis. Treatment options will often include pain medication, weight management, joint supplements and, in severe cases, surgery.  \r\n \t• Bloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): This acute emergency occurs when the dog’s stomach rotates and becomes twisted in the abdomen. Symptoms typically include retching or dry heaving, distended abdomen and restlessness, which may present as pacing. Time is critical. If you think you may have a pet experiencing bloat, they need to be seen at the emergency vet right away. Emergency surgery is typically needed to correct the situation and save the pet’s life. \r\n \t• Entropion: This genetic eye condition occurs when the eyelids roll inward such that the eyelashes rub on the cornea of the eye itself. This can cause redness, pain and corneal ulcers. Surgery may be needed in severe cases.  \r\n \t• Hypothyroidism: This endocrine disease occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone resulting in weight gain, hair loss and lethargy. Diagnosis is typically via blood test and treatment is with daily medication.",
  "history_description": "The origin of Weimaraners takes us to early 19th century Germany. The Grand Duke of Weimar (the breed's namesake city) expressed the desire for a dog who was bold, fearless, intelligent and an excellent hunting companion with a strong prey drive. The sportsman had several breeds crossed (possibly Bloodhound with German and French hunting dogs) to create the Weimaraner breed.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Weimaraners were bred for sport and to minimize predator problems. These dogs use their acute senses to detect and point at their prey, leading their human hunting companion in the right direction. In Europe, the hunting dogs were used to flush out wolves, bears and mountain lions that were harming livestock. Big game hunters also prized the breed for their skills.\r\n\r\nThe dog started showing up in America in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized Weimaraners in 1943. Weimeraner fans include President Eisenhower and Grace Kelly.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to add a Weimaraner puppy to your family? A list of reputable breeders is available on the AKC website. What's the price for a Weimaraner puppy? Expect to spend between $500-$3,000 for a puppy who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers. You can also check out Weimaraner rescues or your local animal shelter. You can also search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",
