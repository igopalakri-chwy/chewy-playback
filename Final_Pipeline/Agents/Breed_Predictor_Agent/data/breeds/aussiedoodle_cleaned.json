  "breed_intro": "The Aussiedoodle may sound like a dog from Down Under, but this fun, furry mixed breed is unquestionably tops when it comes to brains, beauty, and athletic ability. \n\nA cross between an Australian Shepherd and a Standard or Miniature Poodle, Aussiedoodles and Mini Aussiedoodles mirror their parent breeds’ love of learning and action. So if you’re looking for a lap dog, keep looking! But if you have an insatiable appetite for exercise and want to add a canine companion on your daily outdoor adventures, the Aussiedoodle just might be your perfect match.",
  "appearance_description": "Mixed breeds are always a bit of a mixed bag, as their appearance ultimately depends on which parent they favor. Two Aussiedoodle puppies from the same litter can look wildly different!",
  "temperament_description": "The Aussiedoodle is a cross of two popular working dog breeds—and they have the temperament to prove it. These are dogs with seriously stellar wits and get-up-and-go energy, making them a top choice for therapy, service, and search-and-rescue roles. \n\nAs family pets, Aussiedoodles will still need a “job” in the form of daily exercise and play, and you couldn’t find a more willing companion. The breed excels at agility, swimming, hiking, dock diving, and running.\n\nBecause of their herding and hunting instincts, all outdoor play should occur on a leash or within a fenced area. Aussiedoodles are also great with kids who are old enough to safely interact with a high-energy pup—they can entertain each other!\n\nWhile Aussiedoodles love their families, they can be more reserved around strangers, especially if they take after their Australian Shepherd parent. (This caution served Aussies well as ranch hands!) Early socialization and training can help Aussiedoodles feel more comfortable with their surroundings, thereby reducing the alarm they might sound at something new.",
  "care_description": "When it comes to caring for Aussiedoodles, there are three main areas to consider: their brain, their body, and their fur.",
  "grooming_description": "Australian Shepherds and Poodles have very different fur, so every Aussiedoodle’s coat is unique. Aussies have double coats that shed regularly year-round. The Poodle’s tight curls, on the other hand, shed very little but require lots of care. \n\nYour grooming routine might look a little different depending on what type of coat your Aussiedoodle inherited, but all dogs need consistent nail, ear, and dental care.\r\n\n\t• Bathing: If your Aussiedoodle loves swimming and outdoor adventuring, they may need more frequent baths. Use a dog-friendly shampoo and dry their ears after they get out of the tub.\nBrushing: Aussiedoodles with curlier coats might benefit from more frequent haircuts and brushing, while those with wavy fur might need less daily attention. Regardless of the type of coat, it’s important to use a brush that can get down to the skin to keep tangles and matting at bay. \nNail trimming: Your Aussiedoodle’s active lifestyle should help wear down their nails, but frequent nail trims will still be necessary. A good rule of thumb is that if you can hear your dog’s nails clicking as they walk across hard surfaces, it’s time for a trim. \nEar cleaning: Water-loving Aussiedoodles with ears that hang down are particularly prone to ear infections. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how to safely clean your pet’s ears and how often it should be done.\nDental care: Dental disease is common in all dogs, especially those with smaller mouths like the Miniature Aussiedoodle. Daily brushing and regular veterinary dental cleanings are key to keeping their teeth and gums healthy.",
  "training_description": "Socializing and training your Aussiedoodle puppy as soon as you bring them home will help the best parts of your Aussiedoodle’s personality shine—and you couldn’t ask for a more willing or capable pupil. \n\nSocialization involves introducing your puppy to new animals, people, environments, activities, and objects with the goal of helping them feel more comfortable in new situations throughout their life. Your veterinarian can suggest age-appropriate socialization ideas, as some activities may require your pup to be fully vaccinated.\n\nLike all dogs, the smarty pants Aussiedoodle thrives with positive training that uses treats and toys to motivate learning. If you feel you don’t have the time or experience to provide training on your own, partner with a professional trainer or enroll your puppy in obedience school. \n\nWhile we often think of training as an activity for puppies, learning is lifelong. Your Aussiedoodle can keep building on their obedience and skills as they grow and mature. As a bonus, learning new cues provides them with vital mental stimulation and exercise.",
  "diet_nutrition": "Even a dog with as much pep in their step as the Aussiedoodle has to refuel every now and then.\n\nPartner with your veterinarian to find the best food for your unique dog. They’ll help you find a diet that meets nutritional standards set by the AAFCO, and that’s formulated and nutritionally complete for your dog’s lifestyle, size, health, and life stage (puppy, adult, senior). \n\nMost full-grown Aussiedoodles should eat two meals a day: once in the morning and again in the evening. Aussiedoodle puppies have faster metabolisms and need to eat more frequently—between three and four times a day. \n\nBreaking up mealtimes can help reduce the risk of a life-threatening condition called bloat that Standard Aussiedoodles are susceptible to. (More on that later.) If you notice that your dog can’t seem to eat their food fast enough, slow their snarfing by using a slow-feeder bowl, snuffle mat, or puzzle toy.\n\nWhile your Aussiedoodle probably won’t agree, it’s possible to give your dog too many treats. Treats should only make up 10% of your dog’s diet to ensure they’re able to eat their regular food, which is formulated to provide the nutrients they need. \n\nIf you notice that treats are beginning to flow too freely during training sessions, you can reward your Aussiedoodle with other things they enjoy, like toys and attention.",
  "exercise_description": "Have you ever heard the saying that a tired dog is a happy dog? In the case of the high-energy, highly athletic Aussiedoodle, it will take some effort on your part to make them happy (but you’ll have a lot of fun in the process).\n\nPlan to spend an hour or more every day being active with your Aussiedoodle. They make excellent walking, jogging, hiking, and swimming companions, and they can thrive in canine sports like agility and lure coursing. These playful pups will also readily engage in games of fetch and other kid-friendly backyard activities. \n\nKeep in mind that even well-trained Aussiedoodles can be overpowered by their instincts to herd and chase. That’s why it’s so important to keep them on a leash or within a fenced area when exercising outdoors. Otherwise, their interests may lead them into danger.",
  "ideal_environment": "Your Aussiedoodle’s exercise needs will be easiest to meet if you have convenient access to the outdoors, whether it’s a large backyard in the country or a sprawling city park. \n\nAussiedoodles aim to please and can befriend family members of all ages. What’s most important is that they have a family who’s committed to their socialization, training, and daily exercise.\n\nAussiedoodles are best suited to older children who can safely hold their own with an energetic dog who may try to herd them. And while Aussiedoodles can live at peace with other pets, there’s no guarantee their furry housemates won’t be seen as herd animals either.",
  "health_description": "Australian Shepherds typically live 12–15 years, while a Poodle’s life expectancy is 10–18 years. You can expect your Aussiedoodle’s lifespan to fall within this range.\n\nLike all breeds, they can develop certain health conditions:\r\n\n\t• Hypothyroidism: Aussies are predisposed to develop autoimmune thyroiditis, a condition in which a dog’s immune system creates inflammation that damages healthy thyroid tissue. It’s the most common cause of hypothyroidism in dogs and can be managed with lifelong medication. \nSebaceous adenitis: Poodles are prone to an inflammatory skin disease called sebaceous adenitis, which causes hair loss, scaling, dandruff, and secondary skin infections. Treatment depends on the severity but can include medications and antibiotic shampoos.\nHip and elbow dysplasia: Elbow and hip dysplasia are conditions where a dog’s joints don’t develop properly, leading to pain and arthritis. Mild cases can be managed with anti-inflammatory medication, joint supplements, and weight management. Severe cases may require surgery.\nBloat: Bloat in dogs occurs when gas and/or food cause the stomach to expand. Sometimes, bloat progresses into a condition called gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), in which the dog’s stomach twists and cuts off blood flow to and from the stomach and the spleen. GDV is painful and a life-threatening emergency, and signs include retching or dry heaving without vomiting, swollen abdomen, sudden anxiety, pacing, panting and drooling, and collapse. If you notice any of these signs, get immediate veterinary care.",
  "history_description": "The history of the Aussiedoodle begins with a tale of two working breeds.\n\nDespite their geographically misleading moniker, Australian Shepherds trace their heritage to Basque herding dogs called Pyrenean Shepherds. These dogs eventually took their sheep-herding skills to Australia and then to California, where ranchers assumed they’d originated from Down Under and dubbed them Australian Shepherds. Since then, Aussies have become common fixtures in Western culture, including cowboy movies and rodeos. \n\nPoodles have a similarly muddled origin story, because while they may be the national dog of France, the breed was developed in Germany. Poodles got their start retrieving ducks from icy waters hundreds of years ago, but their noble demeanor and elegant appearance helped spur the transition from hunting dog to household companion.\n\nAustralian Shepherds became official members of the American Kennel Club (AKC) herding group in 1993, and both Standard and Miniature Poodles joined the AKC’s non-sporting group in 1887.\n\nThe Aussiedoodle is a relatively recent mixed breed—likely originating around the 1990s—and isn’t yet a member of the AKC.",
