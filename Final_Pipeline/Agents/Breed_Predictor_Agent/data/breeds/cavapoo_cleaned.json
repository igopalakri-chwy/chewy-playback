  "breed_intro": "What is a Cavapoo? This mixed breed is a cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and either a Miniature Poodle or Toy Poodle. Put ’em together, and you’ve got a small and affectionate companion for life.\n\nBring home a Cavapoo puppy and you’re guaranteed plenty of snuggles, as these dogs are known for forming deep attachments to their family. When you’re not cozying up on the couch, challenge your Cavapoo with interactive games and training exercises. You’ll be surprised by how bright this little dog can be!\n\nIn exchange for the cuddles, you’ll need to commit to regular at-home brushing and trips to the groomer so your Cavapoo’s curly hair stays free of mats and tangles.",
  "appearance_description": "A Cavapoo bears some physical characteristics of both Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Poodles. There’s also no set breed standard, and the dogs—even Cavapoo puppies from the same litter—can look quite different depending on the genes they inherit from their parents.\n\nBut in general, Cavapoos have a curly coat like a Poodle with large, expressive eyes and floppy ears borrowed from the Spaniel family. Cavapoos descended from a Toy Poodle are typically smaller than those with Miniature Poodle heritage, and the dogs can come in a wide array of colors.",
  "temperament_description": "Cavapoos are known for their gentle and affectionate personality. Erin Askeland, MSc, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, an animal health and behavior consultant at Camp Bow Wow, says this breed is generally friendly and people-focused.\n\nThese companion dogs love to spend time with their human family members in leisure time, play, or a walk outdoors. So don’t be surprised to discover your Cavapoo’s favorite spot to sit is in your lap or right by your side. \n\nSince the Cavapoo temperament is usually quite playful, these dogs make good companions for children—as long as you teach young children how to be gentle with a dog. A Cavapoo’s gentle demeanor and social personality also means these dogs often get along well with other pets—cats included.\n\nThis tight family bond can come with drawbacks, though, and Askeland says Cavapoos can develop separation anxiety if they’re not prepared to handle being alone.\n\nShe encourages Cavapoo pet parents to “work with their dog early on to practice short periods of separation, both by leaving the home and being separate within the home.” It’s also important to meet your pup’s needs before leaving, so make sure your dog has had enough playtime, mental enrichment, food, and potty time before you leave the house.",
  "care_description": "Though Cavapoos are adaptable and happy-go-lucky pups, you still need to make sure you can provide basic care requirements before bringing one home.\n\nCavapoos need daily exercise and playtime, a healthy diet, routine veterinary care, and a commitment to training and socialization. Don’t overlook grooming, either—it’s essential for keeping a Cavapoo healthy.",
  "grooming_description": "• Coat care: Jess Rona, a professional dog groomer in Los Angeles, advises Cavapoo pet parents to plan on monthly visits to a grooming salon for a bath, haircut, and nail trim. Keeping your dog’s long curls trimmed short makes at-home upkeep a lot easier for pet parents.\r\n\n\t• Between grooming appointments, brush your dog at home a few times each week. A slicker brush is a good choice for Cavapoo coats.\r\n\nBathing: Your Cavapoo will likely only need a bath during their grooming appointments—unless they roll in something stinky or dirty.\nDental care: Brush your Cavapoo’s teeth every day with a dog-safe toothpaste. This is the best way to prevent dental disease, which small dogs are highly susceptible to.\nEar care: Cavapoos who have long ears like a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel require diligent ear cleaning, Rona says. These floppy ears can easily become dirty, smelly, and infected. Ask your vet which ear-cleaning product is best for your dog.\nNail care: Trim your dog’s nails if you hear them tip-tapping across the floor when they walk. Your groomer can do this at your monthly appointment, too.",
  "training_description": "Most Cavapoo dogs are eager and intelligent. They’re often a good fit for first-time pet parents because they want to make their family happy. So house training, obedience training, and learning new tricks all come quickly to this pup.\n\nBut like with every dog, consistency is important in your training efforts. Without patience and positive reinforcement, a Cavapoo may struggle to learn. Find what gets your dog excited, like a special treat or toy, and reward them for good behavior.\n\nWhen meeting new people, a Cavapoo is a social butterfly who relishes the opportunity for attention and affection. But even the friendliest dog needs early and consistent socialization to be comfortable in different scenarios, so chat with your vet about how to socialize your puppy. This is just as important as training!",
  "diet_nutrition": "Along with grooming and training, food is a super important part of Cavapoo care. These pups need a high-quality dog food made for their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). Look for food that meets the AAFCO’s nutritional standards.\n\nBut feeding your dog the right food is just one piece of the puzzle; you also need to make sure your Cavapoo is eating the right portions on the right schedule.\n\nUse your Cavapoo’s weight and the feeding guidelines for the dog food you choose to gauge how much you should feed your dog each day, then divide that daily total into meals. Don’t overfeed your dog; obesity can lead to health and mobility problems.\n\nMost adult Cavapoos do well with twice-daily feedings. Cavapoo puppies may need to eat more often to prevent hypoglycemia, so chat with your vet about what’s best.  \n\nAnd don’t forget that treats contribute to your dog’s daily calorie intake! Training treats and dental chews serve a purpose but can be a sneaky source of calories that add up quickly. Treats should not make up more than 10% of your Cavapoo’s daily calorie intake.",
  "exercise_description": "While a Cavapoo enjoys a brisk walk around the block or romp in a fenced backyard, these pups don’t won’t need a marathon to tire them out. “They have moderate energy, so while they require daily exercise and activity, they are also comfortable chilling at home,” says Askeland.\n\nMental stimulation is just as important as exercise, and these smart dogs need the opportunity to problem-solve regularly. Use a puzzle toy or set up dog-friendly games, like a scavenger hunt, to encourage your Cavapoo to use their brain.\n\nOther favorite Cavapoo pastimes include playing fetch, tug-of-war, neighborhood walks, food puzzles, and nose work.",
  "ideal_environment": "If you’re looking for an adaptable and easygoing dog breed, the Cavapoo is a great choice. They’re an excellent match for single people, bustling homes with kids, or an older adult looking for an affectionate companion.\n\nAs small and friendly dogs, Cavapoos do well in small homes and apartments with close-by neighbors they’ll be happy to meet. But be watchful for signs of separation anxiety. Crate training can help, but dogs with severe separation anxiety may need the help of a certified animal behaviorist.\n\nMake sure there’s room in your budget for monthly grooming sessions, too. Or, roll up your sleeves and handle their extensive grooming (which requires bathing, brushing, clipping the coat, and trimming their nails) on your own.",
  "health_description": "The typical Cavapoo lifespan is about 12–15 years. They’re usually healthy dogs, but they can experience a few conditions throughout their life.\r\n\n\t• Allergies: Allergies can affect Cavapoos, which may manifest as excessive itching, licking, or biting at the skin. Recurring ear infections and skin infections are also a sign of allergies. Talk to your vet if you’re concerned your Cavapoo may be allergic to something in their environment.\nHeart problems: Mitral valve disease is a heart condition that affects both Miniature Poodles and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. This inherited condition can lead to poor blood circulation and, in time, congestive heart failure. While there is no cure, it can be effectively managed for many years with medication and regular vet care. \nPatellar luxation: Small dogs like the Cavapoo are at risk of patellar luxation, where the kneecap slips out of place. This can cause a limp and lead to arthritis. Severe patellar luxation might need surgery.\nEye conditions: A Cavapoo’s big dark eyes are cute, but they can develop problems such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), extra eyelashes, entropion, corneal dystrophy, and cataracts. Be alert for changes in your dog’s eyes and talk to your vet if you notice something out of the ordinary.\r\n\nConsider purchasing pet insurance to help with unexpected illnesses or health conditions.",
  "history_description": "While it’s impossible to pinpoint the exact origin of the Cavapoo, these dogs have become increasingly popular with the rise of designer dog breeds that started in the 1990s.\n\nBy crossing a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a Poodle, breeders hope to combine the gentle and affectionate nature of the CKC Spaniel with the Poodle’s intelligence, playfulness, and low-allergen coat.\n\nIn the past few decades, different types of Cavapoo dogs have emerged:\r\n\n\t• An F1 Cavapoo is a puppy bred from a Poodle and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\nAn F1b Cavapoo is a puppy bred from a Cavapoo and a Poodle parent. These dogs have stronger Poodle genes.\nAn F2 Cavapoo is the offspring of two Cavapoos.\r\n\nThe price for a Cavapoo puppy can vary significantly but is often between $1,500–$3,500. Factors like where you live, your chosen breeder, and whether your puppy is an F1, F1b, or F2 Cavapoo all play a part in the cost. You may also get lucky and find Cavapoo rescue dogs by searching your local shelter.",

      "question": "How big do Cavapoos get?",
      "answer": "A full-grown Cavapoo’s size depends on whether they were bred from a Toy Poodle or a Miniature Poodle. Those with a Miniature Poodle parent will be slightly larger, but all Cavapoos typically stand 9–14 inches tall and weigh 8–25 pounds."
