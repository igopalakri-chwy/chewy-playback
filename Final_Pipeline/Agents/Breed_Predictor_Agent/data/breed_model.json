      "breed_intro": "The American Pit Bull Terrier is a canine Hollywood star with a complicated history. Athletic and energetic, they were originally bred for fighting pits in 19th century England and America, but due to their love of people and eagerness to please, became popular family pets and dog actors. They'\u0080\u0099re related to American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers and Bull Terriers'\u0080\u0094all of which are often lumped together under the loose term '\u0080\u009cpit bull,'\u0080\u009d and tend to share an unfair reputation for their fighting past. But to those who truly know and appreciate them, the ABPT is an enthusiastic and loyal companion.",
      "appearance_description": "American Pit Bull Terriers were bred to be muscular and stocky dogs. Their impressive heads are large and shaped like a broad, blunt wedge, while their chests are deep and well-defined. Their short, smooth and low-maintenance coat hugs their bodies and comes in every imaginable color and combination you can think of, other than merle (mottled patches of color).",
      "temperament_description": "Your American Pit Bull Terrier would take a bullet for you but would still be a lousy guard dog. That'\u0080\u0099s because they tend to become BFFs with everyone they meet when they'\u0080\u0099re properly trained and socialized. Contrary to what you may have heard, this friendly'\u0080\u0094even goofy'\u0080\u0094breed brims over with enthusiasm for humans (even strangers), and one of their strongest desires is to please their families.\r\n\r\nWith one of these pups at your side, you should be prepared for lots of sloppy kisses and a constant shadow following you everywhere you go. You couldn'\u0080\u0099t ask for a better family companion, and their well-noted love of children is a definite plus. While untrained Pitties can have a tendency to chase after small animals like cats or squirrels (thanks to their herding history), aggression towards humans is uncharacteristic of the breed, and biting is no more prevalent than among any other type of dog. With the right amount of patience and training, your pet can live peacefully with any four-legged sibling at home, once you make the proper introductions.",
      "care_description": "The athletic, high-energy American Pit Bull Terrier loves to play and needs a lot of mental and physical stimulation. Don'\u0080\u0099t even think about leaving them with a dog toy in your living room and calling it a day unless you want a chewed-up sofa. Boredom is lethal for this breed'\u0080\u0094these pups really want to hang out with you while also working their mind and body. The good news? The time you'\u0080\u0099ll be putting into their daily exercise and training is nicely balanced out by their relatively low-maintenance grooming needs.",
      "grooming_description": "Because American Pit Bull Terrier dogs are low shedders, they require less grooming compared to other breeds with high-maintenance coats. You only need to brush them once a week with a rubber mitt or firm bristle brush to remove any excess or dead hair. Want to make that coat really gleam? Just go over it with a damp cloth afterwards to smooth it out even further.\n\nYou don'\u0080\u0099t want to bathe your dog too often as this can dry out and irritate their skin. Every four to six weeks with a hypoallergenic dog shampoo should suffice. You can also do a spot clean or quick rinse in between if your pet has been playing in dirt or mud. Get step-by-step instructions from a professional groomer on how to bathe your dog.\n\nBrush their teeth daily. Just like other dogs, Pitties can be prone to dental problems like tartar buildup, bad breath and bacterial infections'\u0080\u0094all of which can lead to more serious health issues down the road. So, it'\u0080\u0099s important to keep their teeth healthy. Ask your vet how to get your puppy used to regular tooth brushing from a young age (watch our how to video here) and don'\u0080\u0099t forget to bring them in for a professional cleaning every year.\n\nClip your American Pit Bull Terrier'\u0080\u0099s nails every couple of weeks to prevent cracking or breaking. (Get step-by-step instructions on trimming dog nails here.) You'\u0080\u0099ll know it'\u0080\u0099s time when you hear them clicking across your hardwood floor or their paws get caught up in the carpet. Try to schedule this during their down time, after they'\u0080\u0099ve been out for a long walk or feel relaxed after a satisfying meal. It will be easier on both of you as your pet is less likely to squirm in your arms.\n\nWhen grooming, check their ears for signs of infection, like foul smells or discharge, rashes, redness or swelling. If you do notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your vet right away.",
      "training_description": "Between their irresistible zest for life and their ability to make instant buddies wherever they go, a well-trained American Pit Bull Terrier dog is a joy to behold. The trick is to start socialization and obedience training when your pup is young (starting at 8 weeks old), so they have time to get into a comfortable routine and bond with you. An uber-intelligent American Pit Bull Terrier puppy lives to please, so lots of love is the key to their heart, along with rewards, treats and positive reinforcement techniques. While they respect confident pet parents who set and enforce boundaries, you should never act aggressively as it may teach your dog to only respond to aggression in the future.\n\nLike many dogs, American Pit Bull Terriers benefit from a consistent and positive training program. From getting your pup used to a variety of people and situations to going on doggy dates, early socialization should be your top priority. Training your dog to keep focused on you even in the presence of unfamiliar pets will allow you to hold as much control in the dog park as in your living room. Keeping them on a leash while outdoors may be necessary to help them play nice with other dogs they'\u0080\u0099re meeting for the first time (and depending on where you are, it may be the law to keep dogs leashed). Watch our tutorial on how to leash train your dog.\n\nBecause of their smarts and lovable nature, this breed is a lot of fun to train and also does well in advanced dog sports, like agility, obedience and weight pulling. As they show off their brawn and brains, your pup will make you proud to be their pet parent!",
      "diet_nutrition": "American Pit Bull Terriers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to choose a food that meets nutritional standards set by the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) and to factor in their age and stage in life (puppy, adult, senior) when choosing the right formula for them. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific diet.\n\nWhen rewarding your American Pit Bull Terrier for good behavior, look for training treats, which are usually small in size. Remember, treats count toward their total calorie intake for the day and should make up no more than 10% of their overall diet.",
      "exercise_description": "To keep American Pit Bull Terriers happy and healthy, you should exercise their bodies as well as their minds. Doing activities together is essential as leaving these dogs to their own devices could mean trouble, along with an unexpected crater or two in the backyard. So schedule at least one to two hours of intense activities every day and forget about penciling that in. For this commitment, you'\u0080\u0099ll have to use permanent marker because the couch is simply not an option for these high-energy pups.\r\n\r\nRunning or jogging together, playing tug-of-war games, Frisbee or flyball, and agility obstacle courses are all great ways to meet these dog'\u0080\u0099s high exercise needs and let them vent out their energy. When out for a walk, Pitties love to sniff and explore everything in sight. Allow it happily, as this easily excitable breed finds the game of scent especially relaxing (whatever works!). Don'\u0080\u0099t forget to alternate those leisurely walks with lots of training tricks, dog puzzles and mental challenges to keep this brainy dog both focused and entertained.\r\n\r\nAs with any games you might play with dogs, make sure to regulate your pup'\u0080\u0099s excitement and intensity so it doesn'\u0080\u0099t escalate into unwanted behaviors like nipping or growling.",
      "ideal_environment": "Strutting their stuff for their pet parents is central to the American Pit Bull Terrier'\u0080\u0099s personality. Whether they'\u0080\u0099re jumping in the air to catch a Frisbee or leisurely sniffing the daisies along their morning route, they just want to be by your side.\r\n\r\nThese loyal companions have a lot of energy and need to be taken out for intense activities every day without fail, so they do best in spacious environments where they can expend their energy and with pet parents who will make time for them. Slackers need not apply. The American Pit Bull Terrier breed can be excellent family members and loving with kids and other pets as well. The one caveat: As with any dog, they must be socialized properly and consistently and supervised to ensure their playtime doesn'\u0080\u0099t get too rough. Because they are so chummy with strangers, you don'\u0080\u0099t have to worry about hosting dinner parties. They will enjoy nothing more than adding friends to their ever-expanding roster!",
      "health_description": "The American Pit Bull Terrier has a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years and can be susceptible to a range of health issues. It is important to be aware of potential health problems, so you can help your pup live the healthiest life possible.\r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: This inherited disease is common in bully breeds. It causes their hip joints to form improperly and can lead to arthritis. If your pup has difficulty getting up or develops lameness in their hind legs, take them to the vet to get X-rays of their joints and have their arthritis managed with medication. In severe cases, surgery can be an option.\r\n \tKnee Problems: The cranial cruciate ligament (or CCL), which is one of the most important stabilizers inside the knee (in humans called the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL), can rupture over time. When the CCL becomes damaged or torn in a dog, surgery is typically required to repair it.\r\n \tSkin Infections: A lack of zinc or an inability to absorb it could make your American Pit Bull Terrier prone to zinc-responsive dermatosis, a type of skin infection. To treat the symptoms, which can include lesions on the nose and foot pads or red, oozing skin around the face, vets can prescribe a regimen of zinc to add to your dog'\u0080\u0099s diet. Allergies can also cause skin issues. More on that below.\r\n \tAllergies: Bully breeds are very susceptible to a variety of allergic triggers and have chronic skin issues as a result. Allergies can be triggered by diet ingredients or environmental factors including pollens, grasses, flea activity, and dust mites inside the home. Affected dogs may develop symptoms that include itching, skin rashes, redness of the skin and hair loss.\r\n \tBlindness: Bully breeds are slightly more likely to develop cataracts as they age. Cataracts are cloudy areas that develop in the lens of the eye, causing affected dogs to have a progressive loss of vision. Symptoms may include a white, hazy appearance to the lenses, poor vision in low light, and clumsiness or disorientation in unfamiliar spaces. This condition can be treated with surgery to remove the cataracts.",
      "history_description": "The American Pit Bull Terrier is one of several breeds who can trace their origin all the way back to the now-extinct Old English Bulldog and Old English Terriers. Such dogs were crossbred to fight each other in the dog fighting pits of England.\n\nIn the late 19th century, European immigrants brought some of these dogs to the U.S. Here they found work on farms and ranches, catching hogs, hunting, driving livestock, and acting as family companions. As they gained in popularity, so did the desire for them to be officially recognized as a breed. In 1898, the U.S.-based United Kennel Club recognized the American Pit Bull Terrier, with the first dog to be registered belonging to the club'\u0080\u0099s founder. Then in 1909, the breed was recognized by the American Dog Breeders Association.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the UK, dogs crossbred for pit fighting split off into two different breeds: Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\nNotably, the APBT is not recognized by the American Kennel Club. In an attempt to separate the breed from their negative past as a fighter, the AKC decided instead to acknowledge a subset of the population, eventually settling on the name American Staffordshire Terrier. The first group were entered in the AKC registry in 1936, after the AKC was assured by breeders that they would not allow their dogs to be used for dogfighting.\n\nAll of these types of dogs fall under the umbrella term of '\u0080\u009cpitbull.'\u0080\u009d\n\nAre you looking to add an American Pit Bull Terrier to your home as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the United Kennel Club website. The average American Pit Bull Terrier cost is anywhere from $1,300 to $2,500 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to American Pit Bull Terrier rescue organization to adopt or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. Learn more about adopting a dog.",

These small dogs think they're big dogs, which is why it'\u0080\u0099s important for French Bulldog puppies to receive training and socialization early on. That will help them feel comfortable and friendly toward visitors (human or animal) who come to their home. Otherwise, they may be standoffish with strangers.\n\nBut make no mistake'\u0080\u0094French Bulldogs are friendly dogs who bond deeply with their people and love to have a good time. Because of those deep bonds, they can feel neglected and anxious when their people are out of the house for too long. If you'\u0080\u0099ve ever experienced missing someone even before they'\u0080\u0099re gone, then you can relate to how Frenchies feel.\n\nSpeaking of their people, the French Bulldog breed is good with kids and babies, but as with any dog, they should always be supervised and taught how to interact with dogs. They also get along with other dogs and cats, as long as you introduce them properly.\n\nThe French Bulldog is primarily a companion dog. You'\u0080\u0099re unlikely to see them helping first responders, but their unconditional affection makes them amazing emotional support and therapy dogs in hospitals and care homes.

And don'\u0080\u0099t forget their annual professional dental cleaning by your veterinarian.\n\nWeekly:\n\nYou'\u0080\u0099ll likely only need to brush your French Bulldog once a week with a grooming glove or simple bristle brush. Yes they shed, but they don'\u0080\u0099t shed as much compared to other breeds like Boston Terriers or Pugs. Brushing will help reduce the amount of loose hair you find around the house.\n\nMORE: A Complete Guide to Brushing a Dog the Right Way, According to a Pro Groomer\n\nAnother weekly task to stay on top of is checking their ears for debris and any redness or swelling. If you notice anything, speak to your vet. They may recommend at-home cleaning.\n\nOccasionally:\n\nUnless they get exceptionally dirty, Frenchies only need a bath about once every 1-3 months. (Get the how-to here.) Overbathing removes the natural oils from their coat and skin. Between baths, you can keep them clean with a damp washcloth or cleaning wipes.\n\nTrim their nails as needed.

Collaborate with your veterinarian to find the right combination of quality food and regular exercise. Keep an eye on the scale and adjust amounts as needed.

Opt for a game of fetch in the yard or a nice walk around the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBe sure to keep an eye on their breathing while they exercise. As a brachycephalic (flat-faced) dog breed, Frenchies are prone to airway issues (more on Brachycephalic syndrome in the Dog Health section below). And don'\u0080\u0099t forget your pup'\u0080\u0099s mental stimulation; dog puzzles, scent work and simply getting out and exploring the world will help enrich their mind.",

As long as they have your company and a time and a place for exercising, they'\u0080\u0099ll thrive.\n\nTwo things they cannot handle well: extreme hot or cold. Frenchies prefer a moderate climate. During hot spells, bring them outside during the cooler parts of the day and consider buying a few products to help them keep cool and prevent heatstroke. In the winter, limit outside time and consider keeping your pup warm in a cute dog coat or dog sweater.\n\nWith all their needs and personality quirks, does that mean you have to be an experienced dog owner to have a Frenchie? Not necessarily. French Bulldogs are a good choice for first-time pet parents, if you can commit to their training'\u0080\u0094the earlier, the better. With proper training and socialization, they'\u0080\u0099ll be happy to adjust to your lifestyle and social schedule.\n\nJust don'\u0080\u0099t leave them alone for hours at a time.

If you see signs of infection (irritated, red, or swollen skin), visit your vet.\r\n \tBrachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS): One well-known Frenchie trait is their '\u0080\u009csnorting/snuffling/snoring'\u0080\u009d sounds; some pet parents even consider them endearing. While these noises may seem harmless, the fact is their physical attributes cause them health problems. Brachycephalic breeds (flat-faced dogs) may develop difficulty breathing during exercise because of the smooshed anatomy of their nostrils, airways and soft palettes. You can manage symptoms by keeping your dog at a healthy weight, but severe cases might require surgery.\r\n \tEar Infections: French Bulldogs are somewhat prone to ear infections (their ear canals are narrow). If your dog suffers from frequent ear infections, your veterinarian can show you how to properly and safely clean the ears to help prevent future infections.\r\n \tSpine and Orthopedic Issues: Your French Bulldog may also be susceptible to common issues like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), hip dysplasia and patellar luxation. IVDD is a disease of the spinal cord. Depending on the severity, pain meds or surgery can be used to treat the condition. Hip dysplasia is when the hip joint doesn'\u0080\u0099t fit properly. Treatment can range from weight management to physical therapy to surgery. Patellar luxation is a knee issue where the kneecap slips out. Keeping your pup at a healthy weight is your first line of defense; severe cases might require surgery.\r\n \tEye Problems: The French Bulldog dog breed is susceptible to common eye issues, including cataracts and cherry eye. Cataracts, a cloudy lens, can cause blindness, but surgery can often correct it. Cherry eye is a condition when the third eyelid slips out of place and swells, which is also typically treated with surgery.",
      "history_description": "Here'\u0080\u0099s a surprise: The French Bulldog actually originated in England. They were developed as a smaller type of Bulldog (aka English Bulldog) and were popular with people in the lace-making industry in the 1800s. Gaining notoriety for their temperament in Nottingham, a center for lace-making, they became a bit of a lace-maker mascot. After the Industrial Revolution changed the lace-making industry, many lace-makers moved to France, where their diminutive bulldogs became fashionable. French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec even included the French Bulldog in his art.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1800s, Americans began taking notice of the charming bat-eared dogs, and established the French Bull Dog Club of America in 1897. There was a bit of controversy regarding bat ears versus '\u0080\u009crose ears,'\u0080\u009d which start upright, then fall to the side and back (the ear interior looks like a rose). American French Bulldog enthusiasts favored the bat ears, and as in France, the French Bulldog became fashionable in the United States, especially among socialites.\r\n\r\nFollowing World War II, their popularity decreased, but experienced a steady rise until the 1960s and eventually surging in the 1990s. The breed catapulted (dog-apulted?) to the No. 2 spot on the American Kennel Club'\u0080\u0099s list of Most Popular Dog Breeds in 2020.\r\n\r\nConsidering a French Bulldog as a pet? Find a list of reputable French Bulldog breeders on the American Kennel Club'\u0080\u0099s website. Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000-plus for a pup. Be sure the breeder you buy from screens their dogs for health and temperament issues.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to French Bulldog rescues (find an organization via Chewy'\u0080\u0099s Shelter and Rescue Network) or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, though know that you don'\u0080\u0099t often see the breed in multi-breed shelters, as most reputable French Bulldog breeders will take the dogs they sell back from families who no longer desire their pet. If you'\u0080\u0099re open to adopting a 3-4-year-old dog, reach out to local breeders and ask about their retired female dogs. Breeders often spay their females after two litters and then find them loving permanent homes.",

They can also have a variety of patterns and colors in their coats, ranging from black to chocolate, red, blue or gold, with tan or cream markings. Every Dachshund dog has an adorably courageous demeanor, always ready to defend the honor of their loved ones.",
      "temperament_description": "Dachshunds may look playful and cute, but their little hearts carry the bravery of a strong soldier. They're loyal to a fault to their human family, but they don't always get along so well with other dogs or cats.\r\n\r\nBecause of their fragile backs and protective personalities, they do better in homes without young kids and babies. A child who plays too roughly could seriously injure your Doxie, so early socialization, training and supervision with small kids and babies are important.\r\n\r\nThese small-sized but confident pups love to bark, so while they can be just fine in a small or large home, they might not be the best choice for apartment living. And if you have a yard, be warned: Dachshunds were bred to keep badgers off property, so they'll chase any small animals in your yard and may dig a few holes to search for critters underground.\r\n\r\nDachshunds are smart problem solvers who might figure out a way to get at your uneaten food if you leave it out too long. While they aren't couch potatoes, they also aren't hyperactive; they'll enjoy a moderate walk with you every day.\r\n\r\nIn the right home, these sausage dogs are a joy. Be ready for quite a few laughs when you have a playful Dachshund. They might even steal the socks right off your feet from time to time.",
      "care_description": "Dachshunds are playful and adorable, but they must be handled with care due to their fragile spines. They don't need to be bathed often, but their bellies may need more frequent brushing because their bodies are so close to the ground and can pick up stickers or burrs. Because they may be quicker to bite than some other dog breeds, it's important to not only introduce Dachshunds slowly to anyone new but also provide early socialization, training and supervision with small kids and babies. These family dogs are happiest with scent-focused games to play and loving humans to relax with in a quiet home.",
      "grooming_description": "A Dachshund's brushing needs vary depending on which type of coat they have:\n\n \tA short-haired Dachshund can be brushed when needed, but you'll want to wipe their fur regularly with a hound glove.\n \tLong-haired and wire-haired varieties are more likely to get mats or tangles, so they should be brushed at least once a week, but a few times a week is ideal. A slicker brush will help get the tangles out, then use a bristle brush to keep the coat shiny.\n\nBecause Dachshunds' bodies are low to the ground, they may need extra brushing if they've been outside to remove burrs or stickers.\n\nThankfully, shedding isn't a big issue with Doxies. You won't have a hair-free home, but they shed much less than longer-haired breeds, like Huskies.\n\nAs for bathing, you only need to bathe your Dachshund once every few months, although longer-haired varieties may need a bath once a month. Of course, if your pup is outside and rolls in something stinky, you might want to make an exception!\n\nThe Dachshund breed is more likely to develop tartar than other breeds, so, it's important you brush their teeth every day. Start brushing their teeth while they're puppies to get them used to the experience. If you're not sure how to brush their teeth, your veterinarian can teach you. Also, remember to get their teeth professionally cleaned by your vet once a year.\n\nDachshunds need their nails trimmed about once a month; you'll know it's time when you hear them tapping on your hardwood floors. This may be difficult for some pet parents to do, but your groomer or vet can help.",
      "training_description": "Dachshunds thrive with positive reinforcement training. This method uses special treats, toys and lots of praise to motivate the pup. Because they can sometimes be stubborn, it's best to keep the training sessions short. Use treats they absolutely love to help keep them excited about learning. If they lose patience and get distracted by a sound or smell, just let them wander away and continue their training later.\n\nDoxies also have a powerful nose, so they respond well to any scent-based game. Play hide-and-go-seek with treats to grab their attention and give them much-needed mental stimulation.\n\nIt's a good idea to start socializing your Doxie as a puppy. Early socialization helps them get used to having other people and dogs around, and group obedience classes are a good place to start. Doxies do well with older children, but young children will need to be supervised when your dog is in the room. And while they do OK with other dogs in the home, they often prefer to be your one-and-only pup.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Dachshunds typically do well with a high-quality, commercial dog food. Make sure the food you choose meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials. (Look for the AAFCO statement on the package.) Factor in your dog's age and use a nutrition formula designed for their stage in life, whether they're a puppy, adult or senior dog. Your veterinarian can help you nail down a feeding chart to guide you on how much and how often to feed your dog.\n\nYou'll also want to consider their activity level when choosing how much to feed them each day. It's important that your Dachshund doesn't become overweight since they are short with long backs. Also, the extra pounds can exacerbate any back problems. (Dachshunds are prone to spinal issues.) Be sure to keep track of the treats you give them (snack calories count, too!), so you don't accidentally overfeed them.\n\nBut again, consult with your veterinarian, as they are in the best position to help you pick the best food and diet for your dog based on their individual needs.",
      "exercise_description": "Dachshunds have moderate energy levels, so their exercise needs aren't as intense as some other breeds. They do, however, need activities that avoid putting stress on their fragile backs. Walking your dog every day (about 30 minutes) at an easy-going speed, along with daily play and training, is really all your pup needs. Avoid intense exercises that includes jumping or rough play since this can exacerbate their back issues and possibly aggravate any cases of intervertebral disk disease.\r\n\r\nDachshunds were bred as hunting dogs for badgers, so they'll love participating in sports like Earthdog, where they hunt rodents in tunnels. (The rodents are kept safe from the dogs during the sport.) If they're left alone in a yard, they'll gravitate toward this instinct by hunting any small-sized animal they see and digging lots of holes, so it's best if you can give them a healthy outlet for their digging instincts instead.",
      "ideal_environment": "Dachshunds thrive in quieter homes where they have quality time with their humans and soak up all of their love and attention. They also thrive with pet parents who can provide regular walks. They need a moderate amount of exercise without any rough play, because they can suffer back issues. For households with young children, teach them how to properly interact with dogs (again, no rough play!) and supervise them when they're together. With proper socialization and introductions, Dachshunds can learn to get along with other pets, too.\r\n\r\nAlthough experienced pup parents might do best with Dachshunds, a first-time pup parent will be just fine as long as they do their research first. These loving dogs can be equally happy in a small or large home, as long as they have daily walks and lots of time with you.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dachshunds are smart, confident and loyal. If they think something is amiss, they'll let you know. And even though they love outings that challenge them mentally and physically, they also love to snuggle up with you at the end of each day.",
      "health_description": "Dachshunds have a lifespan of 12-16 years, but the breed does have a few health issues you'\u0080\u0099ll want to watch for. To reduce the odds  of health problems, work with a Dachshund breeder who screens for these issues and ask to see the test results of the litter and parents you'\u0080\u0099re considering.\r\n\r\n \tBack Issues: Dachshunds are prone to back problems that can lead to paralysis if not treated promptly. This includes intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), caused by a bulging or slipped disc. As many as 25 percent of Dachshunds may have IVDD at some point. If you notice any change in your dog'\u0080\u0099s movement or trouble walking, talk to your veterinarian right away. Depending on the severity, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory may be all that'\u0080\u0099s needed. There are several steps you can take to help safeguard your Dachshund'\u0080\u0099s back: Avoid any rough play or jumping; always carry your dog by supporting their hind end with one hand and chest with the other; keep them a lean, healthy weight; and set up ramps or stairs, so they don'\u0080\u0099t have to jump on the furniture.\r\n \tBloat: Dachshunds can develop gastric torsion or bloat, where the stomach twists on itself. Symptoms can include being in pain, pacing, drooling, trying to throw up but not being able to or licking their lips. This can come on fast, and it is life-threatening, so you'\u0080\u0099ll need to get your dog to a veterinarian quickly if you notice symptoms.\r\n \tDeafness: If your Dachshund'\u0080\u0099s parents are both dapples (the coat is mottled with patches of color), your pup has a greater chance of being deaf. While there is no cure, deaf pups can live a very happy life.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: This occurs when a kneecap slips out of its normal position. You may notice this issue if your dog does a little skip sometimes when walking. Some dogs may not need any treatment, while others may need surgery, depending on the severity. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can help prevent this issue.\r\n \tEpilepsy: Dachshunds can also have epilepsy, which is typically a genetic issue. Medications may be needed for more severe cases. Breeders will screen for this issue to prevent passing the condition on to future generations of Doxies.\r\n \tEye Problems: Dachshunds can have eye problems, including cataracts, glaucoma or progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). All three can cause blindness. Cataracts and glaucoma may be treated with surgery. PRA is not treatable; however, most dogs adjust to life with vision loss. Your veterinarian can watch for these issues, and breeders may be able to screen for them.",
      "history_description": "Dachshunds' origin dates back more than 600 years ago to Germany where they were bred to hunt badgers. In fact, their name is German for \"badger dog.\" Their narrow, low-to-the-ground body is perfect for digging into badger tunnels, and their confident, brave personalities make them mighty hunters. They were also bred to have a loud bark to alert their humans whenever they found badgers underground. Sometimes, packs of Dachshunds were used for hunting wild boar.\r\n\r\nDoxies were bred for three different types of coats depending on their climate. Their original coat was short and smooth. Some were bred to have longer coats for colder climates, and others were bred to have wiry coats to help them avoid thorns when they worked in regions with brier patches.\r\n\r\nDachshunds were first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. But during World War I, they were used in German propaganda. As a result, the AKC temporarily rebranded them as Badger Dogs or Liberty Pups in the United States. Today, they're widely beloved dogs. There are numerous clubs dedicated to them, including the Dachshund Club of America.\r\n\r\nWhere is the best place to find a Dachshund puppy today? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. The average Dachshund price can be anywhere from $200 to more than $3,500 for a Dachshund puppy, depending on the breeder, pedigree papers and health screenings. Dachshund rescue organizations and local shelters can also help you find a purebred to adopt. You can also search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

They'll benefit from regular brushing during this time, which may mean you'll need to brush them a couple of times a week, or it may need to become part of your daily routine, depending on how much your Beagle sheds.\r\n\r\nThey usually only need a bath after a good romp in the mud or after following their nose into something messy. Dogs' toenails grow at different rates, but generally speaking, most dogs need their nails clipped every one to two months. A good rule of thumb is if your dog's nails touch the floor when they're standing, it's time for a trim.\r\n\r\nWhile many pet parents might associate long, floppy ears with ear infections and think they need extra cleaning, experts now believe ear infections are more related to allergies than the ear's anatomy. A monthly cleaning should do the trick to keep those ears clean, but to avoid over-cleaning, always make sure there is actually dirt in your Beagle's ears. (You should be able to see dirt specks when you lift their ears.) From there, add a few drops of dog ear cleaning solution, massage with a tissue or cotton ball'\u0080\u0094no cotton swabs allowed'\u0080\u0094then let your dog shake their head to dislodge anything that might be in there.\r\n\r\nBecause dental disease is an issue with the Beagle breed, it's recommended to brush your dog's teeth anywhere from two times a day to three times a week to stop plaque and tartar from building up. It may seem silly to brush a dog's teeth, but periodontal disease is serious business. It can lead to a loss of teeth and even more serious issues like heart, liver, and kidney disease. In addition to regular brushings at home, be sure to take your dog to the vet for professional dental cleanings.",
      "training_description": "As they've transitioned from being solely hunting dogs to members of a household, Beagles have earned a reputation for being difficult to train. While they can be distracted by every smell within a five-mile radius, this gentle breed shouldn't be trained with a heavy hand. They respond very well to positive reinforcement training and are treat-motivated. Encourage them to listen by making training fun, and before you know it, training sessions will be the highlight of their day'\u0080\u0094and yours, too!\r\n\r\nEven the best-trained Beagle may not be able to overcome their instinct to follow their nose, so training them to come when called is essential. Loose-leash walking is another skill that may take some time to master since they want to follow everything they smell in every direction (a typical Beagle trait). But teaching your dog when it's time to sniff and when it's time to walk can be very helpful. For example, training them to \"leave it\" and \"let's go\" when it's time to walk and \"okay\" or \"go sniff\" when they're allowed to sniff around.\r\n\r\nAs we've mentioned before, Beagles can be talkative. They're also very intelligent and can sometimes train their humans better than we can train them! To avoid inadvertently reinforcing their barking tendencies, ignore your Beagle when they are trying to get your attention by talking. Reward them with treats or attention when they quiet down. Even telling them \"no\" can be seen as giving them attention, so resist the urge.\r\n\r\nIt's always a good idea to take your dog to a basic training class or seek a certified trainer's help if you need a professional perspective.",
      "diet_nutrition": "The best food for a Beagle is a complete-and-balanced formula that is age-appropriate. To determine whether a food is, in fact, complete and balanced, look on the package for a statement that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). You'll still want to talk to your veterinarian, who can help you determine the best dog food for your dog's unique needs, based on things like weight, activity level and age.\r\n\r\nBeagles come in two sizes, so their ideal weight varies from under 20 pounds for dogs up to 13 inches tall and 20 to 30 pounds for dogs 13 to 15 inches tall. The breed is very food-motivated and has a lot of energy, so if they are overfed and under-exercised, your Beagle may get too heavy. Beagles are already on the shorter and stockier side, but a dog at a healthy weight should have a defined waist and straight sides. If you look at them from above and you see a round potato, your dog is probably overweight. You should also be able to feel their ribs.\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about your Beagle being overweight, your veterinarian is your best resource. But you can also cut down on treats (or switch to something with fewer calories, such as frozen green beans) and slowly increase their exercise by taking a slightly longer walk each day until you build up to about an hour a day. These could be two shorter walks or one long walk. The good news is that exercise for your Beagle means exercise for you, too!",
      "exercise_description": "Beagles have a high energy level and need regular exercise'\u0080\u0094about an hour or so every day'\u0080\u0094 or they may release their pent-up energy in way you don't approve of. Since they are driven by scent, nosework'\u0080\u0094where you train a dog to find a certain odor'\u0080\u0094can be a great option to help expend their energy. You can sign up for nosework classes, but this is easy to do at home, too. All you need to do is grab two to three boxes, put a treat under one of them and let your Beagle sniff it out. Always use the same box as the \"treat box\" and gradually make it more difficult by adding boxes, stacking them, hiding them around the house, etc.\r\n\r\nAgility classes are another great option that can help burn off that Beagle energy, but again, it's totally something you can set up in your backyard if you have the space. Just don't let your Beagle off-leash outside of the fenced yard because their instinct to follow a scent is so strong that you could end up with a runaway dog.\r\n\r\nIf you can't get outside for the day due to weather or limited time, try a game that exercises their mind. Play hide-and-seek, give them a puzzle toy, or practice those training skills!",
      "ideal_environment": "The ideal environment for a Beagle is with an active family who can give them plenty of exercise and extracurricular activities. Because of their higher exercise needs and tendency to bark and howl loudly, the breed may not make the best apartment dwellers. They're also not a dog you can put in the backyard and hope they entertain themselves'\u0080\u0094this intelligent breed needs interaction. Otherwise, they might bark excessively while running the fence line and chasing every squirrel. Not ideal for them, you or your neighbors!",
      "health_description": "Several health problems are commonly seen in Beagles. While you won'\u0080\u0099t necessarily come across these in your dog, it'\u0080\u0099s good to know what to keep an eye out for'\u0080\u0094from eye issues to joint concerns'\u0080\u0094so your Beagle can live their life as happy and healthy as possible.\r\n\r\n \tCherry Eye: Cherry eye is the common term for prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid. It'\u0080\u0099s usually due to a weakness of the connective tissue that normally holds the gland in place, and appears as a pink or red bulge in the front corner of the eye. It is not usually painful but can be irritating for the dog, and often requires surgery to fix. It is not preventable and can happen to dogs at any age, but it most often occurs in dogs younger than 2 years old.\r\n \tIntervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): IVDD is a neurological condition that occurs when one or more of the discs found between the vertebrae of the spine slip or rupture, causing the disc material to press on the dog'\u0080\u0099s spinal cord. It can be very painful, and your dog may be suddenly paralyzed or not able to use their back legs. Weight control is one important way to prevent this from happening.\r\n \tDental Disease: Beagles tend to experience more dental disease than other dogs their size. It'\u0080\u0099s recommended to start dental care when they are puppies, as periodontal disease can lead to teeth loss and even more serious issues like heart, liver and kidney disease.\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition that occurs as a dog grows, causing the hip joints to develop improperly. The result is instability or looseness of the hip joint, and eventually leads to cartilage wear and degenerative arthritis over time. Arthritis can further lead to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, as well as pain. This condition is typically diagnosed with x-rays. Treatments range from the nonsurgical, like weight reduction and physical therapy, to surgical, depending on the severity. Because hip dysplasia has a genetic predisposition, affected dogs should not be bred.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: Luxating patella (kneecap) is a condition that occurs when the groove that holds the patella in position is too shallow, allowing the patella to escape its normal position when the knee joint bends and straightens. This condition is seen more commonly in smaller breeds and does not always cause discomfort. but it can lead to other painful problems, like torn cruciate ligaments, arthritis and more.\r\n \tEpilepsy: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects the brain and results in recurrent seizures. Epilepsy is diagnosed when all other causes of seizures have been investigated and ruled out. Epilepsy ranges in severity, with some dogs experiencing seizures very rarely and others as often as daily. Depending on the severity, medications are available to control the seizure activity.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs and is caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or atrophy. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through blood testing, so thyroid levels should be a normal part of screening bloodwork as Beagles age. This condition can be managed with medications.",
      "history_description": "While the breed's exact origins aren't exactly clear, reports of small hounds hunting hares in Britain date back as far as 55 B.C. As time went on, larger hounds were bred for tracking down deer, and smaller hounds were bred for rabbit hunting. Modern Beagles are most likely descendants of smaller hunting hounds from the 1500s. Around that time, Beagles became popular as '\u0080\u009cfoot hounds,\" meaning that'\u0080\u0094unlike with larger hound breeds'\u0080\u0094one could hunt with a pack of Beagles on foot instead of on horseback.\r\n\r\nBeagles arrived in the United States after the Civil War, and '\u0080\u009cBlunder\" was the first Beagle recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. The breed has always been popular among rabbit hunters and is one of the most popular dog breeds among families today, ranking as the seventh-most-popular dog by the AKC.\r\n\r\nLooking to make a Beagle part of your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC's website. Working with a reputable breeder usually means you're getting a puppy who's been screened for health issues and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Beagle price can range from $350 to $1,500, with an average of about $500 to $850. Propsective pet parents can also adopt from Beagle rescue groups, keep an eye out for the breed at their local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area. .",

      "temperament_description": "Australian Shepherds embody what they were bred to do: herd. They are fast, smart and always on the move. As such, providing training and outlets for all their energy are a must.\n\nBecause they have a natural herding instinct, Aussies may try to round up unsuspecting children or neighbors on a bike ride. For this reason, it'\u0080\u0099s crucial to train your Aussie early so they understand how to behave and what'\u0080\u0099s expected of them. Be sure your pup is well-trained before they go off-leash, too, because Aussies are known for their speed.\n\nCultivate their natural curiosity by implementing daily training sessions that engage their mind and their bodies. They want to please you, and daily training sessions will deepen your bond.\n\nPlaytime is another way to engage Aussies'\u0080\u0094and blow off some of that energy! Just about any game you invent will be enthusiastically enjoyed by your pup. Most Aussies adore fetching and can have impressive skills; they have a well-deserved reputation as disc dog champions. Throw a Frisbee for your pet at the park and onlookers are sure to be amazed at what your Aussie can do.\n\nWhile your Aussie'\u0080\u0099s exuberant personality might make you think they are incredibly social, they tend to be cautious around strangers. Proper socialization when your Australian Shepherd is a puppy will help them feel comfortable in new environments with unknown people.\n\nBottom line: Aussies dislike downtime (except when they'\u0080\u0099re sleeping!), so keep them engaged with lots of outside time and toys, such as interactive chew toys, flying discs and balls.",

      "grooming_description": "Do Australian Shepherds shed? Yes! As double-coated dogs (meaning they have longer guard hairs on top of a softer undercoat), it'\u0080\u0099s important to use brushing tools that can reach the undercoat. To help reduce shedding, use a slicker brush in the direction of the fur, followed gently by an undercoat rake. A thorough, weekly brushing will help distribute the natural oils and keep their coat glossy from nose to tail.\n\nHere are a few more tips for grooming your Australian Shepherd:\n\n \tBathing: Australian Shepherds are blessed with a coat that'\u0080\u0099s equipped to handle many weather conditions. Bathing them too often can strip the natural oils that keep their skin healthy. Aussies only need a bath about once every 6-8 weeks unless they are especially dirty from one of their outdoor adventures. Pro tip: Leave a dog towel by the door to rub them down when they come inside the house after a romp outside, and pay special attention to their paws, which can get roughed up from off-road adventuring. Have a dog paw cleaner handy, too.\n \tDental care: Brush your dog'\u0080\u0099s teeth every day to keep them healthy and to prevent dental disease. Start brushing your dog'\u0080\u0099s teeth as a puppy so they'\u0080\u0099re used to the feeling. Once a year, take them to the vet for a professional cleaning.\n \tNail trimming: Because the Aussie is an active dog, their nails may not need trimming as frequently as a more sedentary dog.

      "health_description": "The Australian Shepherd breed has a lifespan of about 12-15 years and is generally hearty. Presently, the breed has a long life expectancy'\u0080\u0094it'\u0080\u0099s not unusual for an Aussie to live to 16 years old. However, there are a few health issues to be aware of: \r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a painful genetic condition in which the ball of the femur doesn'\u0080\u0099t properly fit into the hip socket. Environmental factors, such as obesity, can exacerbate symptoms, which means a healthy diet and regular exercise routine are crucial for Aussies. Vets can manage hip dysplasia in Aussies with physical therapy and medication; in some cases, they may need to do surgery. \r\n \tEye Problems: Cataracts are the most common eye disease in Aussies. Aussies are also at risk of other eye defects, including Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA), a hereditary disease of the nerve and eye tissue that ultimately leads to blindness. Although surgery can treat cataracts, it won'\u0080\u0099t help with CEA. Aussies are also susceptible to distichiasis, a condition in which an eyelash grows abnormally, potentially scratching the eye. Depending on the severity, treatments range from an eye lubricant to surgery. Finally, iris coloboma is a condition seen in Aussies where the iris (colored part of the eye) does not develop properly and can lead to light sensitivity and discomfort. If you notice anything unusual about your Aussie'\u0080\u0099s eyes, bring it to your vet'\u0080\u0099s attention. \r\n \tCancerous Tumors: Aussies have an increased risk of some cancers, particularly lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma (cancer from the cells that line blood vessels). Let your vet know if you notice any unusual growths, but remember some growths can be internal. Some growths are noncancerous (benign), but others are cancerous. Treatment options can include surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Usually, the quicker the diagnosis, the more treatment options. \r\n \tEpilepsy: Epilepsy or seizures can be an inherited condition in Aussies. There are no genetic screening tests for epilepsy, but often the condition can be well controlled with daily, lifelong medication. If you have any concerns that your pet may be having a seizures, please see your vet immediately.   \r\n \tMultidrug Resistance Mutation (MDR1): MDR1 is a genetic mutation commonly found in herding breeds including Aussies. This mutation makes dogs more sensitive to some medications, particularly Ivermectin, which is found in many heartworm prevention medications. There is genetic testing, which can detect if your dog has this mutation. While most commercially available heartworm prevention medications are still safe for dogs with MDR1 mutation when used as prescribed, it is always important to consult your veterinarian on the right medication for your pet.  \r\n\r\nLike with any pet, take your dog in for regular check-ups so you and your vet understand your Aussie'\u0080\u0099s healthy \"normal.\" This can help you better identify when your Aussie behaves atypically. Small changes, such as lethargy, lack of interest in food or water or urinating or pooping more or less frequently, may be a sign of a larger issue, so get changes checked right away.",
      "history_description": "A misconception about the Australian Shepherd'\u0080\u0099s origin is that they hail from Australia. Believe it or not, the Aussie'\u0080\u0099s story begins not in Australia but in the Basque region of Spain, near the Pyrenees mountains that border Spain and France. Here, herdsmen selectively bred the ancestors of the beloved Aussie for their herding abilities.\r\n\r\nAs people from the Basque region settled in Australia during the 19th century, they brought these working dogs with them. Over time, these dogs were bred with other herding dogs, like Border Collies, and found homes on Australian ranches.\r\n\r\nAs migration progressed from Australia to the American West, Australian Shepherds found footing in California, where the locals mistakenly assumed Australia was the dogs'\u0080\u0099 place of origin. California ranchers admired these dogs for their work ethic and exceptional herding abilities. As a result, they became valued for their abilities in the rodeo adding \"rodeo performer\" to their resum\u00c3\u00a9.\r\n\r\nThe AKC added Australian Shepherds to the Herding group in 1993. Today, they are still regularly found on ranches and farms worldwide. Not only are they great additions to high-energy families, but Aussies can also be found working as service or therapy dogs and in jobs like search and rescue.\r\n\r\nIt'\u0080\u0099s commonly thought there are two types of Aussies: the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Australian Shepherd. During the 1960s in California, breeders developed the Miniature Australian Shepherd by breeding to create a smaller body size while retaining the intelligence and activity level of the Aussie. But the dogs they used were unregistered, so their exact lineage isn'\u0080\u0099t clear. Today these diminutive dogs are known as the Miniature American Shepherd and entered the AKC Stud Book in 2015.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add an Australian Shepherd to your family? An Australian Shepherd can cost anywhere from $600-$2,000-plus for a purebred puppy. Be sure to do your homework on how to acquire a healthy puppy: Ask to see the parents and be sure that a breeders'\u0080\u0099 stock has health clearances for hips, elbows and eyes.\r\n\r\nIf you'\u0080\u0099d like to adopt, reach out to Australian Shepherd organizations, such as Aussie Rescue and Placement Helpline (ARPH), a nationwide network of Australian Shepherd rescues, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area. With any rescue, you want to know what you are adopting: Look for a health status and temperament evaluation. As with all dogs, it'\u0080\u0099s essential to factor in veterinarian care, training, food and pet sitting into your budget, as well as the initial cost.",

          "question": "Are Australian Shepherds hypoallergenic?",
          "answer": "No, Australian Shepherds are not hypoallergenic. Australian Shepherds are heavy shedders, so with all that fur and dander, people with allergies may need to love this breed from a distance."

          "question": "Are Australian Shepherds smart?",
          "answer": "Yes, Australian Shepherds are incredibly smart. One of the primary Australian Shepherd traits is their intelligence.

          "question": "Are Australian Shepherds good with kids?",
          "answer": "Australian Shepherds are good with kids, especially older ones. Aussies look for things to herd and will lean into their herding instincts when small kids and babies are around. In an active family with older kids who have time and energy to play, Aussies can thrive, but training and patience are required to help an Aussie accept that kids and babies don'\u0080\u0099t need corralling."

        {
          "question": "Do Australian Shepherds have tails?",
          "answer": "Australian Shepherds have tails, and there'\u0080\u0099s a one-in-five chance that an Aussie will have a naturally bobbed tail since they were bred that way for effective herding. If an Aussie is born with a long tail, the breeder will often dock it to protect it from injury and maintain the look of the breed.\r\n\r\nThe AKC breed standard allows for their tail to be docked straight, docked or naturally bobbed. Docking involves cutting a portion of the dog'\u0080\u0099s tail off when they are puppies. Many countries and states have banned it for medical and behavioral reasons, and some veterinary groups oppose it."

          "answer": "While both breeds have herding instincts, their styles differ. Border Collies are intense, work-focused herders, while Australian Shepherds are more adaptable and family-oriented. Border Collies are highly driven and obedient, excelling in tasks like agility. Aussies also excel in competitive dog sports, but their silliness tends to make them better family pets."

Be ready to work hard and play harder (and explore the world outside your block) with this indomitable pal.",
      "appearance_description": "With their poised, moderately pointy ears, and piercing dark eyes, the German Shepherd dog breed has an aura of authority and nobility. They're not all business, however. These dogs have bushy and slightly curved tails that wag back and forth when they're out adventuring with their family or being rewarded for a job well done. Well-bred German Shepherds have straight backs and muscular frames that are longer than they are tall.",
      "temperament_description": "The German Shepherd's best trait is their intense, unwavering loyalty to their families. (There's a reason they make some of the best police dogs.) The fearless breed has also been known to put themselves in harm's way before they let a family member get hurt.\n\nSocialization and training are essential for German Shepherds, to teach them that most things in this world are nothing to fear (and nothing that poses a threat to their loved ones, either). Early social interactions with kids, babies and other animals is also important if you want your German Shepherd to be well-behaved around guests. (Remember to teach children how to interact appropriately with dogs, too.) With the proper education, this easy-to-train pup can be a great family dog.\n\nGerman Shepherds are born talkers. They will bark when they're bored, and they'll bark to alert you if something isn't quite right. But training and exercise can help curb a lippy pup and keep their barking to when you need it the most.\n\nThese dogs are incredibly smart, and they are at their best when they have a job to do, whether working as a police or military dog, doing tracking or search and rescue, serving as a guide dog or at home practicing scent work or solving puzzles for a treat. And when they're with their family, German Shepherds will let their silly side show as they flip their toys in the air and roll around on their backs.",
      "care_description": "A German Shepherd puppy can become one of the best companions a pet parent could ask for, but they don't come work-free. German Shepherds need regular grooming, plenty of exercise and a lot of training. However, these pups are quick studies, and all your efforts will be rewarded.",
      "grooming_description": "A German Shepherd's grooming needs are rigorous compared to other dog breeds. Their dense double coat protects them from sun exposure and keeps them warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Brush your pup every day with a pin brush to keep the coat shiny, clean and healthy, especially in the spring and fall when they shed the most. (Warning: They shed a lot.) Bathing too frequently can strip their coat of its natural oils, so plan on bathing your German Shepherd every three to four months, or when they get really dirty.\n\nDuring their daily grooming sessions, brush your German Shepherd's teeth with a canine toothbrush and toothpaste to prevent tartar buildup, and have your vet professionally clean their teeth once a year. German Shepherd's ears do not need to be cleaned regularly, but while you're brushing out their coat, be on the lookout for signs of infection such as redness and ear odor. (If you do see signs of infection, call your vet, who may recommend at-home ear cleaning.)\n\nAbout once a month, your pup's nails will need a trim if they are not ground down naturally through all that exercise. You'll know it's time when you hear them clacking on hard surfaces. Get the how-to here.",
      "training_description": "Proper training is very important for your German Shepherd, and training should always include positive reinforcement (using treats, toys and lots of praise). Because they are a large-sized pup and often wary of strangers, an untrained dog can be unruly. And their training should start early. Socialize your puppy with other animals and people and introduce them to new experiences and objects. Puppy school is a great way to get them used to other people and dogs and start their obedience training all in one place. (Obedience training usually includes skills like sit, stay, come and how to walk nicely on a leash.)\n\nBred to herd cattle, Shepherds are often nippers as puppies, and you may have to navigate the teething phase for about six months. It may be cute when they're little, but German Shepherds have a strong bite force and jaw strength, so it's important to teach your puppy not to bite while they're young.\n\nWhen you're home, work their sniffing skills with puzzle toys and sniffing walks (where you just meander and let your dog discover the world through their nose). Participating in canine sports like agility, tracking and herding are great ways to train your pup, get some exercise in and strengthen your bond. Remember, the best German Shepherd is a busy German Shepherd, and enriching their environment by giving them something to think about and do will have tremendous benefits.",
      "diet_nutrition": "A German Shepherd's food and diet should include a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). You should talk to your veterinarian about a feeding chart that will let you know how much and how often to feed your dog based on their specific needs.\r\n\r\nGerman Shepherd dogs often get upset tummies, and their skin is notoriously sensitive. Pick a dog food with highly digestible proteins and nutrients that support skin health. Small amounts of cooked vegetables and eggs can also be beneficial to German Shepherds, but again, consult with your veterinarian to ensure your pup gets the nutrition they need.\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget about treats! Treats are an integral part of dog training, but you don't want to forget them when counting up your pup's daily calorie needs. (Just like with you, snack calories count!)",
      "exercise_description": "German Shepherds have a very high energy level, and you need to use up all that energy to keep your pup well-mannered. Plan on spending about two to three hours every day focused on physical and mental activity. This could include scent walks, where your dog is allowed to stop and sniff whatever engages them; brisk jogs through the neighborhood; or a game of fetch in your backyard. Pro tip: Keep your pup on a leash when you're not in a fenced yard until you're absolutely confident they won't run away. German Shepherds are known for their speed; they can run up to 30 miles an hour. You don't want your pup catching an interesting scent and jetting off!\n\nDo you like to swim? Some German Shepherd dogs enjoy a dip in a pool or lake, which can be a good way to play when it's hot out. And don't forget the dog park. They can have fun frolicking at the dog park as long as they've been well socialized with other people and pets. (Check your park's requirements for large dog breeds.) Outdoor adventures, like hiking, are also a fun way to get off the beaten path and give your pup new scents to discover.\n\nDon't forget to engage their brains! Mentally stimulating activities can be just as tiring as physical ones. You don't always have to feed your pup out of a bowl or give them a treat for shaking hands. Hide treats under boxes, so your pup has to push the boxes around to get the treat, or feed them in a creative way like stashing kibble in different spots throughout the house or using interactive feeding toys. These are great ways to get a German Shepherd to engage their nose and stimulate their mind.",
      "ideal_environment": "The most important factor in raising a German Shepherd to be happy and healthy is a pet parent with the time and patience to train and play with them. Life in the country, suburbs or any place where there's plenty of space to roam and play is ideal.\r\n\r\nAs long as they get out and about for frequent exercise and do mentally stimulating activities in the home, they can be fine in apartments. (And if your neighbors are OK with all the barking.) City dwellers, take note: All the noises and different dogs they're likely to encounter every day can cause this highly vigilant breed stress. To keep stress to a minimum, take your dog out during less busy times of the day and plan routes that are less hectic.\r\n\r\nDespite their tough exterior, German Shepherds have a soft center. They can get very lonely if left by themselves for long periods. So, if you have to be gone for a while, check them into doggy daycare or schedule a pet sitter to come by and play with your pup.\r\n\r\nA German Shepherd can be great as a pet with kids and babies when the pup is well-socialized and trained and the kids are taught how to interact with dogs. German Shepherds can become a child's best friend.",
      "health_description": "German Shepherds have a life expectancy of 7 to 10 years, but are prone to a number of health problems. It'\u0080\u0099s important for a pup parent to be aware of the common health conditions that can affect your dog, so you can help them live the longest life possible.\n\n \tElbow and Hip Dysplasia: German Shepherd health issues include these degenerative joint diseases that can cause pain throughout their life. With either elbow or hip dysplasia, the joint doesn'\u0080\u0099t fit properly. According to the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals, about 20 percent of German Shepherds have hip dysplasia. Look for signs like limping and decreased range of motion. Treatment can include weight loss, reduced activity, joint supplements, pain medications or, in severe cases, surgery.\n \tDegenerative Myelopathy: A neurological disorder that affects the spinal cord, this disease can lead to paralysis of the hind legs. Early signs of degenerative myelopathy include weakness in the hind legs and difficulty standing up. There is currently no treatment for it, but physical therapy can help preserve the muscles and prolong the use of their legs.\n \tCancer: German Shepherds can develop certain types of cancers, including hemangiosarcoma (malignant tumors that often develop in blood-rich areas like the heart or spleen), bone cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer. Signs of cancer can include lethargy and loss of appetite. Depending on the severity, treatment options can include chemotherapy, radiation or surgery.\n \tBloat or Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): This is a life-threatening emergency where the stomach swells and twists, and it is more common in dogs with deep chests like German Shepherds. If your dog is retching/dry heaving (trying to vomit but no vomit is coming out) or their abdomen looks distended, take them to the vet immediately.\n \tAllergies: German Shepherd dogs are prone to both seasonal allergies and food allergies. These typically present as scratching, itching and skin rash. If you suspect your pet may have allergies, please make an appointment with your veterinarian.\n \tDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): This is a genetic heart condition where the heart enlarges, making the heart muscle weak and thin which potentially results in heart failure. Diagnosis is typically based on echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and treatment is most often daily medication.\n \tExocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI): In this condition, the pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to digest food. Symptoms include weight loss despite a ravenous appetite and soft stool. While there is no cure, treatment with pancreatic enzyme supplements can be highly effective.\n \tPannus: Also known as superficial keratitis, this immune-mediated disease leads to abnormal tissue in the eye. It is painful and can lead to blindness. If you suspect your pet is having any issues with their eyes, your vet may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist.\n \tEpilepsy: German Shepherd dogs are prone to seizures and epilepsy which typically occurs at 6 months to 5 years of age. Treatment is often daily medication.",
      "history_description": "The smart, agile German Shepherd breed we know today was largely the creation of one man. In the late 1800s, Captain Max von Stephanitz set out to create the perfect German herding dog (capable of keeping sheep in line and protecting them from predators like wolves) and cross-bred different dogs from northern and central Germany. He spent decades promoting the breed and even created the first club devoted to German Shepherd dogs. When herding became less of a necessity in the 1900s, their history took a turn when von Stephanitz decided German Shepherds would make the ultimate K-9 or police dog.\r\n\r\nThe German Shepherd became the 60th breed to be recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1908, and the German Shepherd Dog Club of America was founded in 1913. American families fell head over heels for German Shepherds while watching \"The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin\" in movies and on television. (The original Rin-Tin-Tin was born in 1918.) However, during the world wars, their popularity wobbled due to anti-German feelings. But this pup, with their wonderful personalities, was not down for long. Today, the German Shepherd is among most popular dog breeds in America.\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find German Shepherd puppies? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What is the price for a purebred German Shepherd puppy? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. But for that, you'll likely get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to German Shepherd rescue organizations to adopt one or keep an eye out at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

Either way, your Yorkshire Terrier will be the definition of super-cute.",
      "temperament_description": "Though small and cute with flowing locks, the Yorkshire Terrier is a smart, spunky dog who isn't aware of their diminutive stature. Originally bred to hunt rodents before becoming popular as lapdogs, the Yorkie retains much of that tough terrier 'tude (and bark) today. These confident pups might just take full command of the household if you let them, not-so-gently letting you know when it's time to wake up, put the food out and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this smart breed is eager to please, making them a quick study when it comes to dog training. With early training and plenty of opportunities for social interactions with humans and canines from a young age, Yorkies can be a loyal, playful and friendly best bud. However, they aren't great with young kids and babies'\u0080\u0094or, rather, young children aren't great with them, especially those who like to play rough and haven't been taught how to respect a dog's boundaries. As with any dog, be sure to supervise encounters to ensure a safe and positive playtime.\r\n\r\nYorkshire Terriers don't mind being handled and carried, so they're some of the most portable pups around. But be careful not to coddle them too much. Yorkshire Terriers still need exercise and independence so that they don't grow afraid to be out of your arms. In fact, because Yorkies bond so closely with their people, many Yorkie parents get two so they can keep each other company.",

After you shampoo your Yorkie, apply a conditioner'\u0080\u0094yes, this breed needs to be pampered'\u0080\u0094and then rinse. Many Yorkie parents spritz their dogs with a leave-in conditioner afterwards, too.\n\nAs you bond over a grooming session with your Yorkshire Terrier, check for signs of inflammation or infection (sores, redness, flaking, bumps, etc.) on their skin, paws and ears. Give those ears a good sniff, too; a foul odor can be a sign of infection. Call your vet if you notice any of these signs.\n\nBe sure to keep their nails trimmed. You may need to trim them every two to four weeks'\u0080\u0094you'll know it's time when you hear them clicking as they walk across hard surfaces.\n\nAnd don't forget to brush their teeth daily to help keep their teeth and gums healthy and reduce the risk of dental disease down the road.

This breed is eager to please'\u0080\u0094Yorkies love soaking up accolades'\u0080\u0094so take advantage of this trait and throw in a party trick or two like twirling on their hind legs (why not?) along with the basic safety commands including sit, stay and come. In fact, Yorkshire Terriers excel at agility and obedience competitions. So if you're an aspiring Yorkshire Terrier Best in Show'\u0080\u0093type pet parent, start them young and get out that puppy training 101 manual!\n\nAn important part of training your Yorkie will be socializing them with other dogs and humans from an early age. It's tempting to pick these little cuties up and carry them everywhere instead of letting them interact with the world, but this can make them anxious'\u0080\u0094and anxious dogs are harder to train. Talk to your vet about when it's safe to take your Yorkshire Terrier puppy out on walks, and maybe even start puppy school, so they can learn some obedience at an early age and how to socialize around other dogs.\n\nYorkshire Terriers tend to be highly vocal so it's also worth investing time in working with them to curb excessive barking. You don't want that off-the-charts cuteness to be overshadowed by their noise levels.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Yorkshire Terriers typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Make sure the food you choose meets the nutritional standards of the Association of American Feed Control Officials. (Look for the AAFCO statement on the package.) When selecting a food, factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior).\r\n\r\nSince Yorkies are small in size, they don't need nearly as much food each day as, say, a Mastiff. But they do have very fast metabolisms, which might leave them feeling hungrier faster. Talk to your vet about possibly serving your Yorkie puppy three or four smaller meals per day instead of the classic morning and evening feedings. Your vet is in the best position to help you nail down a diet and feeding plan for your individual dog.\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire Terrier also loves a heavy dose of appreciation, especially in treat form. But while training treats are great for training, you don't want to overdo it. Remember that those little morsels of praise amount to calories, and even an extra pound can make a big impact on your dog's overall health. Treats should only constitute a small percentage (10 percent) of your pet'\u0080\u0099s daily food.",
      "exercise_description": "Yorkshire Terriers don't need a ton of exercise needs to meet their energy level'\u0080\u0094unlike, say, Golden Retrievers'\u0080\u0094but they do need frequent and regular opportunities for movement and play, as much for their minds as for their bodies. Without exercise, this smart breed can get bored. Even a dog of this tiny size can make a mess of your neatly placed cushions... and possibly even just as guests arrive at the door. Two 15-minute daily walks is sufficient, but also keep puzzle toys at home to keep your Yorkie engaged and moving during the day. A living-room game of fetch or gentle tug-of-war is great, too. They also love the challenge of dog sports, like agility or conformation (dog shows), so feel free to get creative with how you exercise your little pooch.\r\n\r\nWhen you do go out and about together, remember not to speed walk'\u0080\u0094your Yorkshire Terrier's little legs can't keep up! Instead, be patient, and try to avoid resorting to picking up your pup, which deprives them of the exercise they need.",
      "ideal_environment": "You don't need a ton of space or even a yard to make a Yorkie happy. Of course they need to run and play, like any dog, but they can have a ball playing tug-of-war right in your apartment living room. As loving companions, they'll also appreciate a comfy couch and a welcoming lap, and you can use these up-close-and-personal moments to give your pooch a lengthy grooming sesh, which is so important for this breed.\r\n\r\nYorkies can tolerate other dogs and cats if they are raised together, and they can do well with children as long as both dog and child are taught how to behave around each other. Work long hours outside the home? A Yorkshire Terrier may not be the best fit for you, unless you can bring your Yorkie with you. This breed bonds closely with their human and likes to be by their side (or better yet, on their lap).\r\n\r\nYorkshire Terriers don't love extreme heat or cold, but who does, really? As long as you've got a good dog sweater in the winter and carry plenty of water in the summer, your Yorkie should be fine during your short walks.",
      "health_description": "Your Yorkshire Terrier will likely lead a perfectly healthy life with a generous lifespan of 11 to 15 years, but all dog breeds are at risk for certain health issues. Being aware of them may help you recognize any concerns'\u0080\u0094and get treatment'\u0080\u0094sooner.\r\n\r\n \tCollapsed Trachea: The Yorkie dog breed is prone to collapsed trachea, which is defined as a flattening or weakening of the trachea (windpipe) and can make it difficult for your dogs to breathe. Treat their neck carefully using a harness or a properly fitting collar (be sure two fingers fit snuggly between the collar and your dog'\u0080\u0099s neck) to protect the trachea. Depending on the severity, treatment for a collapsed trachea may include lifestyle changes, cough suppressants, anti-inflammatories and, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tHypoglycemia: Yorkie and other toy breed puppies are at the highest risk before the age of 5 months for hypoglycemia. This condition causes a sudden drop in blood sugar which appears as drowsiness/lethargy, vomiting, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, tremors and seizures. Call your vet ASAP if you notice any of these symptoms; depending on the severity, supplemental glucose, IV fluids and even a hospital stay might be needed.\r\n \tPeriodontal Disease: The Yorkshire Terrier'\u0080\u0099s short nose, small mouth, crowded teeth and genetics predispose them to dental disease. Their teeth are often overcrowded, leaving plenty of nooks and crannies for plaque and bacterial growth, which can lead to dental and gum disease. Familiarizing your Yorkie with dental care at a young age is best. Make sure to brush your Yorkie'\u0080\u0099s teeth every day, check their gums regularly for swelling/redness and note any plaque on the teeth or even bad breath.\r\n \tLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease: A rare and likely genetic disease of the hip joint and connecting femur bone, Legg-Calve-Perthes usually develops in the first year, causing pain and limping. Serious cases may require surgery, and most Yorkies make a full recovery after treatment.\r\n \tLuxating Patella: This common issue in toy breeds occurs when the dog'\u0080\u0099s kneecap pops out of place, resulting in a limp. Your vet can screen for this issue with a standard patella evaluation. If patellar luxation occurs in your Yorkie, talk to your vet about whether surgery is needed to correct the problem.\r\n \tProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): The Yorkshire Terrier breed is also genetically at risk for abnormal development of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. PRA can be seen in puppies (less common) or in adult dogs with a slow progression of the disease. Most dogs will be born with normal retinal tissue, and then slowly they will lose sight, very often first observed with difficultly seeing at night and leading to blindness. Management of the disease focuses on preventing injuries that come with vision decline, e.g. more lighting for your dog'\u0080\u0099s space (inside and outside), maintaining a regular furniture configuration in the home, using safety gates to prevent stair use and working on leash training. Yorkies with low to no vision can thrive, leading very normal happy lives.",
      "history_description": "Like the name suggests, the Yorkshire Terrier is a terrier who has their origin in'\u0080\u0094you guessed it'\u0080\u0094Yorkshire, England, in the mid-1800s. These dogs are likely descendants of the Scottish Terriers, brought to the area by Scots who came looking for jobs. Like most terriers, Yorkies were bred to hunt and kill small vermin. In their case, Yorkies were probably put to work in mines ratting out, well, rats. By the late 1800s, this working-class, soot-snouted little dog captured the attention of the posh Victorian ladies of the day, who cleaned them up and made them proper lapdogs.\r\n\r\nThe pups made their way to the US, and the American Kennel Club recognized the Yorkshire Terrier breed in 1885. During World War II, Smoky, a Yorkie found by an American solider in New Guinea, accompanied US troops on their missions in the South Pacific and was credited with 12 combat missions and awarded eight battle stars.\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire Terrier Club of America was founded in 1951. Today, they remain a popular family pet.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to get a Yorkie as a pet? You can find responsible breeders at the AKC's website. A Yorkshire Terrier puppy can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000. For this price, you're typically getting a dog who's been screened for health and temperamental concerns and may even come with papers.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to a Yorkshire Terrier rescue organization to adopt a Yorkie, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.\r\n\r\nPro tip: If you're looking for a Yorkie with white in their fur, you may be looking for a Biewer Terrier, a close cousin to the Yorkshire Terrier. Also, some unscrupulous breeders may advertise \"teacup\" or \"tiny toy\" or \"extreme tiny\" Yorkies, which are dangerously bred to weigh less than three or four pounds. Yorkies are already a Toy breed, and these other names are simply a marketing ploy.",

The Boxer's tail is often docked and their ears cropped, although more pet parents are leaving Boxer ears in their natural, floppy state, which certainly seems to suit their playful personality.",
      "temperament_description": "With their muscular physique and dark eyes, Boxers might seem tough and serious. But don't be fooled! The ability to make many two- and four-legged friends is one of the Boxer's greatest strengths. Silly pups at heart, they're like a kid in a dog's body, which may explain why Boxers and kids get along so well. They'll never cease to put a smile on your face with their clown-like antics. You can often catch them sitting with their rear legs out in front of them (like people) and rolling back into a lazy dog position. They're also prone to zoomies and stopping on a dime to dole out sloppy, wet kisses. If your dream dog is athletic and affectionate, the Boxer's for you.\r\n\r\nOften described as being more human than dog, Boxers are known to be quite sensitive. They'll work 24/7 to please their loved ones, but this desire to please means they can get their feelings hurt. (Sad puppy dog eyes warning!) Originally bred to serve as guard dogs, Boxers perform brilliantly as service, assistance and therapy dogs, and in roles such as drug detection and search-and-rescue. However, some Boxers may not get along well with dogs they don't know and of the same sex.",
      "care_description": "Exuberant, playful and sensitive, Boxers require a good deal of exercise and training. But the extra effort is worth it thanks to their good nature and charming personalities.",
      "grooming_description": "Brush their coat: The Boxer dog breed's short hair and shiny coat, which sheds most in spring, requires very little grooming. Brushing your Boxer a few times a week using a rubber curry brush or a hound glove can help keep shedding in check and keep the coat healthy and tight to the skin.\n \tClean their teeth: Speaking of brushing, brush their teeth daily to prevent tartar buildup and dental disease.\n \tBathing and nail trimming: Unless they get really dirty, Boxers only need to be bathed once a month. Turn it into a doggy spa day and trim your Boxer's nails at the same time (unless they get naturally worn down on hard surfaces).",
      "training_description": "Training is a great way to provide physical activity and mental stimulation, which are especially important for Boxers. Originally bred as a guard dog and wild game chaser, they're energetic, smart and prone to jumping and leaping, especially when they're young. Boxer puppies may nip when they play, which may be cute when they're puppies, but they have a powerful bite force as adults, and their play biting will not be so cute. So, a Boxer puppy will benefit greatly from early socialization and dog training classes. (You'll for sure want to teach them the \"down\" command.)\n\nThe good news is Boxer dogs are highly trainable due to their intelligence and excellent problem-solving skills. A training regimen with plenty of fun and positive reinforcement works best, as they can become bored with repetition (and remember, they can get sad if they feel they've let you down).\n\nCanine sports such as obedience, agility and herding are all great options for burning off that Boxer energy. Interactive toys, puzzle games and scent work (which teaches a dog to identify and track various odors) also can keep Boxers mentally stimulated throughout their life.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Boxers do well on high-quality, complete and balanced commercial diets. To determine if a dog food is complete and balanced, look on the package for a statement that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).\r\n\r\nBreed-specific diets, like Royal Canin Boxer dog food, can help satisfy a Boxer's unique needs by providing, for example, the optimal amount of protein to maintain muscle mass and nutrients that contribute to good heart health. (Boxers are prone to heart issues. More on that below.)\r\n\r\nWhatever diet you choose, it should be appropriate to your dog's age (puppy, adult or senior) because Boxers have different nutritional needs at different life stages. As puppies, they'll benefit from diets that support their growth and immune system, like Royal Canin Boxer dry puppy food. At around 6 or 7 years old, they may need to transition to a senior diet to help manage their weight, which can become an issue later in life. Be sure to speak to your veterinarian, as they can help you choose the best food for your dog based on their activity level, weight, age and unique needs.\r\n\r\nTreats can be an effective training aid but giving too many can cause obesity. Treats shouldn't make up more than 10 percent of a dog's diet. And of course, your Boxer should always have access to clean, fresh water.",
      "exercise_description": "Boxers are smart, active dogs who need exercise every day, whether it's a few walks and runs to release energy or several hours a day in a secure, fenced-in area. Well-trained Boxers make great running companions for short, brisk runs when the weather is moderate. Because Boxers are speedy (they're one of the fastest dog breeds and can reach speeds of over 30 miles per hour), experts recommend pet parents keep them on a leash. Boxers also love to play fetch. Growing Boxer puppies should be exercised less than adults. You don't want to cause injury or damage development.",
      "ideal_environment": "Boxers need room to roam, so apartments may not be ideal. A house with a big yard for activity and exercise would be best, but living in an area where long walks are possible will also suffice. Also, Boxers don't like extreme temperatures. They should be kept inside the house as a cherished member of the family, where they'll likely claim a section of the couch or bed if you allow it.\r\n\r\nOverall, Boxers do well in family households, but because they are playful and high-energy, they're not a great choice for a frail adult or a home where very small children might be frightened by a well-intentioned but jumpy puppy.",
      "health_description": "Boxers have a life expectancy of 10-12 years, but they'\u0080\u0099re also prone to some health issues that can limit their lifespan and mobility. It'\u0080\u0099s good to know what those potential health problems are in advance, so you can keep them healthier longer. \r\n\r\n \tHeart Defects: Some Boxers are born with congenital heart defects. Later in life, they can develop a genetic heart muscle disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or ARVC. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is also common in Boxers and can lead to heart failure. This condition causes the heart to enlarge and the walls of the heart to thin, leading to inefficient pumping of blood. Regular vet checkups and Holter monitoring (a portable device that monitors heart activity) from middle age onwards can prolong a Boxer'\u0080\u0099s life. \r\n \tUlcers: Eye ulcers are a common condition in Boxers. Signs are extreme tearing, squinting and redness. If you suspect your Boxer has an eye ulcer, take them to a vet who can diagnose and treat it. \r\n \tDegenerative Myelopathy: This incurable degenerative neurological condition spreads through the spinal cord and can leave a dog unable to walk when they get older. Subtle dragging of the hind legs is often the first sign dog parents notice. A doggy wheelchair can help improve mobility and quality of life. \r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Boxers have a predisposition to this skeletal condition in one or both hip joints. If your Boxer has trouble getting up from sitting or navigating stairs, it can be an indication of the disease. A veterinarian can diagnose hip dysplasia with an examination and X-ray. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include physical therapy or surgery. \r\n \tAortic Stenosis: This health condition, which refers to a narrowing at the heart'\u0080\u0099s aortic valve, is hereditary and occurs in large-breed dogs. It is often detected as a heart murmur during a routine physical exam but is diagnosed through an X-ray and echocardiogram. In mild cases, the dog may not need treatment. In moderate to severe instances, medication may be needed. Most often, exercise is limited in Boxers with this condition. \r\n \tCancer: Unfortunately, Boxers are prone to several different cancers, including hemangiosarcoma and lymphosarcoma, as well as other tumors. Having a good vet who is in tune with your dog'\u0080\u0099s health history is essential. \r\n \tDental Issues: Sometimes, Boxer teeth do not come in when expected, which can cause painful cysts to form that damage the dog'\u0080\u0099s jawbone. Boxer underbite, when the upper jaw is shorter than it should be, can be common. If the upper incisors dig into the lower jaw, teeth will have to be extracted. \r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland is no longer producing enough thyroid hormone. This can lead to changes that may include (but are not limited to) lethargy, weight gain, skin changes, reproductive problems and neurological problems. Hypothyroidism is typically managed with a daily thyroid medication that replaces the missing hormone. \r\n \tGastric Dilitation-Volvulus (GDV): GDV is a problem that is most prevalent in large, deep-chested dogs. When GDV occurs, the stomach fills with food or gas and then twists, cutting off the blood supply to the stomach and adjacent structures. This condition can be rapidly fatal and requires immediate emergency treatment. Prevention may include feeding smaller more frequent meals (often from a slow-feeder bowl) and limiting exercise before and after feeding times. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend performing a surgical procedure called a gastropexy, which can secure the stomach to the chest wall and limit its ability to rotate.",
      "history_description": "The sleek Boxer we know today can be traced back to Medieval Germany. It was bred down from the larger German breed, the Bullenbeisser, or bull biter, whose forte was hunting ferocious game like bear and wild boar. Fun fact: The Boxer's ancient ancestors were Assyrian empire war dogs and can be traced back to 2,500 BC. The name \"Boxer\" comes from the breed's English fans and is a nod to how the breed plays or defends themselves with their front paws, similar to how a human boxer spars.\r\n\r\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Boxer in 1904, and the breed's parent club, the American Boxer Club, was formed in 1935. A jack-of-all-trades, Boxers have been athletes, cattle dogs, police dogs, war dogs (in both World Wars), watchdogs, protection dogs and guide dogs for the blind. Boxers have been one of America's most popular breeds since the 1950s. That's when a dog named Bang Away won at the Westminster dog show and became known throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in making a Boxer part of your family, the cost ranges from $800 to $2,000 for a purebred Boxer puppy. It's important to check the bloodline and choose a reputable breeder that does health testing.

But you'll always be their No. 1.",
      "appearance_description": "Shih Tzus' faces are often compared to chrysanthemum flowers because their facial hair fans out like petals in every direction, including in front of their eyes if you let it. Their most distinctive feature is their luxurious, floor-sweeping coat, which comes in a variety of color combinations, often with black, tan or white markings, including a spot on their foreheads known as the Star of Buddha. Their innocent round eyes, trusting demeanor and small, compact stature give them the appearance of a cuddly plush animal, which along with their gentle nature has earned them their prized toy dog status over many centuries.",
      "temperament_description": "Small in size but big on personality, the Shih Tzu is adored by everyone they meet. An agile and adaptable pet, your pint-sized pooch will love cuddling with you on the couch in front of the TV, but they're equally happy trotting by your side in the park.\r\n\r\nA fun-loving breed, Shih Tzus enjoy playing with older children, who understand how to play gently with a small dog, and other four-legged pets as long as proper introductions have been made (they are descended from royalty after all). They aren't known for biting, but like any dog, they may bite if pushed too far in rough play. Be sure to teach all children how to gently interact with dogs, and to supervise your Shih Tzu puppy around young children who may mistake this adorable pup for their favorite stuffy.\r\n\r\nWith their ability to assess situations much faster than other small breeds, the Shih Tzu is so much more than a pretty face. They make excellent watchdogs; they are always on alert for someone approaching your home and will let you know they're coming. Even though they may exhibit a stubborn streak and require extra patience when training, they are worth the effort. Their loyalty and calm manner in all types of situations serve them in good stead as emotional support animals when their small size is not an issue.",
      "care_description": "Regular grooming is essential for showing off your Shih Tzu dog's luxurious long hair and keeping it out of their eyes. You may find yourself needing extra doses of love and care during training. But good news! It all balances out, as these low-shedding pups require less daily exercise than other dogs and can be just as happy playing hide-and-seek in your living room as chasing after a ball in the park.",
      "grooming_description": "The amount of grooming your Shih Tzu requires depends on the haircut you choose. If you really want to do justice to their pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00c3\u00a9sistance (that cascading, waterfall-like coat), you will be brushing them every day. Even if you keep a short-haired pup (about one to two inches all over), their coat still needs care about every other day. A pin brush is ideal for both cuts, so you can reach through all the layers of hair right down to their skin and keep their coat free of mats and tangles.\n\nYou also want to pick up a fine-tooth comb for their mustache and topknot, which you can either tie up into a snazzy little bow or have trimmed to a more manageable length by a groomer. And since they barely shed at all, you'll be able to catch most of those loose hairs when you brush them.\n\nTo keep them smelling good for all those cuddles you'll be getting, bathe your Shih Tzu every three weeks. This keeps their hair and skin healthy without stripping the natural oils from their coats.\n\nThe Shih Tzu dog breed often has either an underbite or an overbite, which makes them more prone to periodontal disease and other dental problems. So, it's important to keep their teeth healthy. While a yearly professional teeth cleaning by your vet is essential, don't forget to brush their teeth at home. Start your pup with toothbrushing once or twice a week and work your way up to daily brushing. You can also consider giving them a high-quality dental chew to help keep their pearly whites in great condition.\n\nIt's important to keep your Shih Tzu's nails short and trimmed every three weeks, as overly long nails can affect their gait, bleed when they break off or cause pain by piercing the soft pads of their paws. You'll know it's time for a trim when you hear that familiar tappity-tap on hard surfaces.\n\nBecause they have no shortage of hair growing in their ear canals, Shih Tzus' ears often become a host to infections and parasites. Trim that excess hair (with rounded shears) and check their ears for redness, swelling and debris every week. If you notice any of the above, go to the vet for a check-up. Your vet may recommend cleaning their ears.",
      "training_description": "The lovable Shih Tzu dog breed is notoriously attention-hungry, so the key to getting them to do what you want is to lay it on thick with praise and rewards. With the right blend of consistency, gentleness and firmness, you can overcome your pet's stubborn streak. It's important to keep practicing commands (like sit, stay and come) and obedience throughout your Shih Tzu's life. But remember to use only rewards and positive reinforcement methods. As this breed is prone to anxiety, raising your voice can backfire and cause your pet to misbehave even more.\n\nBecause they have small bladders, housetraining can be particularly challenging. Taking your Shih Tzu out every few hours or immediately after having an accident can help them learn to associate going outside with potty time. Crating your puppy for short periods when you're not around to supervise them can also help. (Learn more about crate training here).\n\nPuppy training and socialization classes are highly recommended; the earlier you start, the better. Though they naturally want to please you, they still have a mind of their own and could make a mad dash across the street if they see another dog. So, it's important to keep your pup on a leash when outdoors. If you need assistance in any aspect of training, look for a certified dog trainer in your area.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Shih Tzus typically do well with any high-quality commercial dog food. It should be easy to pick up and chew since this breed usually has either an underbite or overbite. For this reason, dry kibble is often the preferred option, but with whatever you choose, be sure to factor in your dog's age for a formula appropriate to their stage in life (puppy, adult, or senior). You may also choose to make your pup's meals at home. If you do plan to go this route, run the meal plan by your vet to ensure your pup gets all the nutrition they need.\r\n\r\nLike most small breeds, Shih Tzus should be fed two or three times a day. You can help nourish your pooch's glamorous coat from the inside out, as well as support muscle mass and joint health through a diet high in fat and protein with the right balance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.\r\n\r\nBecause Shih Tzus are not high-energy dogs, they are prone to excessive weight gain, so it's important to limit the treats you give them. Be sure to check with your vet for the proper mealtime and snack portions. Your vet is in the best position to make nutrition recommendations based on your dog's unique needs.\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget to keep your pup's bowl clean and filled with cool, fresh water throughout the day; they may be more thirsty than usual if they're on a dry food diet.",
      "exercise_description": "Bred to be the lapdog of emperors, the Shih Tzu is more well-suited for your air-conditioned living room than the rugged hiking trails of the great outdoors. That said, they do need some daily exercise to manage their moderate energy levels and stay healthy, though much less than what is required for bigger breeds.\n\nTaking your dog out for two to three 20-minute walks a day will help keep their bodies fit, and their minds entertained. Any longer may be difficult for this short-legged breed to endure. (Watch out for signs of exhaustion like heavy panting or lying down on the ground and refusing to budge.) Because they're moderately sensitive to heat, avoid the hottest times of the day for your walks and make sure to bring some water along, as well as a vessel for your pooch to drink from. Conversely, you'll want to dress them up in a fleece or jacket in the wintertime and keep their exposure to the cold to no longer than 15 minutes.\n\nSwitch up your daily routes for your Shih Tzu to experience different environments, like an open field or a sandy beach, and bring their favorite rubber ball for them to chase. Giving your Shih Tzu lots of opportunities for indoor and outdoor play will stimulate their minds as well as their bodies. You don't want this curious pup to get bored, as it can lead to behavioral problems like chewing on things around the house or even excessive barking.",
      "ideal_environment": "Shih Tzus are really in their element as long as they get to be with you. Whether that's part of a large family with lots of kids and four-legged pets, or just the two of you and a Netflix marathon, these companion dogs are happy just being by your side. But take note: Shih Tzu puppies should be supervised when playing with small kids and babies; this toy breed's small stature can make them vulnerable to injuries.\n\nThey can be good for new pet parents who are consistent with training (that royal strong-willed streak!) and are home often. A Shih Tzu will suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for long periods; if you're going to be gone for awhile, take your pup to doggy daycare or schedule a play date with a neighbor or friend.",
      "health_description": "The Shih Tzu has a life expectancy of 10 to 18 years and can be susceptible to a range of health issues. It'\u0080\u0099s important to be aware of potential health problems, so you can help your pup live their healthiest life possible.\r\n\r\n \tLiver Shunts: Shih Tzus are more likely to develop a liver shunt called portosystemic shunt (PSS) that prevents toxins from being removed from their bloodstream. This can lead to symptoms such as seizures or stunted growth. Ask your vet to test your pooch'\u0080\u0099s blood for this issue and conduct an ultrasound liver scan. Sometimes diet and medication may be enough to treat this disorder, but in other cases, your Shih Tzu may require surgery.\r\n \tBone and Joint Problems: Shih Tzus suffer from a few bone and joint problems, including patellar luxation and hip dysplasia. Patellar luxation is the condition where the kneecap slips out of place. Mild cases may be treated with joint supplements and pain medication, though surgery may alleviate more severe symptoms. Hip dysplasia causes the hip joints to form improperly and can lead to arthritis. Symptoms can include bunny hopping, limping or pain. A vet can diagnose it with X-rays and identify the right course of treatment which may include weight management, medication or, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tEye Problems: Eye conditions that could affect your pet include dry eye, glaucoma or cataracts. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don'\u0080\u0099t produce enough tears. Signs of dry eye include a thick discharge or pawing at the eye, and it can typically be treated with ointment. Glaucoma and cataracts both can lead to blindness if left untreated. It'\u0080\u0099s important to screen your Shih Tzu for these conditions as early as possible so they can be diagnosed and treated with medications and surgery as recommended by your veterinarian.\r\n \tKidney Disease: If your Shih Tzu has inherited glomerulonephropathy, their kidneys may fail at an early age. Clinical signs include lack of appetite, vomiting, increased drinking, increased urinating and weight loss. Your vet may recommend annual or semiannual bloodwork and urinalysis to check the health of your pup'\u0080\u0099s kidneys and identify any issues early. However, if your pet is showing any of the symptoms, please make an appointment right away.\r\n \tBrachycephalic Syndrome: Smoosh-faced cuties like Shih Tzus have anatomical changes to their nose and throat that make them prone to overheating and having trouble breathing. If your pet is experiencing any trouble breathing, see your veterinarian immediately.",
      "history_description": "Though their earliest ancestors can be traced as far back as 1000 B.C. in China, Shih Tzus as we know them in modern-day times originated in Tibet. These luxury lapdogs were given as gifts to Chinese royalty and were a favored house pet during the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.).\r\n\r\nThey were later bred with Pekingese or Pugs in a world-famous breeding program that fell apart when its founder, Empress Tzu Hsi, died in 1908. As a result, their numbers dwindled to only seven males and seven females, which were then used to rebuild the breed. Every Shih Tzu dog alive today is descended from one of those last 14 pups.\r\n\r\nAfter they were exported to England and other European countries, American soldiers stationed overseas brought the pups back to the US in the 1940s and 1950s. Since they arrived in the West, Shih Tzus have become a highly coveted breed, receiving American Kennel Club recognition as a member of the toy group in 1969. Famous celebrity pet parents include Bill Gates, Beyonce, Mariah Carey and Queen Elizabeth II.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to add a Shih Tzu as a pet? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Shih Tzu price? Expect to spend anywhere from $1,200 to $3,000 for a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Shih Tzu rescue organizations, keep an eye out at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.\r\n\r\nHave you seen teacup Shih Tzus online? Neither the AKC nor reputable breeders recognize these really small dogs. These pups have been bred for their small size and are often unhealthy. Sadly, these pups are touted as being \"rare,\" so they cost more. If you see a breeder who has these types of dog, find a different breeder.",

Their expressive and feathery tail spreads over the back of their double coat.",
      "temperament_description": "Happy-go-lucky is a Pomeranian's middle name, as their personality is equal parts friendly and inquisitive. They live for social interactions and to make their pet parents laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nIf you have kids at your house, you'll be glad to learn that aggressiveness isn't typically in this dog's nature. Pomeranians aren't known to be biters, although any dog may snap if provoked. So, teach children to handle dogs with care, and keep a close eye on toddlers and preschoolers who may accidentally drop or clutch this fluffy furball too tightly'\u0080\u0094it's easy to mistake a tiny Pomeranian for a favorite stuffed animal. Still, this breed is known to be rather compatible with their extended family, whether it includes other dogs, cats or children.\r\n\r\nNot only do they have the looks, but also the smarts. Poms have competency in spades and they're adept at picking up fun new tricks. If you're hoping to try obedience classes with your Pomeranian, this breed is keenly intelligent and likely to get good grades!\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the Pomeranian excels at jobs such as work as a therapy dog and is also known to make a fine watchdog since they're not afraid to bark. And if looking absolutely adorable is considered a type of employment, then a Pom fills this requirement too'\u0080\u0094and you should hire this fur baby, pronto!\r\n\r\nPomeranians are sometimes described as cocky, which likely refers to their proud gait and bouncy personality. Smart, perky and alert to everything around them, the Pomeranian breed's generally positive temperament makes them worthy of top-dog status in many types of families.",
      "care_description": "Pomeranians may look high maintenance, but there's more to them than a fluffy fur coat. Poms are super smart and will enjoy learning new skills. They're also active little pups, but it's easy to get their exercise in'\u0080\u0094even in your own home. (After all, they have really short legs!)",
      "grooming_description": "Keeping Pomeranian haircuts looking sharp requires a good bit of sudsing, so bathe your dog in warm water every one to four weeks. Blot dry with an absorbent towel, then use a hairdryer (but never leave a dog unattended under one). Brushing their teeth a few times a week (if not daily) is recommended, as is brushing the double coat a couple of times a week to remove shedding and matted hair.\r\n\r\nA wire pin brush is ideal for a Pom's thick coat and a small size works well on their various tiny haircuts, including the Pomeranian teddy bear cut (short body hair and longer face and ear fur that's cut in a circle'\u0080\u0094aww!) and the Pomeranian lion cut, which features closely clipped body fur and long head hair shaped like a mini mane (a tiny tuft on the tail is optional, but adorable).\r\n\r\nA complete Pomeranian grooming package, which is highly recommended every four to six weeks, will include bathing, brushing and a haircut (as needed), cleaning the teeth, ears, and anal glands as well as clipping the nails. Tap a pro groomer if you're not keen to handle some areas. And you should still see your vet for professional dental cleanings.",
      "training_description": "Go to the head of the class! Sign your Pomeranian puppy up for obedience training, and they'll quickly learn how to sit, stay and speak. And make good use of a small-dog leash\u00a0early on, attaching it to a halter rather than a collar. (Some Poms have tracheal issues, so a halter is safer.) The goal: taking advantage of that famous Pomeranian intelligence to teach them to walk nicely when leashed.\n\nHousebreaking is another important part of Pomeranian training, but know that accidents can happen, especially with tiny pups and their equally small bladders. Training pads are a good go-to inside. The Pet Parents washable dog pee pads with a non-slip backing, for example, are reusable and the neutral tones match most home decor.\n\nLet's talk about jumping. The \"off\" or \"down\" command is one to master right away to prevent energetic Poms from springing onto chairs, couches and beds. A Pom's \"big-dog bluster\" may lead them to think they can leap tall sofas in a single bound, but this practice could actually end with injured joints or even a broken bone.",
      "diet_nutrition": "As long as the chow you choose is complete and balanced, you can serve up either commercially prepared food or little meals you make yourself. (Just be sure to run these homemade concoctions by your vet to be sure they meet your pet's nutritional needs.) And, of course, be sure to consider your Pom's age when selecting the right kibble'\u0080\u0094which means puppy food for young dogs, adult food for adult animals, and a senior diet for your elderly Pomeranian.\n\nTreats are an important part of a dog's diet as they're necessary during training as well as to reward a very good dog when the moment arises. But don't go overboard with your handouts (or with your nightly scoops of dog dinner), as serving too-large portions can lead to an overweight Pom.\n\nAlways keep fresh water available so your pup can wet their whistle, and make a point of learning which human foods are safe to share on occasion and which are not.",
      "exercise_description": "Regular exercise is the goal for your Pomeranian (and you, too!), so get this sweet lapdog off your legs and into the backyard or to the park for some run-around time. A nice 20-minute walk a couple of times a day should do the trick. Just remember to watch your Pom like a hawk, as it's not unheard of for this breed to slip through holes in a fence or thick hedges or to scramble over short barriers.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of hawks (and owls), because Poms tend to resemble small rodents like squirrels, hedgehogs and rabbits, these winged predators may mistake your dog for their dinner and actually swoop down to carry a Pom away. Your best bet is to stay with your Pomeranian when out in fields or other large open areas at all times. A leashed pet is safest, rather than one who roams free, and always be aware of your surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe same layer of defense holds for bigger dogs you may encounter on your daily walks. Since some large pups may play rough with your Pom, it's wise to watch the path ahead and cross the street if you think a big breed may not mix well with your diminutive one.",
      "ideal_environment": "Nearly any type of family looking to add a small dog into their lives and homes would do well to consider the Pomeranian. This friendly breed is pleased to reside in small condos with adults or larger homes with a posse of pets and children. As a potential watchdog, a Pomeranian will alert their pet parents to arriving guests, deliveries and other action happening nearby.\n\nPoms can mesh well with active families and enjoy outings as long as pet parents allow this pup's short legs to keep the pace a reasonable one. Before heading out, Pom parents should always check the weather as high temperatures can overheat Pomeranians thanks to their fabulous double coat. Kids can easily entertain a Pom since games of \"fetch,\" and toys that squeak, bounce or crinkle are great for this breed. One to try: the Chuckit! balls, which come in a set of two in case one goes missing in the park.",
      "health_description": "The good news is that Pomeranians are generally healthy canines, though, like any breed, they have some health problems related to their tiny bodies that potential pet parents should learn about. Here'\u0080\u0099s more on the specifics:\r\n\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: Patellar luxation, which is when the kneecap pops out of place, can be painful, causing your Pom to limp or develop arthritis. In severe cases, surgery may be needed to correct this issue.\r\n \tCollapsing Tracheas: Collapsing trachea occurs when the rings of the trachea are weak and can flatten in a way that interferes with breathing. Symptoms range from mild goose honking cough to severe respiratory distress. If your pup suffers from collapsing trachea, a harness will be better than a traditional neck collar so as not to put pressure on the trachea when walking. Treatment can range from lifestyle changes such as weight management to medication for cough to surgery depending on the severity.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is also very common in Poms and can include such signs as lethargy, hair thinning, a dry coat and an increase in weight without necessarily eating more kibble. A vet can run a blood test to diagnosis this issue and it can typically be regulated with medications.\r\n \tHypoglycemia: This condition of low blood sugar is seen in very small or very active Poms. You would notice your dog acting weak, sleepy, drunk, trembly and possibly having seizures. Keeping your puppy fed on a regular schedule helps prevent this issue, and most pups outgrow it as they mature.\r\n \tHip Issues: The two hip concerns that can develop in Pomeranians are Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and hip dysplasia, both of which occur when the ball and socket of this joint don'\u0080\u0099t develop and grow properly. Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed.\r\n \tEye Problems: Pomeranians can occasionally exhibit eye problems, such as cataracts (cloudiness in the eye'\u0080\u0099s lens) and entropion, a condition that causes the eyelids to roll inward. These may be genetic and can be diagnosed and treated by a veterinary ophthalmologist, possibly with surgery.\r\n \tHair loss: Alas, this breed'\u0080\u0099s luxurious locks may be affected by Severe Hair Loss Syndrome or Pomeranian alopecia. Also known as Alopecia X or Black Skin Disease, it'\u0080\u0099s mostly seen in male Poms. There is no genetic screening test, but it is hereditary so affected dogs should not be bred.",
      "history_description": "The Pomeranian origin has European roots and was named for a region called Pomerania in today's Poland and Germany. Poms are actually related to the breed of larger sled-pulling Spitz dogs, characterized by their pointy ears, thick coats and a big tail that curves along the back. While Poms can trace their lineage to sled dogs in Iceland, the breed has officially retired from this cold-weather position. Still, you can imagine how their fluffy fur and outer coats would fit in nicely near the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nThe British are big fans of Poms, thanks to the prominence the breed gained after Queen Victoria of England spied this pup while on a trip to Italy. She returned home with Poms in her bags and proceeded to breed and show the dogs for many years. In fact, it's Queen Victoria who was largely responsible for the tiny size we associate with Poms today. Once a midsize dog of 30 pounds, Pomeranians now sit side by side with Chihuahuas and Maltese as one of the smallest breeds.\r\n\r\nPomeranians came to the United States in 1892 and are among the oldest of recognized American Kennel Club breeds, gaining the AKC distinction in 1888. In 1911, the American Pomeranian Club hosted its first specialty show'\u0080\u0094just for Poms!\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Pomeranian puppies today? Check this list of reputable Pomeranian breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. As for the average Pomeranian price, depending on the breeder, you might spend between $500 to $1,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to a Pom rescue organization to adopt a POm, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

Whether you'\u0080\u0099re at a farmer'\u0080\u0099s market, watching TV or hanging out at a brewery, the active Poodle is the perfect '\u0080\u009cplus one'\u0080\u009d for many of life'\u0080\u0099s little adventures.",
      "appearance_description": "Poodles come in three sizes: standard (a relatively large dog); miniature (a small dog); and toy (a teeny tiny dog). Here are the height differences: Standard Poodles are considered a large-breed dog and stand taller than 15 inches at the shoulder. Miniature Poodles are less than 15 inches tall at the shoulder. Toy Poodles are a small dog breed, and are no more than 10 inches tall at the shoulder. Regardless of their size, they all share the same breed standard, which is a fancy way of saying they all look alike. Their heights and weights are proportionate. And they all can be groomed in the same fanciful ways. In fact, when you think of the Poodle's appearance, you probably think of the big poufy pompadour and snowball-shaped socks.",
      "temperament_description": "Poodles have been typecast as prissy, silly or neurotic, but in reality, this active dog breed defies Hollywood stereotypes with their outgoing, friendly and eager-to-please personality. However, their temperament can be influenced by the mood of those around them: Poodles who live in chaotic households or homes where people are barely home may resort to attention-seeking behavior, such as barking or chewing. That'\u0080\u0099s because Poodles form deep, loving bonds with their pet parents and prefer to spend time with you over almost anything else.\n\nThat'\u0080\u0099s not to say they can'\u0080\u0099t be alone: Their innate intelligence enables them to excel in obedience and early socialization, so if you properly train them to be comfortable with being alone, they'\u0080\u0099ll be fine.

They adore spending time outdoors; socializing with people and pets; and of course, going on adventures with their BFF'\u0080\u0094you.",
      "grooming_description": "Poodles' distinctive, curly coat is frequently groomed in one of three spectacular ways:\n\n \tEnglish Saddle: shaved all over, except for puffs on the head, bottom of the legs and the top of the tail\n \tContinental: the traditional '\u0080\u009cFrench Poodle'\u0080\u009d cut\n \tSporting clip: face, feet, neck and base of tail are shaved, but a pouf is left on the head and tail while the rest of the body is cut to 1 inch, like a short blanket.\n\nYou don'\u0080\u0099t have to groom a Poodle like they'\u0080\u0099re headed to the show ring, though. Many pet parents opt to let their dogs go au naturel.\n\nLet'\u0080\u0099s clear up some misconceptions about their trademark froufrou coat. That distinctive cut'\u0080\u0094the furry '\u0080\u009cbracelets'\u0080\u009d on their ankles, followed by closely shaved legs known as the Continental clip'\u0080\u0094has a working dog background. Historically, people groomed Poodles that way to maximize their waterfowl-hunting abilities. The fur around their joints kept them warm in cold water, while the rest of their closely shaven body would reduce drag while chasing after ducks. Today, fancy Poodle styles are mostly for aesthetics. How you style your dog is completely up to you! Just be sure to follow these basic grooming tips:\n\n \tFor routine grooming, you'\u0080\u0099ll need a slicker brush to brush your pup every day; be sure to get all the way to the skin to prevent mats. The more thoroughly you brush your Poodle, the less frequently you have to bathe them.\u00a0You should bathe your Poodle every four to eight weeks unless they had a mud bath. You can find shampoos formulated specifically for Poodles, which can boost the color of light or white-colored poodles. Their fur will dry quickly (remember, they'\u0080\u0099re a water-loving breed) or you can use a high-velocity dryer designed for dogs.\n \tCheck their eyes for tear stains. Tear stains are streaks that discolor your pup'\u0080\u0099s fur. This eye discharge is your pup'\u0080\u0099s way of getting rid of debris in the eye. Even though the tears are clear, there'\u0080\u0099s a pigment in the tears that stains your dog'\u0080\u0099s hair. Use a damp washcloth or eye care wipes to gently clean the fur around your pup'\u0080\u0099s eyes. (Get more tips for getting rid of tear stains here.)\n \tYour Poodle'\u0080\u0099s cute and floppy ears also need some TLC. Check their ears at least once a week, looking for buildup, hair growth or bad odors. You may need to pluck or trim the hair in their ears with rounded shears. Ask your vet at your puppy'\u0080\u0099s first well visit what to watch for and how best to clean their ears.\n \tYour pup will need a haircut every four to eight weeks, right alongside bath time.\n \tIf you take your pup to the groomer, ask them to trim your dog'\u0080\u0099s nails. If you hear their nails clicking on the hardwood floor, though, you may need to give your pup a pedicure in between spa dates. (A nail grinder is great for this.)\n \tBe sure to brush your pup'\u0080\u0099s teeth daily. Have your vet show you how if you need help. Start brushing those pearly whites while your dog'\u0080\u0099s a puppy since Poodles are prone to periodontal disease, and have your vet professionally clean their teeth once a year for optimal dental health.",
      "training_description": "Socialization is the most important part of a young Poodle'\u0080\u0099s training. Poodles learn basic commands and tricks easily, but they may struggle with new environments and encounters if they weren'\u0080\u0099t properly exposed to different people, places and things when they were little. Bring them as your plus-one on errands as soon as your vet gives you the go-ahead so they experience lots of positive interactions in a variety of environments.\n\nLearn how to properly socialize a puppy.\n\nSimultaneously, you can teach them basic commands, like sit, stay and come as well as tricks, like shake their paw. Poodles proudly take on the role of teacher'\u0080\u0099s pet, relishing learning and training sessions with their pet parents. Devote 20 minutes or so every day to training, giving your pet a chance to show off what they know.\n\nAs your Poodle puppy grows and masters basic training, consider enrolling your dog in classes such as agility or Canine Good Citizen training. Classes can help keep your Poodle mentally stimulated and provide socialization.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Ensuring your pet'\u0080\u0099s well-being is top priority, and a significant part of their health revolves around their diet. Poodles typically do well on high-quality commercial dog food, but it'\u0080\u0099s important to tailor their meals based on their life stage, be they puppy, adult or senior.\n\nTo make the right choice, always look for dog food formulas that meet the standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (look on the packaging for a nutritional adequacy statement). This ensures they get all the nutrients they need.\n\nLike any other breed, Poodles are at risk for obesity. A pound or two of extra weight (or even just a few ounces in toy and miniature Poodle breeds) can lead to health problems. The challenge is to not feed your Poodle too many treats during training sessions. Coming up with a smart treat strategy is crucial.\n\nIn addition to dog-specific treats in moderation, consider offering healthier alternatives such as frozen blueberries, peas, cut-up carrots, pieces of cucumber or celery.\n\nWork with your vet to create a balanced meal plan; they'\u0080\u0099re in the best position to make recommendations specific to your individual pet.\n\nSometimes, food intolerances or sensitivities may lead to\u00a0 health problems, such as itchy ears or dry skin. In some cases, your veterinarian may suggest your Poodle steer clear of certain ingredients, like wheat, or add more of something like healthy fats for a lustrous coat and healthy skin.\n\nBy proactively managing their diet and treat choices, you can give your Poodle the best chance at a long, healthy and happy life.",
      "exercise_description": "Don'\u0080\u0099t let the '\u0080\u009cnon-sporting'\u0080\u009d label fool you: Poodles are high-energy athletes. They shine in competitive agility, obedience and tracking, and love getting in touch with their inner hunter by playing fetch and retrieving games with toys like disc toys and balls.\r\n\r\nThey'\u0080\u0099re capable jocks, to be sure, but they'\u0080\u0099re also suited to many activity levels. They need at least one hour a day of engaging exercise, whether that'\u0080\u0099s a casual daily walk or a trip to the dog run. Some may even enjoy jogging with you (just check with the vet before you embark on a couch-to-5K with your canine).\r\n\r\nSince Poodles are water retrievers, they love to play fetch in water with balls designed to float. They'\u0080\u0099re generally good swimmers and can have a lot of fun in the pool or on the lake. However, some Poodles may need a slow introduction to water. They also love running, digging and jumping, and don'\u0080\u0099t mind getting their coats dirty in pursuit of a good time.\r\n\r\nWhatever exercise route you choose, rest assured your Poodle will love every minute spent with you. Their enthusiasm and athleticism allows them to embrace all kinds of activity.",
      "ideal_environment": "Despite popular opinion that Poodles are persnickety, the Poodle dog breed is actually remarkably adaptable.Whether as a loving family companion or a devoted partner to a solo pup parent, Poodles excel in both roles thanks to their affable nature.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to kids, Poodles are usually great playmates, but be sure to consider a dog'\u0080\u0099s individual personality. Some Poodles used to being the center of attention might find sharing the spotlight with a high-energy toddler stressful. So if you need another reason to start socializing and training your pooch as a puppy, here it is. Remember to also teach children how to respectfully and safely interact with dogs, too.\r\n\r\nPoodles want to feel like valued members of the family, interacting with people throughout the day in and out of the home. If you need to leave your pup by their lonesome for a few hours, consider hiring a dog walker, enlisting the help of a neighbor or enrolling your pup in doggy daycare.",
      "health_description": "Poodles are a generally healthy dog breed. Like all dogs, they'\u0080\u0099re prone to certain health conditions, but compared to most other breeds, they have fewer genetic health issues.\r\n\r\nPoodles have variable lifespans depending on their size. Though exceptions exist, toy, miniature and standard Poodles can live up to 18 years. However, there are some health issues to be aware of to help your Poodle have a happy, long life.\r\n\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Poodles may be susceptible to hip dysplasia, a condition in which the ball and socket of the hip joint don'\u0080\u0099t fit together correctly, which can cause mobility issues. Hip dysplasia has a genetic and environmental component. The treatment is physical therapy, medication and surgery in severe cases.\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: This often-genetic orthopedic condition results when the kneecap is able to slip in and out of place resulting in potential lameness, pain and arthritis. Treatment options include weight management, joint supplements, pain medication and, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn'\u0080\u0099t produce enough thyroid hormone, which can lead to weight gain, lethargy and hair loss. Hypothyroidism is typically easily detected with a simple blood test and treated with an oral prescription medication.\r\n \tEye Issues: Some Poodles may be susceptible to eye issues, including:\r\n\r\n \tCataracts\r\n \tOptic nerve hypoplasia (a condition some dogs are born with)\r\n \tProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA)\r\n \tGlaucoma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of these can cause blindness, but surgery can treat cataracts and glaucoma. The good news is that Poodles can live a happy life even if they lose their sight and can learn to rely on other senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSebaceous Adenitis: This skin disease can inflame the sebaceous glands (glands on the skin responsible for lubricating the skin and hair follicles). This condition can lead to hair loss, scaly skin or irritated patches on the dog'\u0080\u0099s skin.\r\n \tMitral Valve Disease: Poodles can be prone to a heart condition where the valves on the left side of the heart leak. This usually is picked up by your vet as a heart murmur. If your vet hears a heart murmur, they will likely refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to determine the cause.\r\n \tAddison'\u0080\u0099s Disease: This endocrine condition often seen in Poodles occurs when the body does not make enough of its own natural steroid, cortisol. This can present as an acute emergency situation where the dog collapses or can be a more chronic presentation of weight loss, lethargy and vomiting/diarrhea. Your vet can perform blood tests to diagnose Addisons and start your pup on the necessary treatment plan. Preventative care is essential. Help your pup maintain a healthy weight; provide ample opportunities for exercise; and brush their teeth. Also, note any time your Poodle seems in pain or changes their behavior, such as losing interest in food or toys, or acting more lethargic or irritable than usual. If you see any of these changes, contact your vet.",
      "history_description": "Long before the Poodle'\u0080\u0099s regal reputation took root, the breed'\u0080\u0099s origins were far from the elegant, frou-frou and French associations they carry today. The Poodle may be the national dog of France, where they are known as the Caniche ('\u0080\u009cduck dog'\u0080\u009d), but the breed originated in Germany over 400 years ago. Bred for duck hunting, the Poodle was a specialized dog with a love of water. The term '\u0080\u009cpoodle'\u0080\u009d comes from the German word '\u0080\u009cpudelin,'\u0080\u009d or splashing in the water.\n\nIn ancient times, the Poodle'\u0080\u0099s ancestors were likely ship dogs who retrieved things that fell overboard (including people); guarded ships; and otherwise served as a trusty mate to deckhands. During the Renaissance, French nobility spotted these German duck hunters and, charmed by their good looks and endearing temperament, began bringing them into the courts as companions. Circuses, too, took note of Poodles'\u0080\u0099 good temperament and easy-to-train traits, and the Poodle dog became a circus-performing favorite.\n\nThe Poodle eventually found their way to the United States, though exactly when is a bit murky. In 1887, the American Kennel Club (AKC) first recognized the breed. Today, their distinctive style and winning personality make them stand out; the Poodle has continually been one of the most popular dog breeds in America. They rank in the top ten on the list of most popular dog breeds.\nHow do you get a Poodle as a pet?\nA purebred puppy can cost $700 to $2,000, a price you should only pay if your breeder screens their breeding stock for health issues. You can find reputable breeders at the AKC website.\n\nIf you'\u0080\u0099d prefer to adopt a Poodle, start by contacting the Poodle Club of America Rescue Foundation; visiting Chewy'\u0080\u0099s pet search; or looking for the breed at your local shelter.\n5 Poodle Facts\n\n \tThese dogs were initially bred in Germany to be duck hunters. Then France downsized them to be toys.\n \tThey're an incredibly versatile breed. They hunt; do agility, nose work, rally/obedience, therapy and service dog work; barn hunt; and do Fastcat (a 100-yard dash chasing a lure), conformation and tracking.\n \tIn the mid-1970s, one Iditarod participant created a sled team partially made of Poodles, and the dogs put up a good race against more traditional sled dog breeds like Huskies.\n \tPoodles can be clowns: joyous, friendly, eager to please, and they love their families. They want to be with their people.\n \tPoodle coats shed very little, making the breed a popular choice if you have allergies or want a dog that doesn'\u0080\u0099t require much vacuuming.",

      "temperament_description": "The Golden Retriever personality is naturally outgoing and eager to please. Although individual personalities can vary, most Goldens love people and social outings, thriving in homes with lively environments.\r\n\r\nGenerally, Goldens are born to mingle and see everyone as a potential new best friend. Whenever they meet someone new, they seem to say, '\u0080\u009cHi! I am so glad we met.

However, not all Goldens are without challenges.

They were and are bred to be gundogs, retrieving waterfowl with their soft mouths, a characteristic that allows them to carry delicate items without applying excessive pressure.

      "training_description": "The Golden Retriever dog breed is highly intelligent and eager to please, making them a joy to train. Goldens can easily master basic obedience training commands like sit and stay and even be taught to retrieve different toys by name. They respond best to positive reinforcement training, which uses treats or toys as rewards for desirable behavior.\n\nOf course, no matter how well-trained a Golden is, occasionally they'\u0080\u0099ll be more interested in goofing off than learning their lessons.\n\nIf you want to train your Golden for a particular job, like working as a service dog, remember individual personalities play a big role. Not every Golden is cut out for service dog work.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Experts generally recommend Goldens eat a complete and balanced commercial dog food, but there'\u0080\u0099s no one-size-fits-all feeding chart. Your dog'\u0080\u0099s individual needs will vary, based on their age, weight and activity level. Talk to your vet to figure out the best diet for your dog.\r\n\r\nGolden Retrievers can develop food allergies, which may cause itchy skin and excessive licking. You can manage these reactions by working with a veterinarian and changing their diet.",
      "exercise_description": "Golden Retrievers require lots of physical and mental exercise. Goldens can thrive in small homes if you help them stay active by:\r\n\r\n \tPlaying games, like fetch, chase and those that incorporate scent, like '\u0080\u009cfind it'\u0080\u009d\r\n \tOffering interactive dog toys\r\n \tProviding unstructured off-leash time\r\n \tTaking daily walks\r\n \tTaking them swimming (if possible)\r\n\r\nOf course, a large yard doesn'\u0080\u0099t give you an excuse to be lazy. Goldens want to be with you pretty much all the time (that'\u0080\u0099s why we love them!). Join them outside for playtime to help them burn off their endless puppy-like energy.",
      "ideal_environment": "Golden Retrievers love to have lots of room to run around, making them an ideal fit for a home with a large yard. However, they adapt easily and can also thrive in a congested city, so long as there are plenty of opportunities for exercise and mental stimulation. Remember, they have a natural instinct to retrieve, so offer them many positive outlets for that behavior.\r\n\r\nMany Goldens, especially young ones, do well in a bustling home with lots of activity (more people to love them), but as long as they get enough positive attention, they'\u0080\u0099ll adjust to most home environments.",
      "health_description": "Golden Retrievers have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years, but the Golden Retriever lifespan can vary greatly depending on many variables, such as weight, fitness level and illness. Some dogs can live to 14 without issue, while others can develop health problems well before that. The best thing you can do is follow preventative health protocols and know what those potential health problems are, so you can recognize and treat the signs quickly.\n\n \tCancer: The biggest health issue for Goldens is cancer, with up to 65% of them dying of cancer-related causes. Two of the most common types of cancer seen in Golden Retrievers are lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma. Your vet will help determine the appropriate course of treatment if your pup is diagnosed with cancer. It might include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery or palliative care/medications.\n \tSkin Infections and Allergies: The Golden Retriever breed'\u0080\u0099s thick undercoat can attract skin-irritating bacteria, resulting in rashes or hot spots. This can be further complicated by underlying seasonal or food allergies. If you notice your pet itching excessively or redness/rashes on their skin, please make an appointment with your veterinarian.\n \tHip Dysplasia: Roughly 8.5% of Goldens have hip dysplasia, which is a deformity of the hip joint that occurs during puppyhood, resulting in looseness of the joint and eventually degenerative joint disease and arthritis. Treatment options may include joint supplements, medication, and in severe cases, surgery.\n \tHeart Conditions: They are also prone to certain heart conditions, like subaortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the area just below the aortic valve (the valve where blood leaves the heart and travels to the rest of the body). This can sometimes be detected as an audible murmur during a veterinary exam. If a murmur is detected, your veterinarian will likely refer your pup to a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).\n \tHypothyroidism: Low thyroid hormone production is a common condition in Golden Retrievers. Symptoms can include lethargy, hair loss and weight gain. If concerned, please see your veterinarian for blood tests. Treatment is typically a daily medication.\n \tEye Conditions: Pigmentary uveitis is an inherited condition where cysts develop on the eye and can lead to cataracts and glaucoma. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is another genetic eye condition that can lead to blindness. If your pup is having any issues with their eyes such as redness, cloudiness, bulging, squinting, pain or trouble seeing, please contact your veterinarian immediately.",
      "history_description": "The Golden Retriever breed originated in the Scottish Highlands through the efforts of Dudley Marjoribanks, the first Lord Tweedmouth. Marjoribanks selectively bred different dog breeds to create an energetic pup who could retrieve objects from the water and on land.\r\n\r\nAmong the breeds that Marjoribanks used in his breeding program were the Yellow Retriever, Irish Setter, Bloodhound, and now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. He eventually developed a retriever with speed, agility and loyalty.\r\n\r\nGoldens began arriving in the United States in the early 1900s and gained recognition from the AKC in 1925. Their popularity skyrocketed when President Gerald Ford had a Golden Retriever of his own named Liberty. Now, many organizations are dedicated to the breed, such as the Golden Retriever Club of America.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Golden Retriever puppies? The American Kennel Club maintains a list of reputable Golden Retriever breeders. Expect to spend anywhere from $1,200 to $3,500 for a pup, depending on the breeder. When selecting a breeder, make sure they screen their dogs for health and temperament issues.\r\n\r\nYou can also reach out to Golden Retriever rescues to adopt a Golden, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter. You can find a local shelter through Chewy'\u0080\u0099s network.",

An energetic sporting breed, this popular pup lives for time spent in the Great Outdoors, especially when water is involved.

Their peppy personality and happy-go-lucky nature make for life's sweetest adventures.",
      "appearance_description": "The Labrador Retriever dog breed is generally muscular and stout with naturally floppy ears, wide noses and expressive eyes. They tend to have short, dense coats that repel water'\u0080\u0094no raincoats needed here!

Labradors come in three main colors: black, chocolate and yellow. You can find silver and white Labrador puppies, but they are not considered part of the breed standard.",
      "temperament_description": "Cheerful and animated, this large dog breed has stamina and energy to spare, able to keep up with your family and all your activities. You'll want to funnel that energy into positive outlets, like outdoor activities and training. And thanks to their high intelligence, learning commands and tricks come relativity easy for them. Labrador dogs love having a job to do and excel at things like agility courses and, just like their name implies, retrieving items. In fact, their superior intelligence is why they often make great assistance dogs, working as therapy or service animals.\r\n\r\nA people-pleaser, Labrador Retrievers have a pleasant personality and love interacting with humans. Get ready to be showered with lots of affection! They also easily make friends with dogs and other animals, including cats, although not all cats are as excited to meet them as they are'\u0080\u0094a Lab's large size and high energy level can be a bit intimidating. Slow and controlled introductions to other family pets will help make the transition go smoothly. Considering the staying power of the Labrador dog breed's popularity, it's a safe bet your Lab will fit right in with the all the loved ones you choose to introduce into their life.\r\n\r\nWhile they're generally good-natured, like any dog breed, Labs may develop aggressive tendencies if they don't receive proper training or have experienced abuse. Addressing any biting issues early on, providing proper socialization when they are puppies (aka safely exposing them to lots of new people, places and things) and working with a professional dog trainer can help avoid behavioral issues when they get older.",
      "care_description": "As you might expect with such a popular dog breed, Labs are relatively easy to care for and make great dogs for first-time pet parents. With the right tools and a little TLC, you'll be ready to help your pup live a healthy, full life. The toughest part about taking care of a Lab will likely be your ability to keep up with them!",
      "grooming_description": "A Labrador Retriever's grooming needs are fairly low compared to some other dog breeds.\r\n\r\n \tBrushing: Because a Labrador has short hair, they don't really need a haircut. However, they do shed a lot twice a year (the spring and fall), and you'll need to brush them every day during these high-shed times. For more routine maintenance, brush them at least once a week. Consider using a tool like the Furminator to help brush out the undercoat and remove the excess fur.\r\n \tBathing: Labs who spend most of their time indoors should be bathed every four to six weeks, using a dog shampoo. You can do this at home or have it done by a professional groomer. For those who get a lot of outdoor time, you should bathe them weekly. Daily rinsing is probably best if your pup's daily escapades get them a little too dirty.\r\n \tEars: Check your Lab's ears to be sure they'\u0080\u0099re debris-free. If you notice any swelling or redness, check with your vet; your pup may have an ear infection. Watch our guide for cleaning dog ears if your vet recommends you clean their ears at home\r\n \tTeeth: You should count on brushing your Labrador's teeth daily, using a dog toothpaste. If you'\u0080\u0099re not sure how to brush your pup'\u0080\u0099s teeth, your vet can teach you. (Watch our how-to video.) It's also a good idea to get their teeth professionally cleaned once a year by your vet.\r\n \tNails: Clip your Lab'\u0080\u0099s nails every 3-4 weeks or as soon as you hear them clicking on hard surfaces. You can do it at home, but a groomer or your vet can do it, too. It'\u0080\u0099s a good idea to start trimming your Lab's nails when they'\u0080\u0099re a puppy so they get used to it and don'\u0080\u0099t mind a trim when they'\u0080\u0099re older.",
      "training_description": "Labs are eager to please and intelligent, making them highly trainable. You can begin obedience school with your Labrador puppy between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months. They can learn the basics such as potty training, obedience commands'\u0080\u0094sit, stay and come when called'\u0080\u0094and leash skills. Labs can be leash-pullers and jumpers. To help train dogs more effectively, choose a headcollar to help prevent pulling and provide more control. A certified professional dog trainer can provide more guidance on correcting the issue.\r\n\r\nIn general, Labs are extremely friendly and do well in most social interactions as long as they are properly socialized. Introduce them slowly and safely to new people, other dogs and animals, nature and public settings as soon as they are vaccinated and your vet gives the \"all clear.\"\r\n\r\nLabradors really shine in advanced training sessions. As a sporting dog, they excel in agility competitions, hunting and other field activities. They also make excellent guide dogs for the blind and visually impaired, bomb- and drug-sniffing dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Labs typically do well on a high-quality commercial dog food. Be sure to factor in your dog's age and choose a formula that fits their stage in life (puppy, adult, senior). While there is no breed-specific standard feeding chart, your veterinarian can help you determine an appropriate feeding schedule and the best amount of food to meet your dog'\u0080\u0099s unique nutrition needs.\r\n\r\nBecause Labs are so active and always on the go, they may benefit from a high-protein dog food. As always, consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to your Lab's diet, as they are in the best position to help you pick a great dog food for your pup based on their individual needs.\r\n\r\nWhile treats are often used in training, be sure to limit the amount you dish out on the daily. An overabundance of dog treats, even if your pup is super active, is an easy way for them to pack on the pounds.",
      "exercise_description": "It's safe to say Labs are high-energy dogs. It's essential for them to have positive outlets to expend all that energy, like running and swimming. Take them for runs around the neighborhood or at the dog park, in addition to regular walks and hikes. At least one hour a day of exercise is ideal. Fair warning: A Labrador's speed can be challenging to keep up with. A great way to burn off their energy is to enroll them in agility course training or let them swim in a pool, lake or ocean if you have those options nearby.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of swimming, Labs absolutely love the water'\u0080\u0094they were, after all, bred to be waterdogs, retrieving fish and fowl. Lab parents should prioritize water-based outings as often as possible to ensure that their pup gets the precious water time they love. Since Labs are natural swimmers, dock diving makes for a fun exercise that will keep them entertained for hours on end.",
      "ideal_environment": "Labs want attention'\u0080\u0094and lots of it. Their ideal environment is, unsurprisingly, one where they can be smothered with cuddles, hugs and kisses. Because of their amicable attitude, these friendly dogs generally do well with kids and other pets, and they aren't likely to bark at or be aggressive toward strangers'\u0080\u0094of course, provided they've received proper socialization and training. Having friends over for dinner? Your good-natured Lab is likely to steal the show with their cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nLabs are extremely versatile and tend to flourish in many different environments, from urban to rural. In the city, you'll need to ensure they receive enough physical exercise and mental stimulation. In suburban and rural places, they'll have more room to run but you should still ensure they are getting their daily exercise. (A game of fetch is always a fun option for retrievers!) Without a doubt, Labs need an equally active pet parent who won't shy away from going on everyday adventures.",
      "health_description": "Labrador Retrievers are usually very healthy dogs with a typical life span of 11-13 years. However, there are a few common health issues you'\u0080\u0099ll want to be aware of'\u0080\u0094from joint problems to bloat'\u0080\u0094so you can keep your pup healthy for longer.\r\n\r\n \tElbow Dysplasia: When an elbow joint grows abnormally, your pup might experience stiffness, lameness or pain in their forelimbs. Treatment will depend on the primary cause of elbow dysplasia, but in most cases, surgery is recommended.\r\n \tHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia, where the femur doesn'\u0080\u0099t fit correctly in the hip socket, can lead to early signs of arthritis, including limping or general pain. Treatment ranges from weight management, joint supplements, pain medication or, in severe cases, surgery.\r\n \tProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA describes a number of diseases that can cause degeneration of the lining in the retina, which is in the back of the eye. In some cases, this condition can lead to blindness. There is no cure, but genetic screening testing is available.\r\n \tBloat: Bloat, otherwise known as gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is an emergency medical condition where the dog'\u0080\u0099s stomach becomes filled with gas and twists upon itself. This is very serious and can be deadly if not treated immediately. To help lower the risk of bloat in your Lab, avoid exercise for at least one hour before or after eating, try serving smaller and more frequent meals throughout the day or use a food bowl designed to slow down your dog'\u0080\u0099s eating.\r\n \tExercise Induced Collapse (EIC): EIC is a genetic condition seen in Labs that results in weakness and collapse after exercise. There is no cure, but the symptoms can often be managed with exercise restriction.",
      "history_description": "Originally called the St. Johns Dog or the lesser Newfoundland, Labrador Retrievers originated in Newfoundland (not Labrador), Canada, and are longtime descendants of the now-extinct St. John's Water Dog, a hunting dog. With their strong hunting heritage, Labradors first became popularized in the early 1800s as a waterdog who could help fishermen retrieve fish and ducks and bring them back to their boats. Their soft mouths and gentle jaws made them perfect for delicately handling birds and fish. Eventually, they were brought across the Atlantic Ocean to England after English nobles visited Canada. There, the English continued to refine the breed in the second half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the Labrador breed has only continued to grow since then. Today, modern Labs are among the most popular dogs in America, according to the American Kennel Club, which formally recognized the breed in 1917. Labs are mostly sought after for their unmatched diving aptitude and ability to work in the water, largely thanks to their water-repellent coats, webbed feet and otter-like tail.\r\n\r\nSo, where's the best place to find a Labrador Retriever puppy? You can find a list of reputable Labrador Retriever breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Labrador Retriever price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 for a pup. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Labrador Retriever rescue organizations to adopt a Lab, check Chewy's database of adoptable Labrador Retrievers, or keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter.",

They're playful pups who enjoy a good romp or game, even though it may not last long (depending on their energy level). And they love to snooze on laps and cuddle'\u0080\u0094that is, after all, what they're bred to do.\n\nThey like a lot of attention and are quite portable. But even though they're easily carried, they do still need to learn how to walk on their own and be able to engage in normal dog behaviors, like sniffing, exploring and playing. In other words, don't pop them in a purse or a stroller and tote them everywhere'\u0080\u0094unless, of course, it's somewhere risky with lots of feet that could hurt a tiny paw, like an airport or street festival.\n\nThe Chihuahua dog breed is said to resemble a terrier with their demeanor and can become quite feisty, especially if they feel threatened. Some sites report that the Chihuahua bite force is 3,900 pounds per square inch (psi), but those so-called Chihuahua facts are wildly inaccurate, when a lion is only at 600 psi. In truth, Chihuahuas usually inflict no more than a Level 1-3 bite, with no puncture deeper than half the length of one of their canine teeth.\n\nTo help your Chihuahua puppy overcome a nipping or protective tendency, socialize them by safely and slowly introducing them to new people and places from the get-go and start training when they are young. Early training will also help this smallest of dog breeds become wonderfully friendly and receptive to all members of the family, including other pets.",
      "care_description": "A Chihuahua puppy or adult, with their petite proportions and ease of portability, is easy to think of as low maintenance. In reality, Chihuahuas require daily exercise, regular grooming with special attention to dental and eye care, and early socialization and training. They are dogs'\u0080\u0094not toys'\u0080\u0094after all. The good news is they are so little, that grooming doesn't take very long to get through. And they're smart dogs who take well to proper training and socialization.",
      "grooming_description": "A Chihuahua's grooming needs tend to be on the low to average side, depending on whether they're long- or short-haired. Here are some grooming tips to keep in mind:\n\n \tBrushing and bathing: Both coat types need regular brushing and bathing.\n\n \tFor short-haired types, brushing your pup once a week is sufficient.\n \tFor long-haired Chihuahuas, brushing and trimming, especially on the legs and tail, are extra-important so the fur doesn't become matted. Brushing three times a week is a good goal. Just don't shave your Chihuahua in warm weather. The fur actually protects them from the sun and heat, and removing too much of it can result in sunburns and heatstroke.\n \tWhen grooming, pay careful attention to a Chihuahua's eyes. Their full, round eyes lend themselves to eye problems, especially toward the middle and later years of their lives. Take note of any squinting, swelling, rubbing, pawing, discharge or irritation in general. Eye problems range from common issues, such as dry eye, to more serious ones like glaucoma. (More on that below.)\n\n\n \tBathing:\u00a0To keep them fresh and clean, one bath a month will usually suffice, unless your pup has taken a roll in the mud.\n \tDental care: Routine dental care is important as dental disease is commonly seen in Chihuahuas. Brush your dog's teeth daily to reduce the chances of dental disease and keep up with their professional dental cleanings (performed by your vet annually). You want to get them used to teeth brushing when they're puppies so they don't fight it when they're older. Get a groomer or your vet to show you how to navigate those little Chihuahua teeth safely.",
      "training_description": "Despite the Chihuahua's terrier-like reputation, their intelligence makes them willing students for training, which they should start as puppies to prevent unwanted behaviors, such as growling, biting and resource guarding. Like teenagers, they will challenge the boundaries you set for them. Use positive reinforcement training methods to encourage the behaviors you'd like to see and to teach your Chi basic commands, like sit and stay. Early socialization'\u0080\u0094which entails slowly and safely introducing your young pup to new people, places and things'\u0080\u0094will help your dog be more flexible, adaptable and relaxed as an adult.\n\nThe Chihuahua bark is somewhat notorious. These dogs will alert you to everything they hear. Consult a certified dog trainer or certified behaviorist to reduce their sensitivity and reactivity. You can't entirely train the bark out of them'\u0080\u0094Chihuahuas like the sound of their own voice'\u0080\u0094but you can minimize the behavior with counter-conditioning and desensitization. Still, you should be willing to accept your Chihuahua for the potentially chatty canine they are.\n\nWhile Chihuahuas are poor choices for a service dog given their size, they make good emotional support animals for pet parents because of how bonded they become to their humans.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Feed your Chihuahua a high-quality dog food. To make sure it fits the bill, look for a statement on the package that says it meets nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). When feeding dry dog food, look for a smaller-sized kibble to fit in their smaller mouths. They also may benefit from a food formulated for Chihuahuas (like Royal Canin Chihuahua dry dog food) or small-breed dogs in general because those are designed to meet their specific needs.\r\n\r\nA common problem with very small dogs like the Chihuahua is overfeeding. Be careful not to overdo it'\u0080\u0094especially when it comes to treats'\u0080\u0094and, again, make sure they are being fed a healthy, complete diet. A 6-pound dog, ideally, should receive about 225 calories per day (including treats); if 50 calories of that are not nutritionally appropriate, that's about one-quarter of the dog's food.\r\n\r\nIt's best to talk to your veterinarian who can recommend the best food, portion size and feeding schedule for your pet, based on their individual weight, activity level and age.",
      "exercise_description": "Even though they are small, Chihuahuas still need regular exercise. Daily short walks are a must. Take your pup on a walk around the block or even in the backyard. Strenuous exercise like long-distance running is not recommended as they can tire easily and they're prone to knee problems. (More on that below.)\r\n\r\nMany Chihuahuas do not get enough exercise for their needs, even though they're easily met. That's because they're so tiny, pet parents tend to carry them more than they should. So make sure they get time to walk and run around on their own four little legs. For both physical and mental stimulation, consider buying interactive small dog toys to keep them entertained.",
      "ideal_environment": "Because of their compact size, the Chihuahua does really well in city environments. These medium-energy dogs get a workout simply by following their pet parents around the home. (Every step of yours is five to six for a Chichi.) That doesn't mean the Chihuahua can't do well in a suburban or rural neighborhood. Just be careful not to leave them outside and unattended. Even with a fenced yard, the dogs are tiny enough to become prey for a passing hawk or eagle.\r\n\r\nChihuahuas are best suited for adults or families with older children. They are delicate, so small children picking them up can accidentally drop them, causing fractures. Chihuahuas can be headstrong, stubborn or nippy, especially when you try to remove them from a favorite spot'\u0080\u0094or person.",
      "health_description": "Even though they have a life expectancy of 14-16 years, Chihuahuas are not without their health problems. Like many dogs who have been bred for millennia, Chihuahuas come with their own unique set of health issues. \r\n\r\n \tPatellar Luxation: Also known as luxating patella, this condition occurs when the kneecaps slip or dislocate. Treatment may range from joint supplements and pain medication to surgery, in severe cases.  \r\n \tHypoglycemia (low blood sugar): Because tiny dogs have very little fat storage, their blood sugar bottoms out easily. Symptoms include lack of energy, weakness, disorientation, tremors and, in severe cases, seizures. To help your Chi avoid developing hypoglycemia, you may need to offer multiple small meals throughout the day, especially when they'\u0080\u0099re puppies. \r\n \tBladder Stones: The Chihuahua is more likely than other breeds to develop bladder stones. Symptoms include smelly or bloody urine, inability to urinate, frequent urination and accidents in the house. Surgery may be required to remove the stones. To prevent them or minimize your Chi'\u0080\u0099s chance of developing bladder stones, talk with your veterinarian about possible changes to your pup'\u0080\u0099s diet. \r\n \tPortosystemic Shunt (PSS): In this disorder, the blood supply that'\u0080\u0099s supposed to go to the liver is shunted or diverted. Then, toxins build up. If your Chihuahua is not growing properly or has seizures, make sure your vet checks for this condition, which is typically treated with diet and medication or, in severe cases, surgery. \r\n \tHeart Disease and Other Cardiac Issues: Heart disease is a leading cause of death for this smallest breed. Chihuahuas are susceptible to several conditions, including mitral valve disease and Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA). Symptoms include coughing, fatigue, weakness, a heart murmur and weight loss. If you suspect your Chihuahua is having issues with their heart or your vet hears a heart murmur, they may need to see a veterinary cardiologist for an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).  \r\n \tHydrocephalus: Because of the shape of their heads, Chihuahuas are susceptible to improperly fused skull bones which can lead to excess fluid around the brain.  This can result in an increase in intracranial pressure. Symptoms include seizures, circling and an improper gait. When caught early, medications can often be used to treat the condition. In some instances, surgery is needed. \r\n \tEpilepsy: Chihuahuas can have seizures for several reasons, but if there'\u0080\u0099s no underlying disorder, then idiopathic epilepsy may be diagnosed. Treatment is typically daily medication.  \r\n \tEye Issues: Chihuahuas have big puppy dog eyes, making them more prone to eye issues. Common eye issues include dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS), glaucoma, cataracts and corneal ulcers. If you notice any signs of eye problems, such as redness, cloudiness, squinting, bulging or pain, please see your veterinarian immediately.  \r\n \tPeriodontal Disease: Extremely common in Chihuahuas by the age of 2, periodontal disease begins with tartar build-up and leads to gum infections and tooth loss. If not treated, the bacteria can get in the blood stream and affect the heart, liver and kidneys. Daily teeth brushing and regular dental checkups by your vet are key to preventing this disease.",
      "history_description": "Chihuahua history is ancient. The Chihuahua dog breed is named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where they originated and may have developed from the Techichi, the tiny dog kept by the Toltecs as early as the 9th century AD. However, one clear distinction between the Techichi and the Chihuahua: The Techichi was essentially mute, and the Chihuahua is, well, clearly not.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting Chihuahua fact: While the American Kennel Club did not officially recognize Chihuahuas as a breed until 1904, they were first noticed in the mid-19th century. And while they were isolated from other breeds for 9,000 years or more until Mexico was colonized, modern Chihuahuas retain four percent of their Chihuahua original genes that predate contact with European dogs.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the best place to find Chihuahua puppies today? You can find a list of reputable Chihuahua breeders on the American Kennel Club's website. What's the average Chihuahua price? Depending on the breeder, expect to spend anywhere from $500 to $1,500 for a pup, with the average dog going for $800. But for that, you usually get a dog who's been screened for health and temperament issues, and they might even come with pedigree papers. You can also reach out to Chihuahua rescue organizations to adopt a Chihuahua, keep an eye out for the breed at your local animal shelter, or search Chewy'\u0080\u0099s database of adoptable dogs in your area.",

Some people think that the short-haired (smooth coat) Chihuahua is easier than the long-haired (long coat) for those who have allergic symptoms to dogs, but that's not true. The Chihuahua sheds a low to moderate amount, and dander (and even their saliva) are what triggers an allergic reaction.

So, some like it and some don't. However your Chihuahua takes to water, remember their little limbs will tire easily."

This breed has dark brown eyes and a solid black nose with a docked tail that stands up straight. Their color combos come in salt and pepper, black and silver, or solid black.",
      "temperament_description": "The Miniature Schnauzer's size is small, but in many ways, this gregarious breed acts like a big dog in a small body. Feisty and spunky top the list of their qualities. But despite their larger-than-life personality, this breed is also sweet and affectionate, happy to snuggle with you on the couch. Mini Schnauzers are very attached to their people and want to be wherever you are at all times.\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzer dogs are generally good with children. They're loving little dogs who are always ready to play. The children in their lives must understand how to play gently with small dogs, though'\u0080\u0094kids, especially younger ones, sometimes play too rough with smaller dog breeds. Miniature Schnauzers' friendly temperaments often lead them to pair well with other pets, although their big personality can sometimes mean they confront larger dogs, and their terrier prey drive may stand in the way of friendships with small animals. (They do like to chase.) Start socializing your dog early, so they'll be well-behaved around smaller children and other pets.\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzers bond so strongly with their families that they can be aloof toward new people coming into the home. But as soon as your pup sees you interacting with a stranger, they'll likely be friendly toward the new person, too. And while Miniature Schnauzers are very noisy, they're not known to bite. Again, proper socialization and training for this eager-to-please breed will go a long way.",
      "care_description": "In general, the Miniature Schnauzer's needs match their stature: relatively small. They're highly trainable, and their exercise needs are pretty average. Grooming a Mini Schnauzer is a bigger task, but with the help of a professional groomer, you'll be able to learn the ropes.",
      "grooming_description": "First, the good news: Miniature Schnauzer shedding is minimal. However, this breed does call for regular grooming, which includes trips to the groomer every four to six weeks, baths at home a few times a month and brushing with a slicker brush every day. You'll become well-acquainted with your pup's hard top coat and downy undercoat. Before a bath, Schnauzers need \"hand stripping,\" a term that refers to removing the dead hairs from the dog's topcoat using a special knife. (If you're not showing your dog, you can have the groomer take care of the coat with clippers.)\n\nIn addition to monthly baths and daily brushing, you'll want to trim your dog's toenails at least once a month. When you hear the nails clacking on the floor, you'll know it's time.\n\nBrush their teeth every day with dog toothpaste and a dog toothbrush. Regular tooth brushing is important to keep your dog's teeth and gums healthy. If possible, start brushing your dog's teeth when they're still a puppy, so they'll grow up already used to the ritual. You'll also want to visit your vet for a professional tooth cleaning once a year.\n\nFinally, check your Miniature Schnauzer's ears every two weeks for debris or excess wax; the hair growing inside them, if untended, can cause infection. If you notice anything, speak to your vet.",
      "training_description": "Miniature Schnauzers are intelligent dogs who love to learn. They think learning new things is fun, and they're eager to please you, which helps makes them less distractible and easier to train. You'll likely find your Miniature Schnauzer is highly engaged and ready to do whatever they can for you. Basic obedience training (learning commands like sit, stay, come and how to walk nicely on a leash) will be a breeze, and many Mini Schnauzers love learning additional tricks they can show off, like shaking their paw.\n\nSometimes, your Miniature Schnauzer puppy might show their stubborn side during a training session. Remember to be patient and consistent, and take a break so neither of you gets frustrated.\n\nBe sure to socialize your naturally friendly pup, safely introducing them to new people, other dogs and experiences while they're young. Take them on walks and let them meet'\u0080\u0094and sniff'\u0080\u0094new people and other dogs. Enroll in puppy school, where they'll learn to play nicely with other puppies and meet new people'\u0080\u0094all in one place.\n\nMiniature Schnauzers are part of the Terrier group, and terriers like to make their voice heard! You can't train the bark completely out of your pup, but you can help curb it. Pro tip: Train them to recognize an \"all clear\" signal that lets them know you've heard them and recognized the reason they're barking. This way, your dog is allowed to tell you when they notice something happening, but can quickly quiet down when you give the sign. Think of it as an '\u0080\u009con/off\" switch for your dog.",
      "diet_nutrition": "Miniature Schnauzers will thrive on a diet consisting of a high-quality commercial dog food. Check the packaging for a statement that says the food meets nutritional standards set by AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) to make sure you're purchasing a complete and balanced product. If you're not sure about portion sizes, your vet can help you figure out the right amount of food for your pup. Make sure you also select a dog food that's made for your dog's age and stage in life (puppy, adult, or senior).\r\n\r\nMiniature Schnauzers have a predisposition for hyperlipidemia (also known as high cholesterol) and pancreatitis. Often, this means they should be fed a moderate- to low-fat diet, but check with your vet first. Avoid table scraps, and consider giving your dog low-fat treats.\r\n\r\nIf you have specific questions about what to feed your dog and how much, chat with your vet. They are in the best position to give you advice about your pup's mealtime.",
      "exercise_description": "Fairly energetic and playful, Miniature Schnauzers need about 45 to 60 minutes of exercise every day. If you don't have a fenced yard, a good long walk on a leash will meet your pup's daily energy requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to going for walks, Miniature Schnauzers enjoy playing fetch and running around (they can be speedy pups!). Some Schnauzers may even enjoy swimming, if trained to do so. While the breed as a whole doesn't naturally love water, some Miniature Schnauzers can learn to enjoy a dip on a hot day. (Never force your dog to swim if they don't want to, of course.) You should always closely supervise your Schnauzer around bodies of water and make sure they wear a dog life jacket, as these dogs aren't necessarily strong swimmers.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to provide your Schnauzer with plenty of mental stimulation. Playing games inside or going to a training class can help wear out your dog mentally and meet your Miniature Schnauzer's exercise needs.",
      "ideal_environment": "Miniature Schnauzers are affectionate dogs who make great family pets. These dogs are generally a good match with kids, their playful antics keeping children entertained. Miniature Schnauzers are also normally friendly with other dogs and with cats.\r\n\r\nThe Miniature Schnauzer breed is highly adaptable, making them a great option if you live in a small apartment or in the city. Still, they appreciate having outdoor space to run and play. As long as you're able to give your pup the daily exercise they need, they'll be perfectly happy in a small city apartment. If you do live in a home with a yard, make sure your yard is fenced'\u0080\u0094terriers love to chase things, and Miniature Schnauzers are prone to taking off if they spy a critter they feel needs chasing.\r\n\r\nIf you've never had a dog before, a Miniature Schnauzer will make your job easy. Their outgoing personality, trainability and relatively average exercise needs mean this breed is a great fit for a new pup parent.",
      "health_description": "Miniature Schnauzers have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years, and overall, the dog is a fairly healthy breed. The good news is that many of their common health conditions can be avoided if you feed your Schnauzer a proper diet and provide plenty of opportunity for exercise.\r\n\r\n \tPancreatitis: Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is a serious condition which often requires hospitalization for treatment. While the cause is not completely understood, there is likely a genetic component and eating foods high in fat may be a component.  Long-term management often includes a strict low-fat diet.\r\n \tDiabetes Mellitus: Miniature Schnauzers are prone to diabetes which can be caused by a pre-existing condition, like pancreatitis, obesity, Cushing'\u0080\u0099s disease or genetics. Diabetes in dogs is typically treated with insulin therapy and sometimes diet changes.\r\n \tCataracts: Miniature Schnauzer are prone to developing cataracts both as an inherited condition and secondary to diabetes. Often they can be surgically removed.\r\n \tBladder Stones: Bladder stones are often caused by diet or other conditions in the bladder, like a bladder infection. Symptoms include urinary accidents, straining to urinate and blood in the urine. If your Miniature Schnauzer has bladder stones, they may need surgery to remove them. Diet changes might be necessary post-surgery to prevent more stones from developing.\r\n \tPortosystemic Shunt: A portosystemic shunt, or liver shunt, is formed when blood vessels bypass the liver and is often caused by a birth defect. Symptoms include stunted growth, increased drinking and urinating, as well as circling or head pressing. Treatments often include diet change, medication, and in some cases surgery.\r\n \tMyotonia: Myotonia congenita is a genetic muscle disorder that causes a schnauzer'\u0080\u0099s muscles to stay contracted. A DNA test will show whether your dog or their parents are carriers of the myotonia gene. The condition can be managed with medications.\r\n \tVon Willebrand Disease: If a dog has this inherited disease, their blood can'\u0080\u0099t clot correctly. Typically dogs with this condition are asymptomatic in their daily lives but may need blood transfusions if they have an injury or need surgery.\r\n \tMycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC): MAC is a very rare but lethal defect of the immune system that causes overwhelming infection in affected pups. A genetic screening test is available so be sure to ask your breeder.",
      "history_description": "As you might have guessed from the sound of the name \"Schnauzer,\" these dogs originated in Germany'\u0080\u0094specifically Germany in the 19th century, when the Standard Schnauzer was bred with the Poodle and the Affenpinscher to create a whole new type of dog. Miniature Schnauzers were originally used as farm dogs, working as ratters and guard dogs.\r\n\r\nBreeders in the United States began breeding Miniature Schnauzers in the 1920s, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1926. There are three types of Schnauzers'\u0080\u0094Miniature, Standard and Giant'\u0080\u0094and each one is considered a distinct breed.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Miniature Schnauzer has become a popular breed; they currently rank No. 19 out of the 197 dog breeds recognized by the AKC. If you're looking for one, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a Miniature Schnauzer puppy to welcome into your home. Work with an AKC-registered breeder to locate the best dog for you. A purebred Miniature Schnauzer price is normally between $500 and $2,000. But for that, you're likely getting a pup who's been screened for health and temperament issues and may come with pedigree papers.

As a breed, Mini Schnauzers aren't naturally strong swimmers who don't naturally love the water'\u0080\u0094but there are exceptions. If your Mini Schnauzer does enjoy a dip, make sure they're supervised and wearing a life jacket at all times."
