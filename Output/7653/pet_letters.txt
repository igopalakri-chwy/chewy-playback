Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 7653
============================================================

Dear Human, We, your faithful companions, Francis and Moe, are having the time of our lives! Our excitement knows no bounds whenever we see the unique, patterned bowls you bring for us. It's as if they are filled with a world of flavors that we can't resist! And, oh boy, the colorful nail caps you got for us? They make us look super stylish! And, of course, the dual charger for our training collars! It keeps us active and ready for fun. Signed with paw-shaped love, Francis and Moe.
