Imagine a warm, playful scene with Chompie, the small Cockapoo, and Nala, a generic cat. Chompie is energetically gnawing on a chew bone, his tail wagging with excitement. Beside him is a dish of small chunk dog food and a chewable joint health supplement. The food dish subtly displays the Chewy logo. 

Nala is elegantly perched beside a cat litter box, which is filled with fresh-scented cat litter. A pack of wet cat food and chicken pate are nearby, their tops easily popped open. 

In the background, a bag of dry dog food with a Chewy label is conveniently stored. The scene is full of joy and energy, as the pets enjoy their Chewy products.
