Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 6205413
============================================================

Dear Human, 

Oh, the joy of a new letter! It's us, your feline family: Savory, Purrfect, Luna, Fancy, Cocoabean, Beyond, and Primal. We've been keeping our eyes on your activities and we must tell you, we appreciate you so much for the recent goodies you brought home. The taste of the natural chicken, tuna, and salmon treats - oh, it's like a gourmet seafood party in our mouths! It's been the purrfect incentive for Cocoabean to endure her eye drops. Clever, human! 

We've also been enjoying the new climber, although Luna has expressed some concerns about its size. She's growing, you know. On the subject of grooming, that new comb is a blessing! It's perfect for those pesky small mats and for getting rid of fur we didn't realize we had. 

The canned food, oh, the canned food! We've been licking our plates clean. It's so soft and tasty, even our older family members can enjoy it easily. And that soft cone recovery collar was a great choice for Cocoabean. It wasn't fun, but it was better than what the vet offered. 

We've also been having a blast with the dangly egg buddy toy. It's simple, but oh so entertaining. And the raw food nuggets you've been mixing with our regular food, they're quite a treat. We especially love the rabbit version. 

That's all for now. We're looking forward to more fun and yummy treats. 

From: Savory, Purrfect, Luna, Fancy, Cocoabean, Beyond, and Primal
