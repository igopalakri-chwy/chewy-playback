From Pet:

Human,

Hey there, it's me, your favorite four-legged whirlwind of excitement and wagging tails! You know, just sitting here in my favorite spot by the door, I figured it was about time I put paw to paper to tell you how much you mean to this curious nose and these constantly wagging paws of mine.

First off, thanks for always grabbing that Flexi Explore leash for our adventures. I can't tell you how much I love stretching these legs—it's like each walk is a new world to explore! From the way you laugh when I find a particularly interesting scent to the way you gently tug when I've strayed a bit too far, it makes every journey feel like a story waiting to unfold.

And oh, that Sugar Plum harness! I strut with a bit more pride when we snap it on, don't I? It’s like I’m royalty, parading down the street with the best human any dog could dream of. Plus, it’s reflective, so everyone can see just how fabulously safe we are together! 

I know you’re always keeping an eye out for my peepers, making sure they’re sparkly and healthy—just like you've always looked out for me in every little way. Sometimes, I don't say it enough (or at all, because, you know, barking is more my thing), but your care means the world to me.

Every day, you fill my bowl with love and tasty surprises. I’ve got to say, the tiger print bowl? It makes me feel fierce, even when I'm daintily crunching down my kibble. It’s as if each meal is a grand feast, complete with a touch of wild flair!

So here's to more walks, more cuddles, and endless wagging tails. You’re not just my human—you’re my world. Thanks for being the best part of every single day.

With all the love and licks a mixed-breed heart can muster,

Pet 🐾
