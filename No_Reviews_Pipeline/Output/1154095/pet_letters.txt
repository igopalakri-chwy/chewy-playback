Human,

Hey there, you magnificent two-legged ball of joy!

I just wanted to take a moment away from my rigorous schedule of chasing imaginary squirrels and chewing on my beloved Tampa Bay Lightning hockey stick toy to tell you how much you mean to me. You know, in case all the wagging and face-licking hasn't been enough to clue you in.

Remember yesterday when you dressed me up in that hysterical hot dog costume? I pranced around like I owned the place, even if it was just the living room. I'm pretty sure I heard you laugh until you snorted. Those are the moments I live for ‚Äî not just the treats or the high-protein dinners (though keep those coming, please), but the joy we share.

I love how curious you are about my world. Like when I poke my nose into your business, sniffing out the latest mystery from your shopping bags, and you laugh instead of shooing me away. It's those little things that make my tail wag even faster.

When we go for our walks, you let me lead the way, even if it‚Äôs just to the best-smelling fire hydrant. And on those nights when the stars are twinkling above us and I'm wearing my reflective fly mask (because safety first!), I feel like the world is just me and you, exploring infinite adventures.

Your heart is my favorite place to be, and your lap is a close second. Thank you for being my human, for understanding my playful barks, and for the endless cuddles. You're the best team captain a small but mighty mixed breed like me could ever ask for.

With all my paws and heart,

Pet üêæ
