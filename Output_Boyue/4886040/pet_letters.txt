Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4886040
============================================================

Hello hooman! Your furry family is here to tell you how much we love our new toys and treats! First, Dewbert has been having a blast with a squeaky ball toy. It's become his absolute favorite, and he doesn't even look at his old toys anymore. All of us kitties are relishing the healthy snacks you got. You might think you’re just spoiling us, but we know you’re giving us quality stuff, and we purr in thanks! And oh boy, the teething stick you got for Sophie is a hit. She is thoroughly entertained, even with her teething woes. To top it off, we all enjoy the delicious canned puppy food. We can't get enough of it! The food storage bins on our patio are pawsome too. They are secure, look good, and keep our food fresh and safe from nosy critters. Sophie seems to be learning not to pull on her new lead, and the behavior control treats are working like magic. The indoor ball is a bit chewed up, but Sophie enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you for keeping us happy and healthy! Love and purrs, Two, Acd, Sophie, and Dewbert.
