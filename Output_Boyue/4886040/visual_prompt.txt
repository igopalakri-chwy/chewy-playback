Imagine a warm, playful scene in a spacious living room. Dewbert, a generic domestic cat, is joyously batting a squeaky ball toy around. Acd and Two, also domestic cats, are happily munching on healthy snacks from a Chewy-branded bowl. Sophie, a large, playful German Shepherd puppy, is enthusiastically chewing a teething stick. Nearby, a can of puppy food sits open, its contents looking fresh and delicious. Outside, on a patio claimed by the pets, stand two secure food storage bins, subtly emblazoned with the Chewy logo. Sophie is learning not to pull on her new lead, while some behavior control treats sit nearby. Finally, the remnants of an indoor ball toy are scattered playfully, evidence of a young and learning dog's enthusiastic playtime.
