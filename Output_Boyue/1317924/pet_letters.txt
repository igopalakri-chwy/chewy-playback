Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Dear Human,

Purr! Meow! Woof! We're tail-waggingly thrilled to report that there's a lot of yummy stuff happening around here. It's like every mealtime is a party! We've been chomping down on some delicious fishy canned food for us kitties, and it's just purr-fect. It's not too soupy, and it's full of meaty chunks. We lick our bowls clean every time. Woof, and the apple and ginger flavored treats? Tail-wagging good! Sindel has been having a blast with her long-lasting chewy bone too. She plays around with it before she finally settles down to chew. It keeps her busy for ages!

Oh, and the clumping clay cat litter? It's awesome. We feel so much more comfortable doing our business now. And the variety packs of food? A total hit! They're just right for picky kitties like us. Even our doggie friend Sindel has been enjoying her venison pate and salmon food. She doesn't go crazy for it, but she's happy to munch it down. So, keep up the good work, human. We're all very satisfied with these new additions.

With purrs, meows, and tail wags,
From: Beatrix Kiddo, German, Bff, Sindel, Wet, and Gsd
