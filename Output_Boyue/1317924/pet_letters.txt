Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1317924
============================================================

Hello Human,

It's us, your beloved fur family, Sindel, Bff, Gsd, Beatrix Kiddo, German, and Wet, writing to you! We've been having a tail-wagging time lately and thought we'd share some of our joy with you. We've been having a blast with the tasty wet food with chunks of meat - it's purrfect! We can't get enough of it. Beatrix Kiddo especially enjoys the variety of flavors in each bite.

Sindel has been really enjoying her jerky bone rawhide treats. She plays with them for ages before finally giving in and chewing on them. They really keep her entertained when you're out of the house. And don't even get us started on the apple and ginger flavor dog treats - they're a total hit! Sindel thinks they're absolutely paw-some. Also, the maple bacon dog treats are a tasty little snack, even though they disappear in one bite!

We've also noticed that the litter box has been extra fresh recently - we appreciate that. It clumps well and controls any unpleasant odors, making our litter box experience much more enjoyable. Thanks for taking such good care of us!

Stay pawsome,
From: Sindel, Bff, Gsd, Beatrix Kiddo, German, and Wet
