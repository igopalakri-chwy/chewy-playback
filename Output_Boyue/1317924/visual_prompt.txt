Imagine a warm, cozy living space with a subtle Chewy logo on a food bowl. There are six pets: five domestic cats of varying colors and a large German Shepherd dog. Beatrix Kiddo, the cat, is a picky eater, and is seen sniffing a can of delicious fishy food with evident delight. German, Bff, Wet, and Gsd, the other cats, are gathered around a variety pack of cat food, their eyes wide with anticipation. In one corner, Sindel, the large German Shepherd, is happily gnawing on a chewy bone. There's a pack of apple and ginger flavored treats nearby, subtly branded with the Chewy logo. The living space also features a litter box filled with clumping clay cat litter, which seems to be a hit with the cats. The scene is full of life and joy, with each pet enjoying their Chewy treats.
