Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 5025337
============================================================

Woof woof! Hello from us, the fun-loving bunch of Biewer Terriers, Turkey, Harley (James) Davidson, The Princess Monaco, and Venison! We've been having a tail-wagging good time lately, thanks largely to the delicious food and treats you've been getting for us. Oh boy, do we love the freeze-dried nuggets, whether they're rabbit, venison, or turkey and sardine flavored! We lick our bowls clean every time, leaving no crumb behind. And those freeze-dried duck treats? Scrumptious! They're even soft enough for our elder sibling to munch on. Not to mention, those crunchy chicken shredders that we beg for more of! We've also been enjoying the training pads, which are just the right size for us little guys. They're so easy to use and keeps our indoor area nice and clean. We wanted to express our zoomies of joy and gratitude! Loving these goodies and the love you shower on us. Woof you! From: Turkey, Harley (James) Davidson, The Princess Monaco, and Venison
