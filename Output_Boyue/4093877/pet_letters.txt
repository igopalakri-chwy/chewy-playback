Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 4093877
============================================================

Dear Human, 

Just a quick paw-written note from us, Tuxedo and Shaomaomi (Loving Kitty). We've been having a purrfect time with all the tasteful delights you've been getting for us. We absolutely love that soft and appetizing pate. It's just the right texture for our little feline teeth and oh so delicious! We were skeptical at first, but that beef and liver recipe wet food was a hit! Who knew we had such a thing for liver? The grain-free trout and catfish pate is also something we look forward to at meal times. It's like a little fish festival in our bowls! 

We've noticed you trying to sneak up on us with that finger toothbrush. Nice try, but we're too smart for that! Maybe next time, try distracting us with some of that chicken flavor dry food that we can't resist. It's the only thing that could possibly make us sit still for a brushing session. 

Keep the good stuff coming! We're always ready for a new flavor adventure. 

From: Tuxedo and Shaomaomi (Loving Kitty)
