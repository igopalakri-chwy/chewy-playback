Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 1183376
============================================================

Dear Human, We've been having the best time with all the new things around here! That twisty toy you got us has been a huge hit. We can't stop playing with it, it's just too exciting! And oh, the food! That tasty, grain-free food and the beef & carrots meal have our tails flicking in delight, we can't wait for meal times. And the special food that helps keep our urinary tracts healthy? Purrs of appreciation! Plus, those pill pockets you've been sneaking our daily meds in? Sneaky, but we love them. They taste like yummy salmon! The festive reindeer sweater and comfy scarf sweater you got for Elwood have been such a treat. He's been strutting around showing off his stylish wardrobe! And that mouse toy, it's as good as chasing the real thing. The double-wide scratcher has also been great for our claws - it's like having our own little gym! And the food that's supposed to be good for our teeth? It's an added bonus that we love it too! Lots of love and purrs, Turbo, Elwood, and the unnamed one.
