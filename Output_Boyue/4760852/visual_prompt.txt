Imagine a cozy home scene featuring Chompie and Nala. Chompie, a small Cockapoo, is playfully gnawing on a dental chew bone. His coat is a fluffy mix of colors, reflecting his cheerful and energetic nature. Near him, there's a small bowl labeled with subtle Chewy branding, containing some leftover small chunks of wet dog food.

On the other side, Nala, a generic domestic cat with an air of finicky elegance, is happily licking her paws after finishing her meal of thinly sliced gravy food from a Chewy-branded can. Next to her is a cat litter box filled with fresh-scented cat litter. The litter box has a small Chewy sticker on it.

The room is filled with the warm ambiance of pet-friendliness and the subtle presence of Chewy products without overt advertising.
