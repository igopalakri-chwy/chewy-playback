Imagine a warm, playful scene in a living room. Seven cats are scattered around, engaged in various activities. Cocoabean, a domestic cat with a unique coat, is enjoying some gourmet seafood treats. Savory and Beyond, two domestic cats, are playfully scrambling up a small climbing tree. Luna, a beautiful Maine Coon, is lounging nearby, her long tail draped over the side. Purrfect and Fancy, two domestic cats, are nibbling on soft, canned food. Primal, another domestic cat, is batting at a dangly egg buddy toy. A soft cone recovery collar rests on the side, a reminder of Cocoabean's recent surgery. A comb lies next to a pile of loose fur, evidence of a recent grooming session. On a nearby table, a bowl of water is soaking some raw food nuggets, ready to be served. The scene is busy, but peaceful. In the background, a poster hangs with a subtle Chewy logo, a gentle reminder of where all these wonderful products came from.
