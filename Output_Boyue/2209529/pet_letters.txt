Collective Letter from All Pets for Customer 2209529
============================================================

Hi there, Human! It's your purrfectly finicky felines here. We've decided to take a moment from our busy schedule of napping, playing and being finicky eaters to write you a 'pawsome' letter. We absolutely love the yummy canned beef and turkey food you've been giving us. It's just so scrumptious. Plus, it doesn't have any chicken, so no more upset tummies. We're all purring in delight! The turkey and duck grain-free food is also a big hit with us. No more hair shedding and throwing up! We feel like kittens again. And oh, that grain-free white meat chicken and oat dry food! It's like a crunch party in our mouths. We hope they never change it. Thank you for giving us these delicious and healthy options. We're lucky cats! From: Bella, Oat, Marco and the 1 generic domestic cat
