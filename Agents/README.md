   ```

## Usage

### CSV File Processing

```python
from review_intelligence_agent import ReviewIntelligenceAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = ReviewIntelligenceAgent()

# Process CSV file with customer reviews
results = agent.process_csv_file("customer_reviews.csv", "output/")

# Results structure: {customer_id: {pet_name: PetInsight}}
for customer_id, pets_insights in results.items():
    print(f"Customer {customer_id}:")
    for pet_name, insight in pets_insights.items():
        print(f"  {pet_name}: {insight.confidence_score:.2f} confidence")
```

### CSV Data Loading and Grouping

```python
# Load CSV data
df = agent.load_reviews_from_csv("customer_reviews.csv")

# Group reviews by customer and pet
grouped_reviews = agent.group_reviews_by_customer_and_pet(df)

# Process specific customer-pet combination
customer_id = "CUST001"
pet_name = "Max"
reviews = grouped_reviews[customer_id][pet_name]
insight = agent.analyze_reviews(reviews, customer_id, pet_name)
```

### Running the Example

```bash
cd Agents
python test_review_agent.py
