From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

Hey there! It's me, your charming little Boston Terrier, the artist formerly known as Pet. First off, can we talk about how awesome you are? You let me be the dragon of the house with my Frisco Dragon Costume, and let's be honest, no one rocks those scales and wings quite like I do. I mean, have you seen the way I strut around the backyard like I'm guarding a treasure trove? It's all in the tail wag, my friend.

I wanted to bark out a little thank you for being the best human a dog could ever want. You always know when I need a good romp in the park or when it's time to break out my epic collection of PET N PET Dog Poop Bags (360 count, only the best for us, right?). Our walks are legendary, and those SportHooks Boston Terrier Dog Leash & Key Holders are not just a fashion statement‚Äîthey're a lifeline to all the adventures we embark on together.

I adore the way you indulge my playful spirit. Every time you toss a toy across the room, it's not just a game for me‚Äîit's an invitation to explore our world together. Your curiosity matches mine, and there's no better feeling than sniffing out new experiences by your side.

You know I'm a social pup, and I love that you never shy away from introducing me to new friends, both furry and human. You understand that my heart is as big as my bark and that my zest for life is contagious, even if I say so myself.

Thank you for always seeing the best in me, for knowing when I'm just being cheeky and when I simply need a snuggle. You make every day feel like a grand adventure, and for that, I'm eternally grateful.

Let's keep chasing our happily ever after, one wag at a time.

With all the tail wags and slobbery kisses,

Pet üêæ
