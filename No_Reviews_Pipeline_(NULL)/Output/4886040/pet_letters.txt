From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

Hey there, it‚Äôs me, Pet! Bet you didn't expect a letter from your playful companion, did you? Well, I‚Äôve been meaning to wag this out to you for a while now. I'm curled up on my favorite Frisco bed cover (the green one you got just for me) while I write this, feeling all sorts of grateful and warm.

You know, I'm a small-sized bundle of joy with a big heart and even bigger zoomies. Every day, I‚Äôm reminded of how lucky I am to have you. Whether we're playing fetch in the yard or just lounging around (mostly chewing on those BIXBI jerky treats‚Äîyum!), I cherish every moment.

I want to thank you for always thinking of my little joints. Those treats sure do the trick, keeping me active and ready for the next adventure or chase around the couch. It's like you know just how to keep me bouncing and tail-wagging all day long. And speaking of adventures, remember that time I mistook the pillows for my Four Paws training pads? Oops! Thanks for always having those handy, Febreze freshness and all.

I love our walks, even if my legs are a bit shorter and I need a boost sometimes. Your patience and those frequent snack breaks make each outing so much fun. You‚Äôve got a way of making even the simplest things feel like an exciting quest. And when it‚Äôs time to chill, those quiet moments we share, with me snuggled up against you, are my absolute favorite. I live for your cuddles and ear scratches‚Äîthey‚Äôre the best!

Thank you for being the best human a small, mixed-breed firecracker like me could ever ask for. Here's to more treats, more playtime, and more of that endless love you give so freely. I promise to keep filling your life with wagging tails, sloppy kisses, and boundless affection.

With all my loving paws,

Pet üêæ
