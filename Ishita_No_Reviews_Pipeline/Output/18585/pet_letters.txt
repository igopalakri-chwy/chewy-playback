From Pet:
------------------------------
Human,

Hey! It's me, your bouncing ball of fur and joy, Pet! I figured I'd take a little break from my never-ending quest to explore every corner of our home and write to you. I hope you don't mind the bit of drool on the paper‚ÄîI tend to get a little excited thinking about my favorite thing: YOU!

First things first, can we talk about those Walk About Grain-Free Goat cans? I mean, WOW. Every bite is a little piece of heaven, and I swear I do my best tricks just to see that can come out of the cupboard. And thank you for understanding my grain-free preference‚Äîwhat a thoughtful human you are! I'm not sure what "grain" even is, but I know I'm glad it's not in my food.

You know, there's this thing about you that I really love. It's the way you giggle when I tilt my head in that curious way, trying to make sense of your human words. Admittedly, I'm still working on understanding everything, but I'm sure I‚Äôm learning. Every word you speak is like a melody I want to hear on repeat.

And those walks we take, they are my absolute favorite adventures. Each leaf, stick, and mysterious sniff is a new discovery, and I adore how you indulge my inquisitive nature, even when I'm inspecting something as simple as a rock. Your patience and love are the best treats of all (though those Canine Caviar Buffalo Lungs come in a close second!).

Did you know I love how you always save a little extra cuddle time for me at the end of the day? As a puppy, I might have boundless energy, but curling up next to you while munching on my Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food is the paw-some ending to each day.

Thanks for being my partner in crime, my cuddle buddy, and the best human ever. I‚Äôm grateful that I get to grow alongside you, learning and loving every day. Here‚Äôs to more adventures, treats, and endless wagging of my tail just for you.

With all my puppy love,

Pet üêæ
