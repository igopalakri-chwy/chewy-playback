6205413,Cocoabean,"My cat had to have surgery on one of her paws. The vet said she'd have to wear an Ecollar for 10 days and I knew she would not be happy in the one that vet was going to provide her as she dislikes being restricted in general.

The vet had low hopes for this soft Ecollar but it worked very well for us. While I can't say she was happy about wearing it she acclimated fairly easily. I did start taking it off for her to eat because I'd only purchased one and didn't want food stains on it (buy 2 - this way you can wash one while the other is being worn). 

I liked that you could push it either towards the face, or towards the body so the cat can see better while walking. This was important as mine was wearing a ""cast"" and having enough trouble as it was getting around. 

I did prevent her from being able to reach the healing foot and lick on it, which was exactly what we'd hoped for. And she was able to sleep well with it since it cradled her head and neck nicely.

However, towards the end of the 10 days when she was moving around much better she managed to pull it loose enough to put her foot through - so she was walking with one foot out of the collar in the front. Not a huge deal but perhaps this is better for those instances where you only need to use it for a week or less. Hence my 4 star review, not 5 on this.

12682430,June,"Bought for my geriatric cat who used a top-entry for the past 15 years. His joints are getting stiff and I wanted to get him used to a ground-level box before it's too late. He kicks litter and pees on the side wall, so a covered box is necessary. 
I tried to give him an easy transition by allowing both old and new box, but he wouldn't use new box until old one was removed. But no issues once he switched. The ramp catches some of the litter that sticks to his feet, but I'd say overall tracking is same or a little worse than the top-entry box. But, what are you gonna do? Old cats need extra care.

28011658,Brynja,This Pet Gear Easy Pet Step is absolutely the best! And so is Chewy! I purchased a regular little 'stairs type' of pet steps for our one dog but it took months to teach her not to be afraid to use it so that she would use on her own. That effort was wasted when our other dog knocked her off of those steps and then she went back to being afraid to use them. Chewy was great and allowed me to return those. I saw this Pet Gear step and decided to try it. Our dog learned to use this Pet Gear Easy Step in one day!!  Now she uses it without hesitation or encouragement from us!   It's extremely stable on the ground - won't slide or rock. It's also wide and more like a ramp. Our dog is overweight and has short legs so we worried about her getting hurt jumping off of our bed. This Pet Gear step gives her the added height she needs to both go up and come back down more easily and safely.

I purchased a regular little 'stairs type' of pet steps for our one dog but it took months to teach her not to be afraid to use it so that she would use on her own. That effort was wasted when our other dog knocked her off of those steps and then she went back to being afraid to use them. Chewy was great and allowed me to return those. I saw this Pet Gear step and decided to try it. Our dog learned to use this Pet Gear Easy Step in one day!!  Now she uses it without hesitation or encouragement from us!   It's extremely stable on the ground - won't slide or rock. It's also wide and more like a ramp. Our dog is overweight and has short legs so we worried about her getting hurt jumping off of our bed. This Pet Gear step gives her the added height she needs to both go up and come back down more easily and safely. It's wonderful to have this type of step and to have Chewy guarantee their products!,Dog,Mixed / Unknown,A,FMLE,L,UNK,2017-10-11,97987,Pet Gear Easy Step Cat & Dog Stairs,5,2020-12-12 11:33:58.000
